“Every time we can bring in someone smarter than us and better than us, it’s going to be additive to the organization,” Flatt said.

Carney, a former Goldman Sachs banker, ran central banks from the global financial crisis to the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. He became governor of the Bank of Canada in 2008 and moved over to the same role at the Bank of England in 2013, before leaving that post in March and returning to Canada.

Brookfield will be targeting annual average returns in the mid-teens on the ESG funds.

Climate ‘Discipline’

The fund management industry’s growing focus on investments that take into account ESG issues has expanded into a US$30 trillion-plus business. The US SIF Foundation said in its 2018 report on sustainable, responsible and impact investing trends that more than one of every $4 under professional management is invested utilizing ESG criteria.

But Korchinski-Paquet’s sister said Wednesday that their family is “disgusted” by the SIU’s findings.

“We’re not OK with the way the system works. We’re not OK with it — nobody is,” Renee Korchinski told a news conference outside the apartment building where her sister died.

“It seems like nobody’s getting justice or what they deserve. What happened to my sister shouldn’t have happened to her, but it did, so people need to be held accountable for their actions.”

Korchinski-Paquet’s death sparked protests in the city and calls to change the way police deal with people experiencing mental health crises.

Martino, in his report, noted that the 29-year-old died just days after George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, was killed when an officer pressed a knee against his neck for nearly nine minutes, at a time when there was increased scrutiny over the relationship between police and racialized people.

In Toronto, thousands of protesters took to the streets on May 30, three days after Korchinski-Paquet’s death. Several smaller marches followed over the next few weeks.

The SIU report notes that Korchinski-Paquet’s death sparked “important conversations” about the ways in which police interact with Black and Indigenous people, but says there was no evidence of police wrongdoing or “overt” racism in the incident itself.

Martino said race may have been a factor in the events leading up to the death of Korchinski-Paquet, who was both Indigenous and Black, but that examining systemic issues in policing is not his purview."

In other words, it’s Becki’s fault.

From my vantage point as a scholar who studies religion and gender, this comment from Falwell is revealing.

How male public figures react to a sex scandal can be a very complex process. In trying to preserve what is left of their reputations, my research indicates that they will often attempt to prove that they remain a “real man” – both a loving, devoted husband and a strong, virile leader. This behavior makes sense when one understands the conservative Christian gender roles that inspire them.

Under conservative Christian gender norms, men are described not only as naturally sexual, but also as divinely designed to be far more sexual than women. In fact, male sexuality is often depicted as out of control. The point of marriage, many evangelicals claim, is to harness that male sexuality so that it is productive rather than wild and unbounded.

This view of marriage may strike many as archaic, but these ideas nevertheless permeate part of American culture – one can see it in the “boys will be boys” defense of bad male behavior.

Such ideas also strongly influence how large swaths of the public tend to view sex scandals. Generally speaking, while the public holds the offending politician responsible, they are also often eager to condemn other figures who were involved for leading him astray.

More specifically, my research shows that women who are in any way associated with sex scandals are much more likely to be demonized or blamed for the sexual incident in question. Even when they are the innocent party, they can be portrayed as power-hungry strategists who stayed in a bad marriage to elevate themselves or enablers who give all women a bad name by sticking up for another adulterer."

The lobby group is calling for an extension of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) beyond the end of 2020, and a streamlined rent relief program for business owners, among other things. It is also calling on the Trudeau government to shift its tone when addressing the Canadian public, by encouraging people to return to their normal lives rather than focusing solely on health risks.

To date, the CEWS — which covers 75 per cent of eligible employers’ payrolls up to a maximum of $847 per employee per week — has paid out $29.92 billion to nearly 300,000 applicants. The vast majority of those businesses applied to receive less than $100,000 per application.

Earlier this summer, the agency also promised to release a complete list of successful CEWS applicants by the end of August. That list has yet to be published.

The CRA has records of those who received the benefit and for what period. These records will be used ... to validate eligibility

Critics and experts have consistently raised concerns about fraud within the federal government’s COVID-19 financial aid programs since the beginning of the pandemic earlier this year.

The biggest concerns lie around the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB), which were originally designed to be quickly accessible with very little pre-payment verification.

Since the programs’ launch, multiple media outlets have reported on identify theft linked to CERB, false applications and even fake consultants who promise to help Canadians to apply for CERB in exchange for payment, even though they may be ineligible.

Another issue is CERB “double-dippers” — people who applied and received twice the amount of CERB they were entitled to since the beginning of April. In May, a government official told parliamentarians that they had already identified at least 200,000 cases of double payments.

According to the CRA’s national business resumption plan published in late June, the agency plans on launching verification programs centred around CERB, CEWS and CESB in September.

‘The CRA has records of those who received the benefit and for what period. These records will be used, along with tax slips received from employers and other relevant information available to the CRA, to validate eligibility,” Biram said.

“Where eligibility is in question, a review will be conducted to ensure that recipients were only paid amounts they were entitled to. In cases where claimants are found to be ineligible, they will be contacted to make arrangements to repay any applicable amounts.”

The lobby group is calling for an extension of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) beyond the end of 2020, and a streamlined rent relief program for business owners, among other things. It is also calling on the Trudeau government to shift its tone when addressing the Canadian public, by encouraging people to return to their normal lives rather than focusing solely on health risks.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices have been hitting a series of record highs recently, but the TSX index continues to languish more than 1,300 points lower than its all-time high reached earlier this year just before the pandemic sent the bulls stampeding out of the market.

The domestic market index stands at just over 16,617 points this year, still shy of the 17,944 all-time record seen in February.

The main TSX index is now nearly 3 per cent shy of erasing its losses for the year, after falling 34 per cent by the late March. In contrast, the S&P 500 is now up 11 per cent for the year, after falling 27.67 per cent for the year by late March, according to data gleaned from Yahoo Finance.

While the S&P/TSX Composite Index has grown 6.33 per cent in the current quarter, it has been an uneven recovery for the most part this year, with Shopify Inc. (up 157 per cent) and Barrick Gold Corp. (+57 per cent) doing the heavy lifting and adding about 800 points to the index, according to Bank of Montreal research.

The performance of the various sectors mirrors the real-life performance of these industries: The S&P Capped Information Technology Index has expanded more than 42 per cent year-to-date, with the S&P TSX Capped Energy index at other end of the spectrum, down almost exactly more than 42 per cent. The S&P/TSX Capped Materials Index surged around 22 per cent year-to-date, with S&P/TSX Global Gold Index up nearly 38 per cent.

But there are plenty of laggards: The S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index is down 21 per cent, S&P/TSX Capped Health Care Index has fallen 32 per cent, S&P/TSX Capped Real Estate Index is 19 per cent in the red, and the S&P/TSX Capped Financial Index is 13 per cent lower.

In reality, a number of TSX blue-chips are weighing down the index. These include Bombardier Inc. (-76 per cent), Cineplex Inc. (-73 per cent), Air Canada (-66 per cent), Suncor Energy Inc. (-48 per cent), RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust (-39 per cent), Teck Resources Ltd. (-35 per cent), Gildan Activewear Inc. (-30 per cent), Blackberry Inc. (-24 per cent), Canopy Growth Corp.

(-12 per cent), BMO research shows.

To be clear, the S&P 500’s new record also masks weaknesses in the stock performance of a number of major American household names.

“It’s well-known that the comeback has been narrowly based, led especially by just a few high-flying tech stocks. But, just as an illustration of the extent to which much of the rest of the market is lagging, consider these… household names below which are all still down by at least double-digits so far this year. Note the diversity of names,” Douglas Porter, chief economist at BMO, wrote in a note this week.

Some of the biggest American brands deep in negative territory include American Airlines (down 58 per cent), Boeing (-49 per cent), General Electric (-44 per cent), Exxon Mobil Corp. (-41 per cent) and Bank of America (-29 per cent)."

There was little surprise when Chrystia Freeland was announced as the new Minister of Finance last week, after her predecessor Bill Morneau abruptly resigned.

Freeland was already deputy prime minister, already considered the second most powerful role in cabinet, and her responsibilities have been continuously growing during the past few years: She took the lead in negotiating a new trade agreement with the U.S., and has been orchestrating the country’s response as the U.S. reasserts tariffs on Canadian aluminum in the first signs that another trade war is brewing with our closest ally.

“There is one area where we need to dig in more. That is the measure of our inflation target,” Wilkins said. “Many people feel that inflation is higher than reported.”

The Bank of Canada is in the middle of a major review of how it sets interest rates. While holding consultations last year, it discovered that a critical mass of Canadians think the CPI is an abstraction that has little connection to their daily lives. The lockdowns exacerbated the problem, as shopping patterns shifted dramatically. We essentially stopped spending on recreation and travel, and instead bought more at grocery stores. Yet the CPI continued to factor in what was happening with movie tickets and restaurant meals even though those things no longer mattered to people.

“The price of meat has risen by more than four per cent since February,” Wilkins said. “That doesn’t feel like low inflation to me or to many families, yet measured inflation is close to zero when you consider the full basket of goods and services.”

Evidence that the public is becoming skeptical of the way statisticians measure inflation adds a new dimension to the Bank of Canada’s research program."

In other words, it’s Becki’s fault.

From my vantage point as a scholar who studies religion and gender, this comment from Falwell is revealing.

How male public figures react to a sex scandal can be a very complex process. In trying to preserve what is left of their reputations, my research indicates that they will often attempt to prove that they remain a “real man” – both a loving, devoted husband and a strong, virile leader. This behavior makes sense when one understands the conservative Christian gender roles that inspire them.

Under conservative Christian gender norms, men are described not only as naturally sexual, but also as divinely designed to be far more sexual than women. In fact, male sexuality is often depicted as out of control. The point of marriage, many evangelicals claim, is to harness that male sexuality so that it is productive rather than wild and unbounded.

This view of marriage may strike many as archaic, but these ideas nevertheless permeate part of American culture – one can see it in the “boys will be boys” defense of bad male behavior.

Such ideas also strongly influence how large swaths of the public tend to view sex scandals. Generally speaking, while the public holds the offending politician responsible, they are also often eager to condemn other figures who were involved for leading him astray.

More specifically, my research shows that women who are in any way associated with sex scandals are much more likely to be demonized or blamed for the sexual incident in question. Even when they are the innocent party, they can be portrayed as power-hungry strategists who stayed in a bad marriage to elevate themselves or enablers who give all women a bad name by sticking up for another adulterer."

Which is why he finds it “absurd” that Heath Canada says the risks of home or self-testing kits outweigh the benefits and that it will reject applications for such devices “without compelling new evidence to the contrary.”





The federal health agency worries that, “without the guidance of a health-care professional,” people would use the home test kit improperly or “misinterpret the results” and that it could be impossible to collect test results — information that’s key to “important health decisions involving disease control during an outbreak,” the department said in an emailed statement."

Blauel is also seeking an injunction which would prevent future editions or adaptations of memoirs from discussing the marriage, noting that having to “relive her past constantly” has caused psychiatric harm, according to The Independent.

She states that John must have been aware of how digging up details from his romantic past would cause her mental health issues, because she had suffered panic attacks and bouts of depression during their time together.

In new legal papers filed in London’s High Court and obtained by The Times this week, Blauel reveals one particular low point came just days after they tied the knot, while they were on the traditional vacation in St. Tropez, France.

She recalls taking an overdose of prescription medication Valium after John informed her “the marriage was not working and that he wanted her to leave” three days into their stay, reports the BBC.

Blauel also recalls an incident “in or about 1985”, when she had to excuse herself from a lunch the then-couple had hosted for members of Britain’s royal family after experiencing a panic attack while chatting to Princess Margaret.

John has previously spoken about his “huge guilt and regret” over hurt he caused Blauel during the relationship.

The singer, who ‘came out’ as gay in 1988 and now has a family with his film producer husband David Furnish, has denied breaching the terms of their divorce agreement or causing any “psychological harm” to his ex, and in a new statement responding to the latest allegations, his legal representative Jenny Afia insisted, “Elton has always respected Renate’s privacy and will continue to do so.”

However, she described how “baffling” it was for Blauel to centre her case “around privacy when at every stage of these proceedings Renate has chosen to file these claims in the public domain”.

Afia continued, “This only goes to show the true purpose of this claim which is to extract a large sum of money from Elton and tarnish his name publicly with falsehoods.”

The court case is ongoing."

Golfweek’s Best Courses You Can Play 2020 in Minnesota1.","In a state known for snow – my wife loves to tell a story of her hair freezing solid as a new student at Macalester College – Minnesota offers a wide array of top golf courses that might surprise players not familiar with the Land of 10,000 Lakes. And yes, those lakes certainly come into play on more than a few holes.

But even at a resort known for skiing, it’s not the slopes that pull golfers off the highway. It’s the sand.

The Quarry at Giants Ridge in Biwabik opened in 2003 atop an old sand and gravel excavation site. Course architect Jeffrey Brauer – who also laid out the resort’s Legend course – fashioned wide fairways and severe hazards on the 7,201-yard Quarry. With significant elevation changes, a retained sense of the site’s history with brown spoil piles still in play, and a dramatic set of par 5s, the Quarry provides a much tougher test than the Legend track.

Golfweek’s network of raters certainly approves, voting the Quarry as the No. 1 public-access course in Minnesota on Golfweek’s Best Courses You Can Play list each year since 2015. Golfweek ranks courses by compiling the average ratings – on a points basis of 1 to 10 – of its more than 750 raters to create several industry-leading lists of courses, including the popular Best Courses You Can Play list.

The Quarry also ranks No. 119 on Golfweek’s Best ultra-elite list of modern courses in United State built after 1960.

The Legend certainly isn’t to be forgotten, though. Built by Brauer in 1997, the 6,930-yard Legend ranks No. 10 in the state on the Best Courses You Can Play list. The Legend and the Quarry make for a potent combo that shouldn’t be missed in Minnesota.

And Brauer wasn’t done leaving his mark in Minnesota. His Wilderness at Fortune Bay opened in 2004 in Tower, also to rave reviews. The course, which skirts Lake Vermillion and plays through woodlands laced with exposed rock, is the No. 2 course in Minnesota on Golfweek’s Best Courses You Can Play list in 2020. It also ranks as No. 7 on Golfweek’s Best 2019 list of casino courses in the U.S., and it is No. 200 on Golfweek’s Best 2020 list of modern courses.

Both the Quarry at Giants Ridge and Wilderness at Fortune Bay also rank inside the 2020 Top 100 Best Courses You Can Play list in the U.S., the Quarry at No. 43 among all U.S. public-access courses and Wilderness at No. 72.

Those are heady successes for a state that sees an annual average of 70 inches of snow in some places. But Minnesota is full of surprises when it comes to elite golf.

Golfweek averaged the ratings of its top five 2020 Best Courses You Can Play in each state this year to compare elite public-access golf around the country, and the North Star state ranked an impressive 16th. Oregon tops that list, but Minnesota ranks ahead of sunny destinations such as Texas and Georgia and narrowly trails Arizona.

It all proves that good golf, even in a state where the golf season typically runs only from April to October, is where you find it.

Golfweek rater comment

The Quarry at Giants Ridge is the headliner at this northern Minnesota resort. Jeff Brauer’s second (course) for Giants Ridge is probably his masterpiece, laid out over the remains of a sand quarry that provide a compelling canvas. The effect of returning an already-altered landscape to a connection with nature resonates and presents a truly unique result. Each hole presents a question, and the variety of these questions keeps the experience fresh each round one plays here. – Jake Marvin, Eden Prairie, Minn.

How we rate them

The members of our course-ratings panel continually evaluate courses and rate them based on our 10 criteria. They also file a single, overall rating on each course. Those overall ratings on each course are averaged together to produce a final rating for each course. Then each course is ranked against other courses in its state, or nationally, to produce the final rankings."

Tiger Woods was able to advance to the second of the three season-ending events despite a disappointing finish last week at the Northern Trust. The 15-time major champion slipped in the FedEx Cup standings from 49th to 57th in the and will need to finish in at least the top-eight if he wants to qualify for next week’s Tour Championship at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta.

Below, we look at Woods’ odds to win the 2020 BMW Championship and his most interesting prop bets for this week’s PGA Tour event.

BMW Championship: Fantasy golf power rankings

History at Olympia Fields

Woods is one of few in the field with any meaningful experience at Olympia Fields CC. The last PGA Tour event played here was the 2003 US Open. Woods finished in a tie for 20th at plus-3. His second round of 4-under, 66 was his best.

The par-70 course measures 7,366 yards and features Bluegrass (Poa Annua) greens. The fairways are guarded by tight tree lines and fairway bunkers further narrow the landing areas. The heavily-sloped greens are the course’s greatest challenge to scoring low.

Odds to win

Odds provided by BetMGM; access USA TODAY Sports’ betting odds for a full list. Lines last updated Tuesday at 6:22 a.m. ET.

Woods is +4000 to win the 2020 BMW Championship, something he’ll need to come close to doing in order to extend his season. He has won this tournament twice before (2007 and 2009), but both of those victories were at different courses.

Tiger finished T-37 while experimenting with a new putter at the PGA Championship. He lost 0.02 strokes per round putting in the event and reverted back to his famed Scotty Cameron flat stick last week at the Northern Trust. He went on to lose 0.44 strokes per round and finished T-58.

He dropped to ninth in the Golfweek/Sagarin world rankings with last week’s result but is still a relative value while ranked 16th by the betting odds. His final-round 66 last week is enough incentive to place a small wager on Tiger Woods to win the BMW Championship.

New to sports betting? A $10 bet on Tiger to win the BMW Championship would return a profit of $400.

Best props

Top-10 finish: +300

Using the motivation of continuing on through the FedExCup Playoffs, place a small wager on Tiger to finish inside the top 10 and give himself a chance to get to East Lake for a triple-up on your investment. He has just one top 10 this season other than his Zozo Championship victory, but he finally showed some promise with his final round last week.

Lowest score over 72 holes – Group D: +340

Woods has +340 odds to post the best tournament score in a group with Harris English (+300), Kevin Kisner (+330), Tyrrell Hatton (+400) and Viktor Hovland (+400). All four have been in a better form of late and much more active since the PGA Tour’s restart.

PASS on a bet here, as Tiger is more likely to be focused on the US Open (Sept. 17-20) and Masters (Nov. 12-15) in the fall schedule.

Fantasy golf power rankings

Odds provided by BetMGM; access USA TODAY Sports’ betting odds for a full list. Odds last updated Monday at 5:15 p.m. ET.

30. Matt Kuchar (+6000)

Tied for 18th last week following his missed cut at the PGA Championship. He has been quiet this season since winning the SMBC Singapore Open with no other top 10s but for a T-2 at the Genesis Invitational. He needs a big week to crack the top 30 and get to East Lake.

29. Corey Conners (+10000)

Fourth among those who made the cut last week with 0.75 Strokes Gained: Off-the-Tee per round, according to Data Golf. His approach game wasn’t as sharp as usual, preventing a top finish.

28. Matthew Wolff (+5000)

Has now made five straight cuts, including his T-4 at the PGA Championship to move up to 33rd in the FedEx Cup standings. He has been especially sharp off-the-tee of late and ranks 13th on Tour for the 2019-20 season.

27. Tiger Woods (+4000)

A disappointing showing last week but closed it off with a Sunday round of 66 to move into a tie for 58th. He dropped to 57th in the FedEx Cup standings and needs to finish in the top eight this week to have a chance of moving on.

26. Louis Oosthuizen (+5000)

Enters the week 70th in the FedEx Cup standings and qualified for this event with his strong T-13 finish last week. Tied for sixth in the no-cut WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational earlier this month.

25. Abraham Ancer (+6000)

Missed the cut last week at plus-1 while uncharacteristically losing 1.57 strokes per round from tee-to-green. He’s averaging 0.95 strokes per round in that category in 2020 and should rebound.

24. Tony Finau (+3500)

Snapped a streak of five straight made cuts last week. He had previously rung up three top 10s and two top 5s in those five events. Ranks 29th in the FedEx Cup standings and is just inside the line for the Tour Championship.

23. Ryan Palmer (+8000)

His T-8 showing last week was his third top 10 in eight events since the restart. His short game has been exceptionally strong, but he’ll need to be better off-the-tee this week.

22. Patrick Cantlay (+3300)

Lost 1.73 strokes per round putting last week in an abysmal performance on the greens resulting in a missed cut. Sits 37th in the FEC standings while looking for his first top 10 since a T-7 at the Workday Charity Open.

21. Hideki Matsuyama (+3300)

Three straight top-30 placings and four in his last five events. Typically shows well in the no-cut WGC events with two career wins and a T-6 at the WGC-Mexico Championship earlier this year.

Looking to place a bet on the 2020 BMW Championship? Get some action on it at BetMGM. Bet Now!

20. Sungjae Im (+6600)

Out of form with four missed cuts since the restart. The winner of The Honda Classic still ranks eighth in the season-long standings and is competing for starting strokes at the Tour Championship.

19. Gary Woodland (+6600)

The 2019 US Open champion has no wins but six top-10 finishes this year to sit 39th in the FEC standings. He has a great approach game and is typically much better on the greens than his 1.28 strokes lost putting per round last week.

18. Paul Casey (+5000)

Has disappointed since his T-2 finish at the PGA Championship with a T-31 at the Wyndham Championship and T-49 last week. He’s one of few in the field with course history at Olympia Fields CC from the 2003 US Open, even though he missed the cut that week.

17. Harris English (+4000)

The only golfer in the top 10 of the FedEx Cup standings without a win this season. English has six top 10s including last week’s distant runner-up finish to Dustin Johnson.

16. Jason Day (+3000)

Missed the cut at The Northern Trust to snap a resurgent stretch of four consecutive top 10s. Injuries finally no longer appear to be an issue and his expert ball-striking has returned.

15. Adam Scott (+4500)

Tied for 58th last week to slip from 36th to 38th in the FedEx Cup standings. Will be playing just his third event since the restart and needs a big move to play next week.

FedEx Cup standings: Who’s in, who’s out as playoffs move on

14. Patrick Reed (+3300)

Couldn’t defend his Northern Trust title with the move from Liberty National Golf Club to TPC Boston. Lost a rare 0.27 strokes per round putting to finish T-49 at minus-7.

13. Viktor Hovland (+3500)

Awful around-the-green last week but excellent with the putter; gaining 1.30 strokes per round. Averaging 1.19 SG: Tee-to-Green in 2020.

12. Xander Schauffele (+1800)

Ranks third on Tour in 2020 with 2.11 total strokes gained per round. Has no wins but six top 10s on the season.

11. Kevin Kisner (+3300)

Followed up a T-3 at the Wyndham Championship with a T-4 last week. His putter gets a large share of the credit with just 0.17 SG: Off-the-Tee at TPC Boston.

10. Tyrrell Hatton (+4500)

Seventeenth in the FedEx Cup standings and his nine events played are the fewest of anyone currently in the top 30. Gaining 1.42 strokes per round from tee-to-green.

9. Rory McIlroy (+1800)

It’s easy to forget Rory’s play earlier this season due to his results since the restart. He’s still 12th in the FedEx Cup standings with a win and six top 10s on the season but has nothing better than a T-11 at the Travelers Championship since mid-June.

8. Webb Simpson (+1800)

Simpson has strung together a T-3 and T-6 the last two weeks and enters the BMW Championship third in the FedEx Cup standings. He has two wins and eight top 10s on the season.

7. Justin Thomas (+1200)

The only three-time winner on the PGA Tour this season and his nine top 10s are tied for the Tour lead. Has disappointed in his last two events since winning the WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational.

6. Scottie Scheffler (+2800)

Back-to-back T-4s at the PGA Championship and Northern Trust. Ranked second to Johnson with 2.39 SG: Tee-to-Green per round last week.

More: Assistant pro steps in to caddie for Scheffler at Northern Trust

5. Bryson DeChambeau (+1400)

Surprisingly missed the cut last week at a course he was seemingly well-suited for. Still leads the Tour with 1.174 SG: Off-the-Tee per round and ranked second in last week’s field with 1.15 per round despite missing the weekend. Won the 2015 US Amateur at Olympia Fields but under the match-play format.

4. Daniel Berger (+2000)

In the best form of anyone with 2.77 strokes gained per round on the average Tour pro over his last 20 rounds. Gaining 1.96 total strokes per round in 2020.

3. Collin Morikawa (+2000)

The winner of the 2020 PGA Championship and Workday Charity Open is just eighth by the betting odds to win this week. He slipped to fifth in the FedEx Cup standings with a missed cut last week and will be jostling for starting strokes at the Tour Championship.

2. Dustin Johnson (+800)

Last week’s winner by 11 strokes, there should only be a minor concern if Johnson takes his foot off the gas a little bit while seeking his first FedExCup win next week.

What’s in the bag? Check out Johnson’s clubs

1. Jon Rahm (+900)

The No. 1 player in the Golfweek/Sagarin rankings led the field in SG: Off-the-Tee last week for his best result (T-6) since winning the Memorial Tournament.

Essential resources

COVID-19, or the novel coronavirus, has killed thousands of people around the world since early this year. Later in this guide, you’ll see an overview of how the world is mobilizing to stop its spread and save lives, but first, here are some essential links answering key questions about how all Canadians can help. We have a daily coronavirus newsletter.

Watch: How can you stop the spread of coronavirus in your community? The Globe offers pointers on hygiene and physical distancing.

What we know so far about the disease

Symptoms

The new illness that emerged last December in China – officially called COVID-19, previously known as 2019-nCoV – is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Corona means “crown” or “halo” in Latin, describing the viruses’ typical shape when seen under an electron microscope. The common cold is a type of coronaviral illness, but it tends to cause nasal congestion, which COVID-19 doesn’t always do. COVID-19′s symptoms (dry coughing, fever and aches) resemble more serious and dangerous coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS. Initially the symptoms can also look like flu, which is caused by a different virus type, but don’t let the similarity fool you: COVID-19 is far more dangerous (more on that below).

Human coronaviruses most commonly spread from an infected person to others through: The air by coughing and sneezing Close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands Touching the eyes, nose or mouth after touching an infected surface Rarely, fecal contamination WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF THE VIRUS? Headache Dry cough Fever In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death SOME FACTS ABOUT THE VIRUS Belongs to large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS and SARS Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people There are no specific treatments for coronaviruses, but symptoms can be treated MURAT YÜKSELIR / THE GLOBE AND MAIL, SOURCE: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Health Canada, WHO Human coronaviruses most commonly spread from an infected person to others through: The air by coughing and sneezing Close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands Touching the eyes, nose or mouth after touching an infected surface Rarely, fecal contamination WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF THE VIRUS?

How COVID-19 CAN KILL YOU

COVID-19′s death rate varies considerably from country to country and among age groups, but even conservative estimates put it tens of times higher than seasonal influenza (0.1 per cent), though generally lower than SARS (10 per cent). The graphics below offer a step-by-step explanation of COVID-19′s lethal effects on the body in severe cases.

VIRUS The virus enters the lungs and attaches itself to cells which make up the lungs’ protective lining. CELLS RNA RECEPTOR VIRUS Once attached to a cell’s receptor, the virus injects its RNA into the cell, providing it with the blueprint to build copies of the virus. IMMUNE CELL INFECTED DEAD The infected cell eventually self-destructs, releasing the virus to infect neighbouring cells. Exponential growth in infected cells triggers an excessive response by the immune system. Immune cells sent to fight the virus begin to destroy both infected and healthy cells. ALVEOLI BACTERIA BACTERIAL INFECTION If enough of the protective lining is destroyed, it leaves the alveoli – the tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs – vulnerable to bacterial infection. This can lead to severe respiratory problems, making mechanical ventilation necessary to help the patient survive. The immune system can become overwhelmed while the bacteria multiply. If bacteria enter the blood, they can overrun the body and cause death.

Transmission

Though SARS had a higher death rate than COVID-19, it infected and killed far fewer people (8,098 infections and 774 deaths worldwide, according to the U.S. CDC’s estimates). One possible reason for this is that unlike SARS, whose carriers generally knew they were sick, the new coronavirus is transmissible before symptoms develop. On average, it takes about five days for people infected with COVID-19 to show symptoms, according to a U.S.-based team’s estimates published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. SARS’s incubation period was longer, about 10 days.

Testing

Health officials in Canada and other countries have a test to make sure whether a patient has COVID-19 or some other illness. Depending on where you live in Canada, these may be available either at dedicated clinics or in at-home visits from health officials. If you start showing the symptoms of COVID-19, contact your local health authority or family doctor and do as they advise.

Physical distancing

Various governments have introduced new limits on public assembly and events since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in mid-March.

Public gatherings: Provincial governments used state-of-emergency powers to limit public assemblies over the spring, though those rules have relaxed or changed over the summer. Check our guide of the rules by province and territory to see what it’s like near you.

Check our guide of the rules by province and territory to see what it’s like near you. Essential businesses: Most provinces issued lists of businesses deemed “essential” and barred others from operating, except as work-from-home or e-commerce operations. Since June, a lot of the closed businesses have reopened under stricter rules for physical distancing.

Travel restrictions

International travel: The United States and Canada suspended non-essential border traffic, except for essential supply chains, on March 20. Canada had already barred most non-American foreign nationals from entering. Canadians abroad are allowed to come home and self-isolate for 14 days, but only if they’re asymptomatic: Airlines will refuse passage to anyone showing COVID-19 symptoms.

Interprovincial and intercity travel: Getting on a train, plane or bus will likely involve wearing a mask. Some provinces and territories closed their borders, and have reopened them only selectively, such as the “Atlantic bubble” that allows free movement among Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick.

Federal economic relief

Since mid-March, the Trudeau government’s stimulus measures have grown to tens of billions worth of direct supports and tax deferrals, which Ottawa has continued to add to or extend. The measures include:

Canada Emergency Relief Benefit: A $2,000-a-month, 16-week emergency benefit to pay workers whose income drops to zero, even if they have been furloughed by employers but technically still have jobs. CERB runs out on Sept. 26, to be replaced by a revised employment insurance program that more people are eligible for, and $37-billion in new income supports over all.

Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy: Three months of support for businesses to cover employees’ wages, initially 10 per cent but later raised to 75 per cent. Businesses of any size, including charities and non-profits, are eligible if they can show a 30-per-cent revenue drop or more.

How do I ‘flatten the curve’?

When diseases reach uninfected populations, a graph of the new infections will generally follow a curve: Infections rise, then peak, then fall. You’ll see a lot of officials talk about “flattening the curve,” or preventing the peak infections from exceeding their health systems’ ability to handle them. A big part of this is physical distancing: Avoiding public gatherings, staying home from work or school and changing social habits, like waving instead of shaking hands. If front-line health workers are spared from a sudden and overwhelming increase in new cases, lives will be saved. And when the pandemic is over, those workers will be better-equipped to act once there’s a vaccine available for the new disease, like the one researchers are racing to develop for COVID-19.

HOW TO ISOLATE AT HOME WHEN YOU HAVE COVID-19 Isolation means staying at home when you are sick with COVID-19 and avoiding contact with other people to help prevent the spread of disease to others in your home and your community. If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, it is expected that you take the following measures. AVOID CONTAMINATING COMMON ITEMS AND SURFACES At least once daily, clean and disinfect surfaces that you touch often, like toilets, bedside tables, doorknobs, phones and television remotes. Do not share personal items with others, such as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic devices. CARE FOR YOURSELF Monitor your symptoms as directed by your health-care provider or Public Health Authority. If your symptoms get worse, immediately contact your health-care provider or Public Health Authority and follow their instructions. LIMIT CONTACT WITH OTHERS Do not leave home unless absolutely necessary, such as to seek medical care. Do not go to school, work, other public areas or use public transportation (e.g. buses, taxis). Arrange to have groceries and supplies dropped off at your door to minimize contact. KEEP YOUR HANDS CLEAN Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and dry with disposable paper towels or dry reusable towel, replacing it when it becomes wet.

Stay at home: The country’s top public health officials have urged Canadians to avoid going out unless necessary for grocery runs, exercise or medical emergencies, but the relaxation of local states of emergency has given people a wider range of activities. But if you’ve got COVID-19 symptoms like dry coughing, fever or difficulty breathing, or have been in contact with someone showing those symptoms, self-isolation for 14 days is crucial.

But if you’ve got COVID-19 symptoms like dry coughing, fever or difficulty breathing, or have been in contact with someone showing those symptoms, self-isolation for 14 days is crucial. Stay apart: When you do go outside, stay at a distance of two metres (about the length of a hockey stick) from other people.

When you do go outside, stay at a distance of two metres (about the length of a hockey stick) from other people. Wear a mask if you can: Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer has stressed since early April that non-medical masks can help stop the spread of COVID-19, and while they’re not mandatory everywhere, they may be required on public transit, in stores or in other spaces where you may be in close contact with others. Here’s a primer on how to choose a mask that’s right for you and use it properly.

International travel

Flights are restricted: Only Canadian citizens, permanent residents and some exempted groups of foreign nationals, like agricultural workers and international students, are allowed into the country right now. That’s only if they don’t have COVID-19 symptoms: Airlines have to refuse passage to anyone showing them.

Self-isolation is mandatory: All Canadians coming home from abroad are required to go home immediately and stay there for 14 days. They should get groceries and supplies delivered rather than going to the store. Under federal law, authorities can charge up to six-figure fines or put people in jail for refusing to do this.

Planes and trains: If you’re travelling between cities by air or rail, make sure you’re feeling okay first. Anyone who flies or rides a Via train must wear a mask that covers the face and mouth, and temperature checks are mandatory before boarding planes.

The province is at Level 2 of its five-level alert system, which increased the gathering limit, reopened more public facilities and allowed more free movement within the province. Level 1 will be as close to a “new normal” as possible until a vaccine or effective treatment for COVID-19 is found.

Public gatherings: Restricted to 50 or fewer people outdoors or at functions like weddings and funerals. Two individual households are allowed to form exclusive “double bubbles” to gather together in person, and each bubble can invite up to six others from different households to join, as long as they’re not exceeding the limits for their own bubbles by doing so.

Phase 4 of the Renew PEI Together plan, which began on June 26, raised the gathering limits again and reopened accommodations to non-islanders, including bed-and-breakfasts, inns and campgrounds. The phased plan has no specifics on when PEI might allow free access to non-Atlantic provinces.

Public gatherings: Personal gatherings are limited to 20 people or fewer outdoors and 15 indoors, with physical distancing. As of June 26, more than 50 are allowed at “larger organized gatherings” like weddings, funerals and graduations.

Since June, most businesses and community activities have been reopened with physical distancing in place, and since the start of July, the Atlantic bubble allows Nova Scotians to more freely travel within the region.

Public gatherings: Events like weddings, funerals, festivals and concerts can have up to 250 people outdoors and 200 (maximum half-capacity) indoors, and family gatherings can have up to 50. Physical distancing is required. But Nova Scotians are also allowed to form 10-person circles that can meet without physical distancing.

All health regions of New Brunswick are currently in “yellow” mode, the second-lowest of four colour-coded stages in its recovery plan. The lowest stage, green, won’t be reached until there is a COVID-19 vaccine or another effective method for preventing the virus’s spread.

Public gatherings: Restricted to 10 or fewer people, with the limit for outdoor gatherings in most of New Brunswick due to increase to 50 in June. One household is allowed to “bubble” with one other household.

Quebec

Montreal reopened at a much slower pace than the rest of Quebec, but relaxation measures in June brought them a little closer together: Restaurants can now have dine-in service provincewide, and gyms, arenas, concert venues and movie theatres can open too.

Public gatherings: Limited to 50 people outdoors and 10 indoors, with no more than three households at any one indoor gathering. Some indoor venues like restaurants and theatres can have 50 people at a time if physical distancing is in place. Children under 16 are also able to interact at a closer distance than adults: One metre instead of two.

As of July 31, all of Ontario’s health regions except Windsor-Essex are at Stage 3 of the reopening plan. Stage 3 still prohibits overnight camping, saunas, dancing at restaurants and bars and table games at casinos.

Public gatherings: In most of the 34 health regions, gatherings of 50 inside and 100 outside are allowed as of July 17, as long as physical distancing is observed. That doesn’t include the Windsor-Essex area, where the Stage 2 limits of 10 people (indoors or outdoors) still apply. Ontarians can also form “social circles” of up to 10 people that they can visit freely, but are discouraged from joining more than one circle at a time.

Saskatchewan was the first province to set specific dates for reopening its economy, a five-stage process that is now in Phase 4.2. Indoor pools, indoor sports and casinos are due to reopen in the next stage of the plan. Details are scarce about what Phase 5 would look like, but the province might consider lifting limits on public gatherings.

Public gatherings: Restricted to 30 indoors and outdoors, with exceptions for church services, weddings and funerals (up to 150 people or a third of the venue’s capacity, whichever is less) and graduations (30 graduates and an overall attendance of 150).

Northwest Territories

Since June 12, the territory has been in Phase 2 of a four-phase plan. The implementation of the next phase depends on when the rest of Canada clears a second wave of infections, which could come between August and October. The final phase would lift all restrictions, but only if there is a vaccine or an effective treatment accessible within the territory.

Public gatherings: Outdoor gatherings of up to 25 indoors and 50 outdoors are allowed with physical distancing, but at home, Northwest Territories residents can have only five people over, to a maximum of 10. The government recommends having a “fave five” who can come over to limit mixing among different households.

Latest coverage

Province by province

Ontario: The most populous province will get the largest share – about $760-million – of the $2-billion Safe Return to Class Fund unveiled by the federal government on Wednesday, as pressure rises on the Ford government to bring class sizes down. Ottawa is also setting aside $112-million for First Nations schools.

Ottawa is also setting aside $112-million for First Nations schools. Atlantic Canada: Sports, extracurriculars and physical education will resume in New Brunswick when schools reopen next month, chief medical officer Jennifer Russell announced this week. Guidelines will require pupils to wash their hands when entering or leaving gyms, and sports equipment for kids in K-8 classes will have to stay within class groupings.

Issues in focus

Generation gaps: For families that depend on grandparents for child care, school season has led to agonizing decisions about whether to isolate elderly relatives who are more vulnerable to COVID-19 from younger ones who risk spreading it. In Rosy Singh’s household in Vaughan, Ont., they’ve decided to teach eight-year-old Sukhamani at home so her grandmother, Paramjit Matharu, can be safer. “I don’t want to take that risk,” Ms. Singh said.

Funding gaps: Parents who would ordinarily fundraise for field trips are now helping schools buy plastic shields, air purifiers and other supplies. That worries educators who say the gulf between have- and have-not communities will widen unless governments do more. “This pandemic has highlighted all of the weak spots where vulnerable children are often left behind,” says Brandi Rai, president of the Alberta School Councils’ Association.

How do the provincial plans differ?

Key differences for students

Attendance: In Quebec - which has the strictest policies for in-class instruction - attendance is mandatory for all elementary and high-school students. The only exceptions occur if a class suffers an outbreak (in which case they’ll be sent home and continue studies there), a student has a doctor’s note saying they’re at high risk of COVID-19, or a student lives with a high-risk individual. Ontario, by contrast, requires school boards to provide remote-learning options for those who want them.

Ontario, by contrast, requires school boards to provide remote-learning options for those who want them. Masks: Masks will be mandatory in all classrooms in Ontario for grades 4 to 12. Manitoba and Alberta have restrictions for the same grades in any settings where physical distancing can’t be maintained; Calgary’s two main boards are going a step further, requiring masks for all grades, though not necessarily in classrooms. In Quebec, B.C., Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, governments have made masks for middle- and high-school grades in common areas like halls and buses, but not classrooms; the same is broadly true in Saskatchewan, though there it’s up to school boards, not a provincial mandate.

Cohorting: Most provinces will aim to have cohorts (B.C. calls them “learning groups”) to limit how many students come in contact with each other. In Quebec, Ontario and Alberta, the cohort is the class itself, though Ontario is also capping the size of high-school classrooms in high-risk areas to 15. B.C. allows the largest cohorts: 60 for elementary- and middle-school students, and 120 for high schoolers.

Key differences for teachers and staff

Masks: Mandatory mask policies will be more common for teachers and other school staff than for their pupils, but the rules aren’t consistent nationwide. They’ll be mandatory in many settings in Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador schools. In B.C. and Nova Scotia, masks are optional. In Prince Edward Island, gloves and face shields are strongly recommended if staff are interacting with students with complex medical needs.

Whose class is whose: To distribute teachers evenly among a larger number of smaller classes, each school will have to create a more complicated schedule than usual, which may involve rotating teachers between classes.

Indoors vs. outdoors: The federal COVID-19 guidance for schools encourages classes to be moved outside when the weather allows it, and jurisdictions like Nova Scotia plan to follow that advice. But thinking ahead to the winter, when outdoor instruction won’t be as easy, many school boards are pressing for ventilation upgrade that could reduce the airborne spread of the virus: Ontario has pledged $50-million for heating, ventilation and air conditioning improvements.

Transportation: In some provinces, the most complicated physical-distancing challenges fall to bus drivers, who will have to consider capacity limits (Quebec buses can have no more than 48 passengers) or fixed seating arrangements (Alberta pupils will have to stick to assigned seats). B.C. and Saskatchewan buses may have partitions for drivers. As for masks, they’re required for Manitoba’s bus drivers and encouraged in PEI but not necessarily required everywhere else.

Key differences for parents

Transportation: The Prairie provinces and PEI are strongly encouraging parents to take their children to school whenever possible, while in other jurisdictions, boards are adding new buses or walk-to-school programs to make physically distanced transportation easier.

Visiting: Some jurisdictions are limiting access to schools to staff and students only; parents may not be allowed to enter buildings. Instead, there will be designated outdoor pickup areas. Manitoba schools plan to have areas where students who report COVID-19 symptoms can be quarantined before pickup.

My child is going back to class. What can they do to get ready?

Learn how COVID-19 works

Because closing schools was one of the first steps taken in Canada and abroad when the pandemic was declared, little is known about how children contract or spread COVID-19. Children aren’t invulnerable to the virus, but the good news is that they make up far less of the infection toll than older people, and when they do get sick, their symptoms are often less severe. The bigger risk is that students with mild or absent symptoms will spread COVID-19 to teachers, family members or immunocompromised classmates who are more likely to get seriously ill. To prevent that, it’s essential that children know the COVID-19 symptoms (a dry cough, fever and difficulty breathing) and isolate themselves quickly if they’re not feeling well.

Talk about hygiene

Students at school will be expected to wash their hands a lot more often than usual, and may be given dedicated break times to do so. The video below demonstrates the federal government’s recommended practices for good hand-washing.

Talk about mental health

The pandemic has been a stressful time for everyone, including children who’ve been unable to see their friends or enjoy normal summer activities. But going back to school may give students new and more immediate anxieties to manage. Here are some pointers from the federal government on listening to your child’s concerns, and a mental-health hub for youth that includes various provincial crisis lines your child can contact if they’re in distress.

Help children stick to a routine

New school routines will be more regimented. They could include staggered lunch and recess breaks to avoid crowding, different lengths to the school day or an alternation between in-class and at-home learning on designated days of the week. Make sure that your child has a day planner or scheduling app and they keep it up to date.

Items to bring

The old standards: Pencils, pens, paper, scissors and other back-to-school staples are still as necessary as ever, even more so in schools with no-sharing policies to stop the spread of the virus on surfaces. Consider buying a washable pouch to store these items.

Consider buying a washable pouch to store these items. Computer: Some jurisdictions, like Nova Scotia, expect students to have their own computers that can be used for remote learning. If an outbreak sends the rest of the class home, this may be students’ only option for continuing lessons. If your child has a laptop or tablet, make sure they’re familiar with the software needed to stay in contact with their class; if they don’t, check with the school board to see if they provide computers or subsidies to buy one.

Non-medical mask: There are lots of homemade and brand-name masks options to choose from. The trick is finding one that’s the right size for your child and can be worn comfortably for long periods of time. Health reporter Wency Leung talked to medical experts who suggested four things to consider.

I don’t want my child back in class. What are my options?

Open this photo in gallery Students work on an assignment in a pandemic learning pod at home in Woodland Hills, Calif., on Aug. 12. Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images

Virtual studies or home-schooling are still an option in some provinces, notably Ontario, but every family’s situation is different. Ultimately, it’s a question of assessing risk: Is it better to send a child to school and be ready if they get sick, or to keep the child at home and disrupt your family’s working routine? Risk-assessment experts who spoke with The Globe caution that, in a new situation like a pandemic, gut feelings can be less reliable than the advice of experts. But “there’s no right answer as to how that trade-off should go. Everything depends on your own values,” says Paul Slovic, a psychology professor at the University of Oregon.

Some families, skeptical of their local back-to-school plans, have begun organizing “education pods” like those that emerged in the United States over the summer. The idea is to have families pool resources to hire a private teacher to instruct children in small groups. But many education advocates say pods will only segregate privileged families from racialized and low-income ones who will have to face the risks of public education alone. “Wealthy families have the resources to do whatever they want. It’s not a luxury for us parents who have four or five kids,” says Sureya Ibrahim, an Ethiopian-Canadian community organizer in Toronto’s Regent Park neighbourhood.

The death of Regis Korchinski-Paquet renewed calls for police accountability. A police watchdog announced today that it would not be laying charges against the officers present during her death. The Canadian Press

After a three-month investigation, Ontario’s police watchdog has concluded there are no reasonable grounds to lay criminal charges against any of the six Toronto Police officers who were present for the death of Regis Korchinski-Paquet.

Ms. Korchinski-Paquet, a 29-year-old Ukrainian-Afro-Indigenous woman, fell from the 24th floor balcony of her Toronto apartment on May 27, after police had been called to respond to a family disturbance, following a seizure that had left Ms. Korchinski-Paquet in distress.

The high-profile case has sparked protests against anti-Black racism and police conduct both in Toronto and across the country.

In his decision Wednesday, Joseph Martino, director of Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit — which probes all cases involving police that end in serious injury or death or allegations of sexual assault — acknowledged the “incredible public interest and attention” that the case has received, and noted that the SIU had notified Ms. Korchinski-Paquet’s family as well as the Toronto Police Service of their decision.

“First and foremost, it must be acknowledged that Ms. Korchinski-Paquet’s death, and others in recent months, has raised important issues of social consequence. On the heels of the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis, and the protest movement it has spawned across the United States, Canada and elsewhere, there is increased scrutiny of our society’s policing of members of the Indigenous and Black communities. Ms. Korchinski-Paquet was a member of both communities,” Mr. Martino wrote in his decision.

‘Regis’s legacy lives on:’ Walk and Public memorial for Regis Korchinski-Paquet

Former SIU director has seen evidence to support a criminal charge in death of Regis Korchinski-Paquet

“I accept that systemic racism exists and continues to challenge the relationship between racialized communities and the institutions of our justice system, just as it does in other sectors of society. Our leaders have acknowledged it, as have our laws.”

But he stressed that his unit’s mandate is a narrow one: to determine whether any of the officers committed a criminal offence in connection with her death.

“It was not to conduct a broad inquiry into systemic discrimination on the part of the police service,” he wrote. “There are other forums with the institutional mandates and expertise to conduct those inquiries.”

The report noted that six Toronto Police officers had been in and around Ms. Korchinski-Paquet’s apartment at the time of her death.

One of those officers, who had “the most dealings” with her, was investigated and interviewed as a subject officer. In addition to the other officers, 15 civilian witnesses including Ms. Korchinski-Paquet’s mother and brother, who were home at the time, as well as her father, whom Ms. Korchinski-Paquet had spoken with just moments before she fell, were also interviewed.

According to the SIU report, police were responding to multiple 911 calls about a domestic disturbance when they arrived at Ms. Korchinski-Paquet’s family’s apartment around 5:15 p.m. that evening.

One of those calls was made by Ms. Korchinski-Paquet herself, who reported that she’d been assaulted by her mother and brother, and that knives were involved. Her brother also called 911, saying that his sister had attacked him with knives. A third call was made by their mother, who said her daughter and son were fighting and that punches and bottles were thrown and she wanted them out.

The fight began after Ms. Korchinski-Paquet, who had epilepsy and had suffered seizures earlier in the day, had argued with her brother over the volume of the television in the living room.

When police arrived, they separated the siblings and their mother in the hallway. Ms. Korchinski-Paquet’s mother told police she wanted her daughter to be taken to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.

When Ms. Korchinski-Paquet said she had to go to the bathroom, she was escorted back into the apartment by a police officer.

She called her father from the bathroom.

When she came out, a police officer asked her to speak with a paramedic, given her seizure earlier in the day. She refused, and headed to the balcony. The police officer told her to come back inside, and attempted to open the door, but Ms. Korchinski-Paquet held it shut.

“Very quickly,” the report says, “Ms. Korchinski-Paquet scaled the balcony railing and the [police officer] lost sight of her. At about this time, [her mother] asked, “What is she doing?”

A police officer responded that she was “jumping balconies.”

Her mother and brother said that wasn’t possible, because the balcony is blocked off with mesh.

Two police officers went to knock on the apartment next door, but nobody answered. They returned, and when they looked down from Ms. Korchinski-Paquet’s balcony, saw that she had fallen to the ground below. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

In conclusion, Mr. Martino — who said his investigators looked both at whether police overstepped their authority, and whether they did enough — said the investigation did not warrant any criminal charges against any of the police officers involved.

Story continues below advertisement

While he said the investigation “turned up no indications of overt racism being brought to bear by any of the involved officers,” he added that “this is not to suggest that questions of race were entirely absent in the encounter.”

For example, he said that there was evidence that Mr. Korchinski-Paquet “attempted to court favour with the police at one point by informing them that her father was coming and he was “white”.

“The officers, it must be noted, indicated that they did not hear any such words,” Mr. Martino wrote.

“Needless to say, if true, the utterance is a testament to the importance of efforts to build and nurture trust in the relationship between the police and members of the Black and Indigenous communities.”

Ms. Korchinski-Paquet’s family and their lawyer are expected to respond to the report later today.

A white, 17-year-old police admirer was arrested Wednesday after two people were shot to death during a third straight night of protests in Kenosha over the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake.

Kyle Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, was taken into custody in Illinois on suspicion of first-degree intentional homicide. Antioch is about 15 miles from Kenosha.

Two people were killed Tuesday night and a third was wounded in an attack apparently carried out by a young white man who was caught on cellphone video opening fire in the middle of the street with a semi-automatic rifle.

Story continues below advertisement

“I just killed somebody,” the gunman could be heard saying at one point during the rampage that erupted just before midnight.

In the wake of the killings, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers authorized the sending of 500 members of the National Guard to Kenosha, doubling the number of troops. The governor’s office said he is working with other states to bring in additional National Guard members and law officers. Authorities also announced a 7 p.m. curfew, an hour earlier than the night before.

“A senseless tragedy like this cannot happen again,” the governor, a Democrat, said in a statement. “I again ask those who choose to exercise their First Amendment rights please do so peacefully and safely, as so many did last night. I also ask the individuals who are not there to exercise those rights to please stay home and let local first responders, law enforcement and members of the Wisconsin National Guard do their jobs.”

In Washington, the Justice Department said it is sending in the FBI and federal marshals in response to the unrest.

The dead were identified only as 26-year-old Silver Lake, Wisconsin, resident and a 36-year-old from Kenosha. The wounded person, a 36-year-old from West Allis, Wisconsin, was expected to survive, police said.

“We were all chanting `Black lives matter’ at the gas station and then we heard, boom, boom, and I told my friend, “That’s not fireworks,”' 19-year-old protester Devin Scott told the Chicago Tribune. “And then this guy with this huge gun runs by us in the middle of the street and people are yelling, `He shot someone! He shot someone!’ And everyone is trying to fight the guy, chasing him and then he started shooting again.”

Scott said he cradled a lifeless victim in his arms, and a woman started performing CPR, but “I don’t think he made it.”

According to witness accounts and video footage, police apparently let the young man responsible for the shootings walk past them with a rifle over his shoulder and his hands in the air as members of the crowd were yelling for him to be arrested because he had shot people.

As for how that happened, Sheriff David Beth portrayed a chaotic, high-stress scene, with screaming, chanting, nonstop radio traffic and “people running all over the place” – conditions that he said can cause “tunnel vision” among law officers.

Rittenhouse was assigned a public defender in Illinois for a hearing Friday on his transfer to Wisconsin. The public defender’s office had no comment. Under Wisconsin law, anyone 17 or older is treated as an adult in the criminal justice system.

Much of Rittenhouse’s Facebook page is devoted to praising law enforcement, with references to Blue Lives Matter, a movement that supports police. He also can be seen holding an assault rifle.

Other photographs include those of badges of various law enforcement agencies, including the Chicago Police Department. All of the badges have a black line across them – something police officers typically do with black tape when an officer is killed in the line of duty.

In a photograph posted by his mother, he is wearing what appears to be a blue law enforcement uniform as well as the kind of brimmed hat that state troopers wear.

The sheriff told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that armed vigilantes had been patrolling Kenosha’s streets in recent nights, but he did not know if the gunman was among them. However, video taken before the shooting shows police tossing bottled water from an armoured vehicle to what appear to be armed civilians walking the streets. And one of them appears to be the gunman.

“We appreciate you being here,” an officer is heard saying to the group over a loudspeaker.

The sheriff later defended officers by saying, “Our deputies would toss water to anybody.”

Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who is Black, said in an interview with the news program “Democracy Now!” that the shootings were not surprising and that white militias have been ignored for too long.

“How many times across this country do you see armed gunmen, protesting, walking into state Capitols, and everybody just thinks it’s OK?” Barnes said. “People treat that like it’s some kind of normal activity that people are walking around with assault rifles.”

In Wisconsin, it is legal for people 18 and over to openly carry a gun, with no license required.

Witness accounts and video indicate the shootings took place in two stages: The gunman first shot someone at a car lot, then jogged away, stumbled and fell in the street, and opened fire again as members of the crowd closed in him.

Authorities say two people were shot to death and another was wounded during a third night of protests in Kenosha over the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Video shot by Julio Rosas captured the sound of gunshots and people running for cover. The Associated Press

A witness, Julio Rosas, 24, said that when the gunman stumbled, “two people jumped onto him and there was a struggle for control of his rifle. At that point during the struggle, he just began to fire multiple rounds and that dispersed people near him.”

“The rifle was being jerked around in all directions while it was being fired,” Rosas said.

Sam Dirks, 22, from Milwaukee, said he had seen the suspected gunman earlier in the evening, and he was yelling at some of the protesters.

“He was definitely very agitated. He was pacing around, just pointing his gun in general. Not necessarily at anyone specifically,” Dirks said.

Blake, 29, was shot, apparently in the back, on Sunday as he leaned into his SUV, three of his children seated inside. Kenosha police have said little about what happened other than that they were responding to a domestic dispute. They have not said whether Blake was armed, and they have not disclosed the race of the three officers on the scene.

Story continues below advertisement

On Tuesday, Ben Crump, the lawyer for Blake’s family, said it would “take a miracle” for Blake to walk again. He called for the officer who opened fire to be arrested and for the others involved to lose their jobs.

The shooting was captured on cellphone video and ignited new protests in the U.S. three months after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer touched off a nationwide reckoning over racial injustice.

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden posted a video saying he had spoken with Blake’s parents and other family members.

“What I saw on that video makes me sick,” Biden said. “Once again, a Black man, Jacob Blake, has been shot by the police in broad daylight, with the whole world watching.”

The Black man shot in the back by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was left paralyzed and 'fighting for his life,' his family and lawyers said on Tuesday, as authorities in the lakefront town braced for a third night of civil unrest. Reuters

Lawyers for a Toronto police officer who was found guilty of assault in the beating of a young Black man are asking the court to throw out the conviction.

The legal team representing Const. Michael Theriault has filed an application to vacate the verdict, arguing the conviction for assault was not available to the court.

Theriault and his brother, Christian Theriault, were charged with aggravated assault and obstruction of justice in relation to a December 2016 incident that left Dafonte Miller with a ruptured eye and other serious injuries.

Story continues below advertisement

In a ruling delivered in June, Ontario Superior Court Justice Joseph Di Luca said he could not rule out the possibility that self-defence played a role in the early portion of the encounter.

It was during that period that Miller sustained the eye injury that warranted the aggravated assault charge, he said.

However, Di Luca said the self-defence argument collapsed when Theriault later armed himself with a roughly metre-long pipe and hit Miller in the head as the then-19-year-old was retreating.

As a result, Theriault was acquitted of aggravated assault but convicted of the lesser charge of assault.

The officer was also acquitted on the obstruction of justice charge, and his brother was cleared on all counts.

Theriault’s lawyers argue in court documents that assault was not listed as an option on the indictment and should not have been available for a guilty verdict.

Theriault was “never on notice” that he was being tried for “assaultive conduct” not connected to the eye injury, the document says.

“Given that there was no jurisdiction on this indictment to find the applicant guilty of an assault that was not charged and was not included in the counts on the indictment, it is appropriate for the court to grant this application and vacate the finding of guilt,” the application states.

The Crown is also challenging the verdict, which was delivered amid ongoing protests against systemic racism and calls to defund the police.

In a notice of appeal filed late last month, prosecutors allege Di Luca “erred in his analysis and assessment of the defence of self-defence.”

The case sparked multiple demonstrations, and many have denounced the ruling as further proof of anti-Black discrimination in law enforcement and the justice system.

Prosecutors alleged the Theriault brothers chased Miller in the early hours of Dec. 28, 2016, cornered him between two homes in Whitby, Ont., and beat him with a pipe because they wanted to deliver street justice.

The defence argued their clients caught Miller and his friends breaking into the Theriault family truck and wanted to arrest him. They said the two men found themselves fighting for their lives when Miller, who they said was armed with a pipe, attacked.

Di Luca flagged credibility issues with multiple witnesses, including the Theriault brothers and Miller. He found that Miller and his friends were stealing items from cars and that Michael Theriault’s initial intention was “likely not to arrest Mr. Miller, but rather to capture him and assault him.”

Miller was arrested by Durham regional police officers who arrived at the scene, though the charges against him were later dropped. The brothers were charged in the summer of 2017, months after the incident took place.

Toronto police said Wednesday that Theriault remains suspended with pay, and that any potential disciplinary action would take place once the court case is concluded.

Earlier this month, an independent review of the Toronto force’s handling of the incident found its former chief, Mark Saunders, breached the Police Services Act by not reporting the incident to the province’s police watchdog.

The report also found, however, that Saunders was kept in the dark about the incident for five months.

The force’s interim chief, James Ramer, issued an apology for the department’s decision not to immediately notify the Special Investigations Unit.

Miller dismissed the apology as a “public relations exercise,” and said in a statement that neither he nor his lawyers were notified of the review’s findings until minutes before their release.

Lorraine Whitman, president of the Native Women’s Association of Canada, said Wednesday it’s a relief the girl from We’koqma’q Mi’kmaq First Nation was found safe, but the case highlights a national problem.

She pointed to the report from the public inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, which highlighted a pattern of police categorizing missing girls as runaways, slowing down investigations.

Whitman says the “runaway” stereotype puts underage girls in danger and criteria for alerts should be reviewed to prevent the same delays from affecting another minor.

“They may have ran away, but we have to look at it more in depth,” she said in an interview. “We just can’t take it as a case that they wanted to leave. We have to look into it because there are more underlying areas that we have to investigate as well.”

The 2019 report on missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls cited testimony from families who “shared how stereotypes and victim blaming served to slow down or to impede investigations into their loved ones’ disappearances or deaths.”

“The assumptions tied to Indigenous women, girls … by police as ‘drunks,’ ‘runaways out partying,’ or ‘prostitutes unworthy of follow-up’ characterized many interactions, and contributed to an even greater loss of trust in the police and in related agencies,” the report said.

Whitman also took issue with the RCMP’s statement that the girl left willingly from her foster home with the man she knew. She said a 14-year-old can’t make that decision on her own, and suggested that if a non-Indigenous, wealthier child had been involved, the alert would have been sent right away.

Story continues below advertisement

“This is almost a week after this young girl has been missing, and in the woods,” Whitman said. “Our lives are very important as well. She was a minor and the RCMP had a due diligence that they had to follow.”

Video surveillance footage placed the 14-year-old and the man at a gas station in Catalone, N.S., on Aug. 13. Before she was found on Aug. 24, community members had been searching the area and pressuring police for more urgency in finding her and to issue an Amber Alert.

The We’koqma’q chief and council had offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to her whereabouts. Police issued a localized alert to residents east of the Mira River in Cape Breton a week after the girl ran away.

According to the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, Amber Alert programs are provincially operated and only the police can issue them. The criteria for issuing them vary, but the basic requirements include the disappearance of someone under the age of 18 who is suspected of being abducted.

RCMP Cpl. Lisa Croteau said Wednesday that information before the girl was found indicated she had not been abducted. New evidence, however, supports the child abduction charge, she said. Croteau said she could not go into specifics about the evidence because the case is before the courts.

But Croteau said police did not consider an Amber Alert necessary, because they did not believe the man was on the run with the child.

Story continues below advertisement

“From the onset of this investigation, we had strong evidence that they still were camping in the Cape Breton area and that they did not intend to leave the island,” Croteau said.

She cited ongoing talks with the provincial government about the general protocols for sending public alerts to Nova Scotia residents, adding that it’s not within the police’s power to change them.

Those consultations follow criticism that a provincewide emergency alert was not sent on April 18-19, during the manhunt for a killer who claimed 22 lives in the province. Police were chasing a gunman who was dressed as a Mountie during parts of his rampage.

When asked if the Nova Scotia RCMP detachment would take a closer look at how it approaches cases involving missing Indigenous kids, Croteau said the force treats all missing person cases seriously regardless of race.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday is announcing up to $2-billion for provinces and territories, called the Safe Return to Class Fund, to help pay for new learning spaces, air ventilation, hand sanitation and personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies. The Prime Minister is making the announcement at a school in north Toronto.

The federal government is also spending an additional $112-million for schools in First Nations.

“No parent should be losing sleep because they have to go back to work, but aren’t confident schools are properly prepared,” Mr. Trudeau said in prepared remarks.

The money, which will flow in two installments this fall and early next year, will be allocated based on the number of children aged four to 18 years old, with $2-million in base funding for each jurisdiction.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford and his Education Minister, Stephen Lecce, have faced criticism from school boards, educators and parents in recent weeks for their back-to-school plan. The government, critics say, has not provided enough funding to lower class sizes or provide sufficient health and safety measures. Some boards have been told to redo their plans weeks after getting the green light from the Ministry of Education.

Mr. Ford, however, has repeatedly defended his government's plan as the best in the country. The Ontario government has previously announced it is providing $309-million to school boards for cleaning, public health nurses, masks and other personal protective equipment.

Mr. Lecce has also said the government is “unlocking” $500-million from school boards’ reserves — money set aside to cover liabilities — that could be used to improve physical-distancing measures, such as smaller classes or leasing additional spaces. School boards have said only a portion of that money can be used to reopen schools safely.

It is unclear how provinces will use the money and even how quickly it can be put in place. Students in Quebec return to school later this week, and school boards in other parts of the country have been drawing up reopening plans with schools starting in a matter of weeks.

The Toronto District School Board, Canada’s largest school district, will use a combination of government funding, $29.5-million from its reserves and $2.9-million for elsewhere in its budget to lower class sizes in elementary schools, particularly in those communities hardest hit by COVID-19. The board recently said that kindergarten classes in COVID-19 hotspots would have no more than 15 children and other elementary grades would be at 20 students.

According to the federal government, Ontario will be allocated a maximum of $763.34 million; Quebec will receive $432.15 million; Alberta: $262.84 million; British Columbia: $242.36 million; Manitoba: $85.41 million; Saskatchewan: $74.9 million; Nova Scotia: $47.88 million; New Brunswick: $39.79 million; Newfoundland and Labrador: $26.18 million; Prince Edward Island: $10.39 million; Nunavut: $5.75 million; Northwest Territories: $4.85 million; Yukon: $4.16 million.

Ontario has released new guidance to parents and educators to help prevent and manage COVID-19 outbreaks in schools, including provisions that will not require ill students to take a test for the virus before returning to class.

Premier Doug Ford announced the new guidance on Wednesday, saying it had been developed by health-care experts to ensure a safe return of students to class next month.

The “playbook” gives instructions on what will happen if there is a COVID-19 outbreak in a school, and how school officials and the local public health unit will work to stop the spread of the illness.

“We have robust plans for schools and school boards so that when a case or an outbreak occurs everyone knows what to do so we can quickly find, isolate and contain the virus,” Ford said.

The new document from the government comes as school boards, teachers’ unions and some parents have expressed anxiety about the province’s reopening plan.

Those groups have called for smaller class sizes to encourage physical distancing at the elementary level. They want to hire more teachers and lease additional space to create new classrooms.

The new guidance does not lower class sizes but maps out what will be done if a student or staff display symptoms or tests positive for the virus, or there is an outbreak at a school.

The guidance also applies to the province’s child care centres and before and after school programs.

The plan emphasizes prevention, with parents asked to screen their children daily for COVID-19 symptoms and keep them home if any are discovered.

Teachers and principals will be asked to isolate any child that develops symptoms at school and send the child home when a parent can pick them up.

An ill child will not be allowed to return home on the school bus.

Public health officials will be given discretion to send entire cohorts of students home from school, or potentially close schools, if they feel that is the best way to manage an outbreak.

Schools will also be required to advise parents of any positive tests while not identifying the student. Schools must set up a COVID-19 advisory section on their websites and also possibly send letters home updating families.

“You will know very quickly if your child has come into contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19,” said Education Minister Stephen Lecce. “Parents, we know you have a tough choice to make. But know that if your child returns to school they will be safe.”

The province, however, will not make COVID-19 testing mandatory for students who have symptoms of the virus. Instead, the guidance says a child must be symptom free for 24 hours before they are allowed to return to school.

“Barriers to return to school, such as requirement of medical notes or proof of negative tests, should be avoided,” the guidance document says.

Ontario’s chief medical officer of health said parents may want their children tested, but ultimately it will be their decision in conjunction with the local health unit.

“Each case is different,” Dr. David Williams said. “Each case needs to be approached separately, respecting privacy, respecting where the situation is with the child and parent at that time.”

The president of the Ontario Public School Boards’ Association said boards across the province are still trying to absorb the guidance because they weren’t given the materials ahead of their release to the media on Wednesday.

“We’re just pleased to finally get this document because we’ve been hearing from parents and staff alike for the last two or three weeks,” Cathy Abraham said. “For parents, it means the difference between sending your kids to school or not.”

Abraham said what’s clear from her first look at the 21-page document is that boards will be leaning heavily on their local public health units for advice.

“The moment there is a situation where we feel like this is not adequate, we will be working with our public health units and making sure that we keep people safe,” she said.

The association that represents Ontario’s 43,000 doctors said Wednesday that the province’s medical officers of health will work closely with the government and schools to manage and minimize outbreaks and help prevent another “provincewide lockdown”.

“These strategies will not be a ‘one-size fits all’ approach; they will be tailored to the needs of the community,” the Ontario Medical Association said in a statement.

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the new guidance doesn’t go far enough.

“Parents have a right to be concerned the protocols released by the Ford government don’t do much to increase testing in the school community, or to actually ensure any staff member can stay home if they may be sick by mandating paid sick days any time they’re needed,” she said in a statement."

In an internal letter, Parliament’s independent law clerk says the thousands of pages of government documents released to MPs on the WE Charity controversy were excessively redacted by government officials.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Aug. 18 that the documents would be released, while also announcing that he was proroguing Parliament until Sept. 23.

The House of Commons finance committee had requested the documents as part of its investigation into the government’s since-abandoned plan to outsource the management of a student volunteer program to WE Charity. The program had an initial announced budget of $912-million but the contribution agreement with the charity was for $543.5-million.

Bill Morneau’s office, Kielburgers described as ‘besties’ in newly released documents

By choosing to prorogue immediately, rather than just before Parliament’s return, Mr. Trudeau’s decision shut down investigations by several committees into the WE Charity issue.

Philippe Dufresne, law clerk and parliamentary counsel for the House of Commons, wrote to finance committee clerk David Gagnon that same day to warn that the redactions did not respect the committee’s order.

“The departments made certain redactions to the documents on grounds that were not contemplated in the order of the committee,” Mr. Dufresne wrote in an Aug. 18 letter. “We note that the House’s and its committees’ power to order the production of records is absolute and unfettered as it constitutes a constitutional parliamentary privilege that supersedes statutory obligations, such as the exemptions found in the Access to Information Act.”

Mr. Dufresne’s letter was first reported by iPolitics. The Globe and Mail has also obtained a copy of the letter, which is not a public document.

The thousands of pages of highly redacted documents provide a window into the scramble inside government by cabinet ministers, their political staff and federal public servants in several government departments to hammer out the details of the Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG) program and the role WE Charity would play as a third-party provider.

The committee’s all-party motion called for the release of all contracts, briefing notes, e-mails and memos related to the design and creation of the student volunteer program. It said that matters of national security and cabinet confidences can be exempt and that the law clerk would make further redactions to protect the privacy of individual citizens and public servants.

In light of the law clerk’s letter, NDP MP and finance critic Peter Julian wrote to the committee clerk asking him to order the release of the documents in line with the committee’s initial request, but that did not happen. The committee’s website notes that all activity ceased with prorogation. It will be up to the membership of the finance committee to decide on its agenda once Parliament resumes.

Mr. Julian told The Globe that the government’s redactions, followed by prorogation, are outrageous and demonstrate the government’s contempt for parliamentary committees. Mr. Julian said if the documents back up the government’s assertions that WE’s involvement was recommended by the public service, then they should freely release all of the records.

“It’s the cover-up that is often more scandalous than the scandal and I think the government is getting perilously close to a cover-up on this,” Mr. Julian said.

Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre said Mr. Trudeau’s immediate prorogation prevents MPs from pushing for information.

“He’s covering up all kinds of key facts that would be material to our investigation and hoping to bury it all under a massive bonanza of tens of billions of dollars of new spending in the fall. I think he also wants to force an early election before any of these facts become public,” he said in an interview.

Liberal MP Wayne Easter, who chaired the finance committee at the time of prorogation, said Wednesday that he would be looking into the issue further.

“It sounds to me like some departments might have gone too far,” Mr. Easter said. ”The will of the committee should have been respected fully and the documents should be released as fully as possible.”

Pierre-Alain Bujold, a spokesperson for the Privy Council Office, defended the government’s redactions.

“Every effort was made to release as much information as possible to the committee, and indeed cabinet confidences pertaining to the [CSSG] program were disclosed, in keeping with public disclosures made by members of the Queen’s Privy Council,” he said in an e-mail Wednesday.

“A limited amount of information was protected for reasons including cabinet confidentiality (when it was unrelated to the CSSG), personal information and IT security.”

Former finance minister Bill Morneau’s office was so close to the co-founders of WE Charity that his department referred to them as “besties” and Mr. Morneau pushed hard to ensure the charity administered the government’s $543.5-million volunteer program, newly released documents reveal.

The documents include 5,000 pages of internal memos, e-mails and handwritten notes made by officials as they scrambled to put together the Canada Student Service Grant in April and May. The program was supposed to pay students up to $5,000 for volunteer work over the summer. The government expected as many as 100,000 students to participate and WE Charity was in line to receive up to $43.5-million to cover expenses for administering the program. The charity pulled out on July 3, weeks after the program was announced, amid a growing controversy over WE’s close ties to Mr. Morneau and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

How WE got here: A timeline of the charity, the contract and the controversy

Mr. Morneau, who resigned as finance minister this week, and Mr. Trudeau have apologized for not recusing themselves from a cabinet meeting on May 22 when the program was approved. It was announced on June 25. Mr. Morneau later revealed that he and his family had taken trips with WE to Kenya and Ecuador. He also confirmed that his two daughters had ties to WE. Last month, Mr. Morneau paid WE $41,000 to cover the cost of the trips. Mr. Trudeau’s family also has close ties to WE and his mother, Margaret Trudeau, received $312,000 for speaking at 28 WE events.

The documents were released by the House of Commons finance committee, which is investigating the volunteer program and the WE contract. However, on Tuesday Mr. Trudeau prorogued Parliament until Sept. 23, which will suspend the committee’s work.

Open this photo in gallery Rachel Wernick, a senior assistant deputy minister at Employment and Social Development Canada, which developed the volunteer program, held many weekend phone calls with Craig Kielburger.

The documents reveal that in early April, Craig Kielburger approached Mr. Morneau as well as Small Business Minister Mary Ng and Ms. Chagger about a $12-million Social Entrepreneurship Initiative that WE would run to encourage up to 8,000 young people to become engaged in voluntarism. Mr. Kielburger said the charity would leverage its network of corporate sponsors, including Royal Bank of Canada, Telus, KPMG and Microsoft, to provide mentorships. Participants would also take a course and receive a $500 grant to help set up a social enterprise along with a letter from Mr. Trudeau.

Officials contacted WE in late April to rework the idea so that it would fit into the national volunteer program the government was drafting at the time. On April 21, Mr. Morneau earmarked $900-million toward the volunteer program and approved WE’s social entrepreneurship venture. A few days later, his staff pressed officials at Employment and Social Development to pull the volunteer program together. Amitpal Singh, a policy adviser in the Department of Finance, said in an e-mail that Mr. Morneau was “concerned the government will drop the ball” on the idea.

The social enterprise venture was eventually dropped, but WE’s role in the volunteer program intensified despite indications the charity had run into financial issues. In an e-mail on May 23, WE’s executive director Dalal Al Waheidi told Ms. Wernick that the COVID-19 pandemic had significantly affected the charity and that it had to suspend its travel service, which operates tours to countries such as Kenya and India, and halt its annual WE Day events for 18 months. As a result, she said the charity had to “significantly reduce our staffing numbers.” Ms. Al Waheidi did not say how many jobs were cut and she insisted that WE would still be able to deliver the volunteer program. The documents don’t include any follow-up from Ms. Wernick or any indication that bureaucrats examined WE’s operations more closely.

During testimony to the finance committee last month, WE Charity’s former chair, Michelle Douglas, indicated that the organization was embroiled in turmoil in late March. Ms. Douglas said she was asked to resign on March 25 by Craig Kielburger after she raised concerns about more than 200 layoffs and expressed discomfort at the lack of financial transparency. Several other directors were replaced in April. Craig Kielburger has said the board was fully informed of the financial situation and that changes to the board had been planned.

Open this photo in gallery In an email to Marc Kielburger Wernick joked about him being late for a meeting because of a speaking engagement.

Officials also raised few questions about the WE Charity Foundation, which WE initially set up in 2019 to hold the organization's real estate assets. No assets were put into the foundation and it had no operations. It was repurposed for the volunteer program and the government contract to run the Student Service Grant was with the WE Charity Foundation, not WE Charity.

Sofia Marquez, who handled government relations at WE, told officials in an e-mail on May 26 that the foundation had been created to “receive, hold and disburse funds to other registered charities in the WE family for greater accounting ease and administrative simplicity.” The documents don’t indicate that there was any follow-up by government officials about why the contract was with the WE Charity Foundation.

Craig Kielburger told the finance committee last month that the foundation was used for the volunteer program to shield the charity from legal liability. Ms. Douglas told the committee that the board had “a number of concerns” about the foundation and did not understand its purpose.

WE Charity did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.

The documents show that some concerns were raised about the volunteer program. The charity Volunteer Canada refused to participate because it was “uncomfortable with the notion of providing a grant for volunteer work.” Some government officials also objected to one of WE’s volunteer proposals, which involved students writing and collecting recipes that were “easy to make” for seniors and front-line health care workers. The idea drew a rebuke from Ms. Wernick, who said in an e-mail to colleagues that it was “going to become the poster child of not being ‘quality’ – I have to say it doesn’t communicate well.”

Editor’s note: A previous version of this story said Craig Kielburger thanked Bill Morneau in an e-mail for a phone conversation about a volunteer program; in fact, the e-mail does not make clear that they discussed the program during that call.

Editor’s note: An earlier version of this story said documents revealed that Bill Morneau was so close to the co-founders of WE Charity that they were referred to as ""besties."" In fact, the documents refer to his office, not Mr. Morneau himself.

Moderna Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.-based biotech company that has secured a deal with Ottawa to provide its candidate COVID-19 vaccine to Canadians, has unveiled new data showing its vaccine has positive results among older adults.

The company presented its data Wednesday from its cohorts of older adult participants from its Phase 1 study at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s advisory committee on immunization practices. It found participants in two age groups, 56 to 70 and 71 and older, responded as well as younger adults, with similar levels of neutralizing antibodies.

“That is very big news. Usually in vaccines you lose neutralizing antibodies as you age because people have a weaker immune system” when they get older, Moderna chief executive officer Stéphane Bancel said in a phone interview, explaining the results have important implications for preventing COVID-19 among the elderly, who have high rates of mortality from the disease.

Moderna and Pfizer Inc. struck deals with the federal government this month to deliver their vaccines for distribution in Canada.

Moderna Inc said on Wednesday that an analysis of the early-stage data of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine showed it induced immune responses in older adults that were similar to younger participants. Reuters

Due to a confidentiality clause in its contract with Ottawa, Mr. Bancel said he was unable to provide any details of the deal, including the number of doses the company is expected to supply and the cost.

He said Moderna is planning to create a Canadian subsidiary, the details of which will be made available in the coming weeks, but the company said the Canadian supply will nonetheless be produced in Switzerland.

Still, having a Canadian subsidiary “will ensure that the Canadian population and the Canadian clinicians … have local teams on the ground who understand the culture, who understand the product,” and will be better able to provide support and customer service, he said.

In July, the New England Journal of Medicine published the results of the Phase 1 trial of the company’s vaccine among 45 young adults aged 18 to 55. The data released Wednesday for 10 participants aged 56 to 70 and 10 participants aged 71 and older was consistent with results from the younger group.

Moderna began Phase 2 of its trials in late May and Phase 3 in July. As of last week, it had recruited 14,000 of the 30,000 participants it needs for Phase 3 and is expected to complete enrolment in September. Mr. Bancel said the company is looking to recruit older adults as well as a diversity of participants, including Black and Hispanic individuals.

In the best-case scenario, the company could present data from Phase 3 as early as October; in the worst-case scenario, in December or January. Mr. Bancel said the timing depends on COVID-19 infection rates, as researchers must wait for participants to become naturally infected to determine how well the vaccine protects them compared with a placebo group.

Once this data is available, Mr. Bancel said, he anticipates the vaccine could receive emergency-use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – similar to that given to convalescent plasma this week as a treatment for COVID-19 – within days or weeks. That would likely allow high-risk populations, such as health care workers and older adults, to access the vaccine immediately.

Mr. Bancel said the company could provide the FDA with the necessary six months’ worth of safety data by the beginning of the year, so “you could see potentially an approval as early as January.”

For its supply agreements with other countries, he said the cost of the vaccine is about US$37 per dose for low volumes. With its agreement with the U.S. government, which has ordered 100 million doses, the cost is about US$22 per dose.

Matthew Oughton, an associate professor in the department of medicine at McGill University, said the latest results suggest the vaccine is so far performing as the company predicted based on its preclinical studies on animal models.

The purpose of a Phase 1 trial, however, is merely to begin to get a sense of the appropriate dose and the safety of the vaccine, Dr. Oughton said, emphasizing that only a very small number of participants were involved. “This is not at all the data you’re going to need to show widespread efficacy,” he said.

Editor’s note: Moderna said the Canadian supply of its vaccine will be produced in Switzerland. An earlier version of this story contained incorrect information.

Laura strengthened Wednesday into a menacing Category 4 hurricane, raising fears of a 20-foot storm surge that forecasters said would be “unsurvivable” and capable of sinking entire communities. Authorities implored coastal residents of Texas and Louisiana to evacuate and worried that not enough had fled.

The storm grew nearly 87% in power in just 24 hours to a size the National Hurricane Center called “extremely dangerous.” Drawing energy from the warm Gulf of Mexico waters, the system was on track to arrive late Wednesday or early Thursday as the most powerful hurricane to strike the U.S. so far this year.

“It looks like it’s in full beast mode, which is not what you want to see if you’re in its way,” University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy said.

Winds were expected to reach 150 mph (241 kph) before landfall, and forecasters said up to 15 inches of rain could fall in some places.

One major Louisiana highway already had standing water as Laura’s outer bands moved ashore with tropical storm-force winds. Thousands of sandbags lined roadways in tiny Lafitte, and winds picked up as shoppers rushed into a grocery store in low-lying Delcambre. Trent Savoie, 31, said he was staying put.

“With four kids and 100 farm animals, it’s just hard to move out,” he said.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards fretted that the dire predictions were not resonating despite authorities putting more than 500,000 coastal residents under mandatory evacuation orders.

In Lake Charles, Louisiana, National Guard members drove school buses around neighbourhoods, offering to pick up families. Across the state line in Port Arthur, Texas, few stragglers boarded evacuation buses, and city officials announced that two C-130 transport planes offered the last chance to leave.

Abbott warned that people who fail to get out of harm’s way could be cut off from help long after the storm hits.

A Category 4 hurricane can cause damage so catastrophic that power outages may last for months in places, and wide areas could be uninhabitable for weeks or months. The threat of such devastation posed a new disaster-relief challenge for a government already straining to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Among the parts of Louisiana that were under evacuation orders were areas turning up high rates of positive COVID-19 tests.

The National Hurricane Center kept raising its estimate of Laura’s storm surge, from 10 feet just a couple of days ago to twice that size – a height that forecasters said would be especially deadly.

By Wednesday afternoon, Laura had maximum sustained winds of 145 mph (233 kph) as it churned about 155 miles (250 kilometres) south of Lake Charles.

“Heed the advice of your local authorities. If they tell you to go, go! Your life depends on it today,” said Joel Cline, tropical program co-ordinator at the National Weather Service. “It’s a serious day and you need to listen to them.”

On Twitter, President Donald Trump also urged coastal residents to heed local officials. Hurricane warnings were issued from San Luis Pass, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, and reached inland for 200 miles (322 kilometres). Storm surge warnings were in effect from Freeport, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River.

For some, the decision to leave home left them with no place to stay. Wary of opening mass shelters during a pandemic, Texas officials instead put evacuees in hotels, but Austin stopped taking arrivals before dawn because officials said they ran out of rooms. Other evacuees called the state’s 211 information line and were directed to Ennis, outside Dallas, only to be told after driving hundreds of miles that there were no hotels available or vouchers.

Taniquia Ned and her sisters showed up without money to rent a room, saying the family had burned through its savings after losing jobs because of the coronavirus. “The COVID-19 is just totally wiping us out,” said Shalonda Joseph, 43, a teacher in Port Arthur.

Edwards lamented that the impending storm meant suspension of community testing for COVID-19 at a crucial time – as elementary and secondary schools in Louisiana are opening and students are returning to college campuses. “We’re basically going to be blind for this week,” Edwards said, referring to the lack of testing.

Forecasters said storm surge topped by waves could submerge entire towns. Water was already rising in the small Louisiana community of Holly Beach in the imperiled Cameron Parish, which forecasters have warned could become part of the Gulf of Mexico after the storm comes ashore.

Laura is expected to cause widespread flash flooding in states far from the coast. Flood watches were issued for much of Arkansas, and forecasters said heavy rainfall could arrive by Friday in parts of Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky. Laura is so powerful that it’s expected to become a tropical storm again once it reaches the Atlantic Ocean, potentially threatening the Northeast.

Becky Clements, 56, evacuated from Lake Charles after hearing that it could take a direct hit. She and her family found an AirBnb hundreds of miles inland. Almost 15 years have passed since Hurricane Rita destroyed the city.

“The devastation afterward in our town and that whole corner of the state was just awful,” Clements recalled. “Whole communities were washed away, never to exist again. … So knowing how devastating the storms are, there was no way we were going to stay for this.”

The church educator said she fears for her office, which is in a trailer following recent construction.

“I very much anticipate that my office will be gone when I get back. It will be scattered throughout that field.”

The hurricane also threatens a centre of the U.S. energy industry. The government said 84% of Gulf oil production and an estimated 61% of natural gas production were shut down. Nearly 300 platforms have been evacuated. Consumers are unlikely to see big price hikes however, because the pandemic has decimated demand for fuel.

“If Laura moves further west toward Houston, there will be a much bigger gasoline supply problem,” Oil analyst Andrew Lipow said, since refineries usually take two to three weeks to resume full operations.

Laura closed in on the U.S. after killing nearly two dozen people on the island of Hispaniola, including 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.

Vice President Mike Pence was set to make an economic pitch to re-elect President Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday while his boss waded into the latest flare-up of unrest over the police shooting of a Black man.

The convention’s first two nights featured grim claims about how the United States would suffer if Trump loses in November to Democrat Joe Biden, who is leading in national opinion polls. On Wednesday Trump weighed in on protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where three people were shot, two fatally, on the third night of unrest there. A 17-year-old was arrested on homicide charges.

Trump posted on Twitter that he was sending federal law enforcement and the National Guard, with the agreement of Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers. “We will NOT stand for looting, arson, violence, and lawlessness on American streets,” Trump wrote.

RNC 2020: Defying precedent and possibly law, Mike Pompeo dives into presidential race with speech supporting Trump

Officials said the suspect appeared to be linked to a vigilante militia-style group who had asked the local sheriff to deputize them as protest responders, which he refused.

Biden said he spoke with the family of the Black man, Jacob Blake, 29, who was badly wounded when police shot him four times in the back at close range. The former vice president called for justice for the Blake family and for an end to violence.

“Protesting brutality is a right and absolutely necessary, but burning down communities is not protest. It’s needless violence,” Biden said in a video posted to his campaign’s social media accounts. “The wisest words that I’ve heard spoken so far have come from Julia Jackson, Jacob’s mother. She looked at the damage done in her community and she said ‘this doesn’t reflect my son or my family.’”

PENCE’S PITCH

Pence, who will be renominated as Trump’s running mate after on-and-off speculation he would be dropped from the ticket, is expected to highlight the administration’s record as well as goals for a second term.

The former Indiana governor and congressman, a conservative Christian, served as a key connector between Trump and evangelical voters, a powerful and influential part of the Republican political base.

But he has also become, along with Trump, the face of the White House response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 177,000 people in the United States and put tens of millions of Americans out of work. Pence leads the White House coronavirus task force.

Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Pence had “pulled his punch” in confronting the virus and became “a figure in the background” after being appointed to lead the task force.

Story continues below advertisement

“They were slow in anticipation and, not only that, reacting to what was happening out there in terms of the spread of the virus,” Pelosi said in a video news briefing on Wednesday.

A White House official said Pence would offer an optimistic vision for the country while also providing a contrast with Biden and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris. At their own party convention last week, Biden and Harris warned Americans against giving Trump another four years in the White House.

Despite the promise of an upbeat message, the Republican gathering’s first two days were peppered with ominous predictions of a wave of radical socialism and chaos if Democrats won the White House.

Republicans are hoping Trump will get a boost in the polls from a convention that is highlighting his re-election themes, including a tough “law and order” message.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken Aug. 19-25 showed Biden had not seen a bounce in popular support from his party’s convention last week, but maintains a 7-percentage-point lead over Trump nationally.

HATCH ACT CONCERNS

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised Trump’s foreign policy record in a video address from Jerusalem, drawing criticism from Democrats and former officials for breaking with protocol by using his appointed office for partisan purposes.

Story continues below advertisement

The Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s oversight subcommittee announced an investigation into whether Pompeo’s appearance breached regulations or the 1939 Hatch Act, which limits political activities by federal employees.

White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told Politico in a video interview on Wednesday that Pompeo was speaking in a personal capacity and used no federal assets in delivering the speech.

Tuesday night’s convention program also included a citizenship naturalization ceremony at the White House, overseen by the acting secretary of homeland security, and a presidential pardon, raising concerns the apparatus of the federal government was being harnessed for Trump’s re-election campaign.

A White House official said the naturalization ceremony and pardon were official White House events. The footage was posted on a public website ahead of the convention broadcast and the campaign was free to use that content, the official said.

Pence plans to speak from Baltimore’s Fort McHenry, the inspiration for the U.S. national anthem “The Star-Spangled Banner,” a national monument under federal control.

The Maryland site allows space for an outdoor live audience. Both parties’ conventions have been dramatically scaled back, taking place mostly virtually and without large live audiences to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

Other speakers scheduled on Wednesday include second lady Karen Pence, Senators Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Joni Ernst of Iowa, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, and Kellyanne Conway, who announced earlier this week that she would be stepping down as a White House adviser.

Alongside a dirt road in Muscowpetung Saulteaux Nation, community members drive up with lawn chairs in tow to sit outside a fenced-in enclosure and watch a herd of 15 bison gnaw on the prairie grass.

“Oh my God, they love it. They’re visiting them every evening,” James Pratt said about the excitement over the bison’s return to the Saulteaux community, nestled among the rolling Qu’Appelle valleys in Treaty 4 territory northeast of Regina.

Mr. Pratt is a community helper in Muscowpetung and part of a team that worked to bring back the stately creatures that once roamed the Saskatchewan prairies. The herd was initially bought to bolster food security during the pandemic, but the animals are providing the community with more than a stockpile of meat. They’re reconnecting community members with their past and revitalizing their culture. “At one point, these animals were just about wiped out and now … in the last probably 20-30 years, they’re starting to make a comeback, they’re starting to come into our territory,” Mr. Pratt said.

It’s estimated that more than 30 million wood bison and plains bison roamed the Great Plains of North America before the late 1800s, when their population was drastically reduced as lands were colonized and developed with treaties between Canada and First Nations.

Prior to their near-extinction, bison – sometimes also called buffalo – were a significant part of First Nations culture that has long revered the stately creatures as sacred with important gifts and teachings. “This animal has fed us, this animal has clothed us, this animal has taught us and this animal has basically been there for all of us,” Mr. Pratt said.

The Muscowpetung Bison Farm is now planning a four-year project to grow and manage a herd permanently to move beyond a pandemic stopgap measure.

“We didn’t realize the strength [the herd] would bring to our community,” Saulteaux Nation Chief Melissa Tavita said, adding the return of the bison was also the vision of a late elder. “We’re going back to our roots and going back to our traditional ways.”

In preparation for the bisons’ arrival in July, Muscowpetung consulted with elders and knowledge keepers to ensure they followed traditional Saulteaux teachings and customs.

The herd was welcomed with a feast and pipe ceremony when they arrived from Alberta, and were released into an enclosure, where they will roam and graze until they are harvested for food in the event of a community lockdown that restricts access in and out of Muscowpetung.

“But for each time we slaughter a buffalo, there has to be some sort of ceremony done to that as well,” Chief Tavita said.

Open this photo in gallery The Muscowpetung farm is planning a four-year project to manage a herd of bison permanently.

Ron Steckly is the rancher from Carstairs, Alta., who sold the herd of his wood-plains-cross bison to Muscowpetung, the fourth First Nation to receive his bison.

Mr. Steckly grew up on a dairy farm in Alberta but took up cattle instead. He bought his first bison in the late 1990s, but says he wasn’t making any money off them and had in fact sold most of his bulls and heifers to offset costs of keeping them. So when he was approached by a Samoan Christian group in Saskatchewan about donating a herd to Peepeekisis First Nation, not far from Muscowpetung, who wanted to revitalize the population for its cultural significance, he gave them 20 cows and two bulls at no cost.

Last winter, Peepeekisis had enough in their herd to move some cows and bulls to another First Nation that has also welcomed the bison back onto their territory.

Mr. Steckly will work out a similar agreement with Muscowpetung to deliver another herd this winter at no cost.

The rancher said the bison program has led to new friendships and teachings. He initially had no idea how much bison meant to First Nations people’s identities.

“It is really something to experience when you drive into and you arrive at the destination where they’re going to be unloaded and there are people and more people and cars, and they’re all waiting and they all want to see the buffalo and they are excited about it and they’re emotional about it,” Mr. Steckly said from his ranch, where he has around 400 bison.

Open this photo in gallery The bison at Muscowpetung came from rancher Ron Steckly, who has supplied the animals to other First Nations.

Mr. Pratt says bringing the bison back onto their territory is a teaching – from the elders for the young people and future generations – that, like the bison, First Nations are survivors of colonialism.

“As First Nations, I guess they tried to do away with us too in history,” he said about Canada’s relationship with Indigenous people.

Kevin Wesaquate calls the reintroduction of bison a movement to preserve a cultural identity that carries sacred teachings and stories that are hard to find.

Mr. Wesaquate, whose art and poetry often includes bison, is a Cree artist and poet from Piapot First Nation, next to Muscowpetung. He says Indigenous identity is connected to the ability to practise old customs, traditions and ceremonies that are coming back to First Nations.

“At one point, the Indigenous people had to hide away those ceremonies. So they would take like, for instance, the Thirst Dance or the Sun Dance and they would practise those ceremonies within the bushes, deep in the bushes, and hide those ceremonies from people,” the artist said from Saskatoon, where he’s lived for 35 years.

“[The bison] provide that sense of belonging, that sense of Indigenous pride that so many people crave,” he said.

Open this photo in gallery Saulteaux Nation Chief Melissa Tavita says the herd has brought strength to the community.

Chief Tavita said the recent months have been stressful on the community, not just with COVID-19 but other events, such as a band election, which can divide members.

Seeing the bison helped the community feel that “we’re moving forward in a good way,” she said. “They really appreciated that there’s something to look forward to.”

The community with 500 on-reserve members and 1,600 off-reserve members was in lockdown in April and part of May, but restrictions limiting people going in and out of the community have since eased. There have been no reported cases of the novel coronavirus in the community. But restrictions could be reintroduced, depending on the number of cases in the region.

Saskatchewan has reported about 1,600 COVID-19 cases, while Indigenous Services Canada says they’re aware of 92 cases on reserves in the province.

“When we can’t go off-reserve, that’s when we’ll harvest the buffalo,” Chief Tavita said.

Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien says he is feeling “100 per cent” after undergoing a heart procedure during the Stanley Cup playoffs.

Julien had a stent installed in a coronary artery Aug. 13 at St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto after complaining of chest pains.

The procedure came a day after Montreal opened its first-round playoff series with the Philadelphia Flyers at Scotiabank Arena.

“To be honest with you it really felt like it was heartburn, so after a while when it didn’t want to go away, I just reached out to Graham [Rynbend], our medical trainer, and just told him about it,” Julien said Wednesday on a teleconference with reporters.

“After talking with him we decided it was safer to head over to the hospital and get checked out a little closer. In doing that, they found one of my arteries was partially blocked, and that they needed to put in a stent. That got done right away, and I couldn’t have asked for better care at St. Michael’s Hospital. They were awesome.”

Julien said he didn’t suffer a heart attack and was ready to return to work had the Canadiens defeated the Flyers and advanced to the second round of the playoffs. Montreal pushed heavily favoured Philadelphia to six games before their impressive run in Toronto came to an end.

“Came back to Montreal just to rest, and had we won Game 6 Friday night, I was on my way back to Toronto for that day quarantine and would have been definitely ready for the next round,” Julien said.

Associate coach Kirk Muller took over behind the bench in Julien’s absence. The 60-year-old Julien said Muller did a great job in charge and stuck with the formula that led to the Canadiens’ four-game upset of Pittsburgh in a best-of-five preliminary-round series.

Julien said he talked with Muller daily during the Philadelphia series, but didn’t try to impose his style on the other Montreal coaches while he was away.

“Putting myself in his shoes, I wouldn’t want to be told how to coach. So Kirk coached the way he thought was the best way to coach,” Julien said.

“There was no doubt in my mind that they were going to do a good job behind the bench, so kudos to them.”

Julien said he doesn’t expect his lifestyle to change too much after the procedure, outside of some adjustments to his nutrition and exercise regimens.

“I’ve had some chats with other coaches in the league that have had that situation done to them, and they’re still behind the bench doing their work,” he said. “I’m 100-per-cent recovered right now, and there’s no reason why I shouldn’t be able to go back to work.”

Julien said his family is supportive of his decision to get back behind the bench.

“I don’t think I would ever put myself in jeopardy of risking my life to do something that I love doing, just because I want to do it,” he said. “I think there’s been a lot of thought and there’s been a lot of discussions around whether I go back or not.”"

THOMAS PETER/Reuters

One of China’s leading vaccine developers is blaming domestic bureaucratic indecision for the delays in shipping supplies to Canada for a joint testing program that has now been abandoned.

Some divisions of the Chinese government were not clear on whether the vaccine should “go to global trials or how to handle it,” said Dr. Xuefeng Yu, the chairman and CEO of CanSino Biologics, which in May agreed to bring its Ad5-nCoV vaccine candidate to Canada for testing through a partnership with the National Research Council (NRC).

The agreement stood as a rare sign of co-operation between Ottawa and Beijing in the midst of the legal and diplomatic frictions that have soured relations between the two countries.

But the deal has instead created further problems, after Chinese officials refused to ship the vaccine to Canada. They have allowed other Chinese vaccine candidates to be shipped to other countries for wide-scale testing.

In contrast, the shipment of Ad5-nCoV to Canada was so badly delayed that the planned testing will not proceed, Dr. Yu told The Globe and Mail in an interview Tuesday. Decisions in China on whether to send it to Canada were “caught in the bureaucracy,” he said. Now the time to do those trials has “already passed,” with the company reporting results of its second-phase trials in July.

The Ad5-nCoV trials were expected to be completed by the Canadian Center for Vaccinology at Dalhousie University. That centre “was ready to start clinical trials as early as June, after Health Canada’s review and approval of the CanSino clinical trial proposal,” the NRC said in a statement. It said the Chinese government changed the process for shipping vaccines out of the country subsequent to the signing of the NRC’s agreement with CanSino.

“Due to the delay in the shipment of the vaccine doses to Canada, the NRC has since moved on to focus our team and facilities on other partners and COVID-19 priorities,” the statement said.

The failure of the vaccine partnership with CanSino comes in the midst of continued tensions between Canada and China, following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at the Vancouver airport, and the subsequent arrests of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in China.

It’s not clear what effect, if any, that broader dispute had on CanSino’s agreement with Canada. Dr. Yu said he “cannot comment too much about politics.” In July, the office of Innovation, Science and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains cited delays at China Customs. Dr. Yu said he did not know where the problem arose, except that government decision-making around vaccine research in China is “too complicated.”

The development underscores the risk that Canada faces when working with international partners at a time when virtually every country is looking to secure a COVID-19 vaccine for its population.

Story continues below advertisement

Worldwide, nearly 50 vaccines aimed at COVID-19 are now being tested in humans, though only a handful of those have progressed to large-scale trials. Earlier this month, Ottawa announced deals with two of the international front-runners, Moderna and Pfizer Inc, to secure millions of doses of their vaccines for use in Canada next year.

Ad5-nCoV is being jointly developed with the Chinese military but relies on a piece of Canadian technology, a cell line modified by the NRC. The NRC provided that cell line to CanSino in 2014, which the company then used to develop a vaccine for Ebola before pivoting to COVID-19 earlier this year. The licence to use the cell line is non-exclusive use, meaning Canada has no claim to revenue from the coronavirus vaccine if it proves successful.

As part of the agreement to stage the trial in Canada, the NRC would have been allowed to produce the vaccine domestically at a facility in Montreal for testing and emergency use.

The collapse of the trial eliminates that possibility, and Canadian officials said they are now focusing on working with other partners including VBI Vaccines, a Massachusetts-based company with research operations in Ottawa, and Saskatoon’s infectious disease laboratory VIDO-Intervac.

“It’s evident that the opportunity [with CanSino] is over,” said NRC president Iain Stewart.

CanSino completed its first and second-phase trials in China. Its second-phase results showed antibodies for the novel coronavirus in 85 per cent of participants, but also found adverse reactions in nearly three-quarters of those in the study group.

CanSino is now planning for international third-phase tests, which typically involve thousands or tens of thousands of participants. The company has announced partnerships for such testing in Russia and Saudi Arabia, and is also looking to South America and East Africa – all places with what Dr. Yu described as a “high disease burden.” Third-phase tests compare large numbers of people injected with a vaccine candidate to people injected with a placebo. None of the proposed countries, however, boasts a pharmaceutical-testing process as rigorous or transparent as that in Canada.

And Canada is “not an ideal place to run phase three,” Dr. Yu said, citing the comparatively small number of COVID-19 cases in Canada.

He expressed confidence that “our vaccine should work, and it’s just a matter of time – how quickly we can evaluate in the large-scale phase-three clinical trial.”

In the global race to develop a pharmaceutical defence against COVID-19, Russia claimed the first success, approving a vaccine that has yet to complete full testing.

China, too, has moved quickly to assert itself as a leader. Chinese authorities issued a patent for the CanSino virus earlier this month. In June, the company also revealed that China’s Central Military Commission has granted the vaccine a one-year approval for military use.

Sinopharm, another Chinese state-owned firm, has given wide distribution to its own vaccine candidate, using phase-three trials to provide shots to a wide selection of elites. That includes upper management at state-owned enterprises, as well as large numbers of people at some government ministries, some of whom are using the option to volunteer in hopes of securing early immunity. Sinopharm is also testing the vaccine in Argentina, the United Arab Emirates, Peru, Morocco and Bahrain. The company has said it expects its vaccine, which consists of inactivated coronavirus, to be commercially available before the end of the year.

The Ad5-nCoV vaccine candidate uses another type of virus known as an adenovirus to deliver genetic instructions for making those proteins directly inside human cells, rather than inducing an immune response by injecting an individual with coronavirus proteins. At least two other front-runner COVID-19 vaccines – one developed by Oxford University and another by the pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson – are using the same strategy.

The Canadian trial, based in Halifax, was to have been a combination phase-one and phase-two trial involving up to 696 participants. Researchers organizing the trial had hoped to recruit participants up to 85 years in age in order to better assess the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in the oldest members of the Canadian population – the group that is most vulnerable to COVID-19.

With CanSino now off the table, the only COVID-19 vaccine trial currently underway in Canada is one led by Quebec-based Medicago. IMV Ltd., a Nova Scotia-based biotech company, and VIDO-Intervac both have plans to launch early phase trials of their COVID-19 vaccine candidates in Canada later this year.

In a separate development, DIOSynVax, a company led by Cambridge University immunologist Jonathan Heeney, who is Canadian, announced on Tuesday that it has funding to run a phase-one clinical trial of its vaccine in Britain later this year. The company is also in discussion with collaborators at McMaster University in Hamilton, who have expertise in setting up larger-scale international vaccine trials.

There is no province in Canada that has done a perfect job of limiting the spread of the COVID-19 virus. But there is one province that stands out as having done the least perfect job of all, and that is Quebec.

As of Tuesday, Quebec had recorded 724 confirmed cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 people. The national average is 332 per 100,000. The province with the next highest rate, Alberta, stood at 295 on Tuesday.

The same gaps exist in the number of deaths per capita. Quebec has had 67 deaths per 100,000 people – one of the highest death rates in the world, and well above Italy, Spain or the United States. The next highest province, Ontario, is at 19 deaths per 100,000.

It may not be entirely fair to compare across jurisdictions, but Quebec Premier François Legault has invited such scrutiny by resorting to divisive tactics to distract from the painful reality of the crisis in his province.

Last week, he once again accused the veteran health reporter at The Gazette, Montreal’s English-language daily newspaper, of being biased. It was the third time he has claimed that Aaron Derfel is trying to undermine his government with false reporting.

The Premier also said that, if anglophones in Quebec are more worried about catching COVID-19 than francophones, as at least one poll suggests, it must be because they are spending their time reading Mr. Derfel’s tweets and watching CNN and other American news channels.

Attacking journalists and taking cheap shots at a minority group is no way to address a crisis that has claimed the lives of more than 5,700 Quebeckers. Columnists in the province’s French-language newspapers have rightfully pilloried Mr. Legault for trying to shoot the messenger.

Mr. Legault’s tactic has backfired in another way, too, by shining a spotlight on his government’s handling of the crisis. It’s fair to say the Premier has not had a good pandemic.

Not that it’s entirely his government’s fault. Quebec had the misfortune of scheduling its annual school spring break in late February, a week ahead of the rest of the country. Many Quebeckers holidayed in the United States and Europe just as the pandemic was picking up steam. Some experts believe Quebec’s early spike in cases was mostly bad luck.

But the curve of new cases continued to climb after lockdown was imposed in March. And Quebec’s outbreaks in long-term care homes were bigger, longer and deadlier than anywhere else in Canada.

Story continues below advertisement

The government’s most glaring misstep occurred on June 24, a provincial holiday, when Quebec’s public-health agency announced it would no longer release data about new cases and deaths on a daily basis – a practice common around the world – and would instead only make them public once a week.

The surprise decision came after Horacio Arruda, Quebec’s chief public-health officer, attended a provincial cabinet meeting at which the issue was discussed, raising concerns that Dr. Arruda had yielded to demands from the Legault government.

Dr. Arruda denied there was any political interference. But three days later, after much criticism from epidemiologists and francophone commentators, the decision was reversed.

In the midst of all that, Mr. Legault demoted his health minister, Danielle McCann, and replaced her with Treasury Board president Christian Dubé.

Firing your lead minister in the middle of a major crisis is never a good look, but Mr. Legault was reportedly fed up with the endless bad news battering his government.

The government has also come under fire for reopening bars in late June, causing a fresh spike in cases, and for raising the maximum number of people at an indoor public gathering to 250 from 50 as of Aug. 3, a move that has backfired in European countries and many American states.

Story continues below advertisement

This week it’s the government’s back-to-school plan that is drawing fire. Unlike most other provinces, Quebec students will not have to wear masks or physically distance in classrooms. And parents will not have the option of keeping their children at home to learn remotely, unless they provide a “valid medical note.”

Mr. Legault is not the only premier facing tough questions about their handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. But he’s the only one trying to make a farce of this tragedy, by blaming a reporter for reporting the news.

If we’re going to get historical about it, the sports animus between Toronto and Boston reaches back to 1933 – the Ace Bailey incident. Then it ends.

If the Maple Leafs’ are a quasi-religion in this town, Bailey is their John the Baptist. During a game in Boston, he was cold-cocked from behind by the Bruins’ Eddie Shore. Bailey hit the ice head first and cracked his skull. His injuries were such that the Leafs reportedly made arrangements to have his body returned to Canada.

In the froth that followed, Bailey’s father got on a train in Toronto with a pistol in his jacket pocket. He told everyone he met that when he got to Boston, he was going to kill Shore. Leafs’ assistant general manager Frank Selke called ahead and had Boston PD meet Mr. Bailey at the station.

It went on like that for a few days, calls back and forth between the cities for decisive action against enemy aggression. At another point, police prepared a manslaughter charge against Shore.

In the end, it went the way hockey fights play out in masculine fantasies – with Bailey recovered, Shore chagrined and the pair shaking hands in front of a full house. More than victory, what people crave from sports are tales of redemption. This one rang all the bells.

But it can’t be said to have ended fairly. Shore had arguably the greatest pre-war NHL career. Bailey, only 30 at the time, never played again.

After that hot start, angry festivities between the cities cooled. The Leafs became the dominant NHL force in the ’40s. The Red Sox had no Toronto team to beat up on.

It continued on like that for decades. If one was up, the other was either down or absent altogether. That latter explains the last couple of times the Bruins and Leafs have met in the playoffs.

In retrospect, it seems odd the two towns intersected so rarely. They came up the same way – working-class second cities, Catholic in that puritanical way, fixated on what their sports teams say about them.

New York can exist without the Yankees. London would be fine without Arsenal or Spurs. Paris doesn’t have a team anyone in Paris cares about.

But there can be no Boston without Fenway, and Torontonians would have nothing to yell at each other about in bars if it weren’t for the Leafs. More or less, sports glues the two places together.

Wherever you happen to be from, it is fashionable to hate Boston. The city wins a lot, and the citizens are not quiet about it. Whenever you think of Boston, you think of that perfected Bostonian transplant – Tom Brady – loading up one hand with Super Bowl rings and flashing his dead-eyed smile at a camera.

Boston is collectively that guy. That guy your friend brought along on a night out who wouldn’t shut up about his job and kept hitting on the waitress. That guy who made a point of giving you his card and insisting you “reach out.” That guy you hope to never, ever see again, much less be trapped with for three hours.

Toronto is also that guy, but isn’t so obvious about it. Maybe if the city averaged a major championship every year or so, it would be.

All this to say, these two places were meant to butt up against each other in some dramatic way. Let’s hope Raptors vs. Celtics is the beginning of that.

Thus far, the Raptors have no natural enemies in the wild. The team spent so much of its history being terrible, that it has no history to speak of.

Story continues below advertisement

It’s time to start making some. I suppose Philadelphia has potential. It does like a fight. Milwaukee is in the same talent bracket. New York would be good if New York was good, and it is not.

But you are not going to waste your time hating Milwaukee when the closest you could come to pinpointing Wisconsin on a map is “somewhere in the middle.”

Boston comes prepackaged as a hate object. Success? Check. Insufferable constant referencing of that success? Check. Vague familiarity with the cultural touchstones of the place? (Dropkick Murphys; Ben Affleck; St. Paddy’s; Carl Yastrzemski; Bobby Orr falling over; Bill Belichick’s grubby hoodie). Check.

Plus, beating Boston still means something. You aren’t just beating this group of players. You are beating Bill Russell, Larry Bird and Bob Cousy. The Celtics are one of those special sports franchises that carries its history around with it.

It’s the same reason people get excited when they’ve beaten the Canadiens, even now that the Canadiens aren’t much to speak of. You’re not just beating a team. You’re chipping away at the mythology.

The Raptors are tooled up to be a top-tier team for a good, long while. Their young core (Siakam, VanVleet, Anunoby) is 26, 26 and 23, respectively. Add in another star via free agency and you are in dynastic territory.

(This is where the screen gets blurry, the action goes slo-mo and the Giannis Antetokounmpo dream sequence takes over. You can believe it will happen, but don’t say it out loud. That’s how you curse it.)

Their obvious rival in this yet-to-happen future scenario is Boston – just about as young and promising, though not yet as accomplished. These two teams could be at this for years.

There was more talk on Wednesday that the two clubs might stage a boycott in protest of police violence in the United States.

The Raptors and Celtics got together on Tuesday night to discuss the idea, among others.

“We’re all in this together,” Pascal Siakam said of the unusual gathering.

Beyond making a continental impression, such a gesture would twin the two teams in people’s minds. Especially so if it spreads throughout the league.

It’s one of those timeless narratives – opponents leaving the trenches to come together briefly in no-man’s land – that is constantly recycled. As such, it’s something people remember.

It’d be the Ace Bailey story through a glass brightly. In two sports cities where they never forget anything, that would be something worth remembering."

Ms. Byrne said she struggled with the decision but she has now relocated to Toronto.
“I spent quite a bit of time thinking about whether I could stay in Alberta,” Ms. Byrne said.","Open this photo in gallery Todd Kemper poses in the Upper Mission neighbourhood of Kelowna where he now owns a house after opting to move from Edmonton. Lucas Oleniuk/The Globe and Mail

When he was offered a job in British Columbia, Todd Kemper figured a potential loss on the sale of his house might be the price he had to pay to leave the Alberta market.

“I looked into my crystal ball and thought Alberta’s a one-trick pony – it always has been – and I do not see it performing well in the near- to mid-term,” Mr. Kemper said. “I thought if you can get out of this market now, do it. ... It’s inevitable that intelligent people can read the tea leaves and decide to get out.”

Thanks to more than a decade of volatility in Edmonton’s real-estate market, which started in 2009 with a housing-price correction and has continued with long periods of oil price fluctuations, Mr. Kemper’s house had not gained value over his seven years of ownership. He didn’t see that changing.

Story continues below advertisement

Instead, Mr. Kemper, who works as a scientist with the federal government, saw growing rancour between Alberta’s provincial government and its doctors and teachers, and few signs of economic hope in future.

He left Alberta in January, after he sold his Edmonton bungalow for the same price he bought it for in 2013. He considers himself lucky.

Analysts are divided on whether the growing anecdotes of professionals leaving Alberta is a bona fide trend that will affect its real estate market. Data on migration flows lag at least a year, and those now available predate both the COVID-19 pandemic and the results of public-sector cuts by the ruling United Conservative Party, which have mostly rolled out in 2020.

But as the province’s economy staggers through a prolonged downturn, magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic, some homeowners in Alberta’s professional class are choosing to exit the province and have accepted a loss, or will try to rent out their properties, to do so.

The factors many point to include not only the housing market itself, which is an outlier in Canada for its weakness, but also tough job prospects, a lack of faith that the oil and gas industry will recover and the tone of provincial discourse.

In April, 2019, Alberta’s UCP government was elected to replace the New Democratic Party government on a mandate to rein in public spending. The resulting cuts have been severe. The University of Alberta, for example, is now restructuring amid a reduction in provincial funding totalling $110.3-million for the years 2019-21. More than 1,000 people there have already been let go.

As the cuts have rolled out, drama has often followed. In March, Health Minister Tyler Shandro walked to Calgary doctor Mukarram Zaidi’s driveway and, allegedly, yelled at Mr. Zaidi over critical Facebook comments he had made about UCP cuts.

Story continues below advertisement

In July, a survey by the Alberta Medical Association found that 42 per cent of the province’s doctors are searching for work elsewhere. In a release, titled Looming physician exodus from Alberta, Christine Molnar, president of the association, said many have hit a breaking point.

“There are a host of opportunities for physicians across the globe. Alberta’s doctors aren’t practicing here because they have to, they practice here because they want to,” Dr. Molnar said in the release.

Position cuts led Carol Fenton, a medical health officer raised and educated with three degrees in Calgary, to look elsewhere for work. In late March, she accepted a job in B.C.

Dr. Fenton said she first attempted to rent her Calgary duplex, purchased in 2018, but could not find tenants at a rent that covered her costs. Dr. Fenton then listed the property for $5,000 less than she bought it for.

“We had, like, nothing – like, no action,” she said.

Dr. Fenton has now dropped the price by $30,000 but has yet to sell. “I’ve had two showings.”

Story continues below advertisement

She’s currently carrying both places and said she can drop the price further or rent for less than she pays on the mortgage. “Either way, I’m losing. But do I want an ongoing loss, or a one-time loss?”

Corinne Lyall, a broker with Royal LePage Benchmark in Calgary, said the city’s market has experienced a downturn as a result of COVID-19 but now, as parts of the provincial economy are reopened, it’s showing signs of recovery. Year-to-date sales are at just 7 per cent lower than they were in 2019, Ms. Lyall said, and some buyers are taking advantage of deals.

She said pent-up demand has boosted July sales. “In July, we’ve out-performed July of last year, and that’s because we had a delayed spring market because of COVID,” Ms. Lyall said.

Indeed, the Canadian Real Estate Association’s July report notes that sales are still rebounding from the effect of COVID-19. In Alberta, CREA numbers show sales are up in Calgary by nearly 16 per cent, month over month, and by nearly 10 per cent in Edmonton.

Still, some watching the market are less certain a recovery is coming. One is Barton Goth, an insolvency trustee with Edmonton’s Goth & Company Ltd.

Mr. Goth pointed out that Alberta homeowners with mortgages not secured with the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation have the option to strategically default – similar to rules in the United States that led in 2008 to the phenomenon known as ‘jingle mail’ or the sound of house keys mailed to banks.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Goth said he has helped many use this option during housing downturns in the past but also said his business often lags market difficulties.

“My phone’s been pretty quiet now as people are focused on survival first,” he said.

He expects that to change. “I fear that all our talk of the anticipated recovery is simply masking the Canadian reality. We are sitting atop a house of cards.”

Mr. Goth also said he sees a brain drain taking place in Alberta. “I do know people who are looking to move outside the province.”

One person who left is Joyce Byrne, a magazine professional who recently moved back to Toronto.

But though Ms. Byrne has left Alberta, she’s still tied to its housing market.

Story continues below advertisement

She arrived in Alberta in 2005, bought her one-bedroom Edmonton condo in 2007, near the height of the 2006-07 housing bubble. She has rented out the property since 2014 when she took a job in Calgary.

Ms. Byrne bought her condominium for $250,000. Thirteen years later, units in her building are currently listed for $170,000, and not selling, she said. Compounding things, Ms. Byrne is currently between jobs.

Ms. Byrne said she struggled with the decision but she has now relocated to Toronto.

“I spent quite a bit of time thinking about whether I could stay in Alberta,” Ms. Byrne said. “The rent [I collect] is lower than I pay for it every month. My tenant is like everybody else – ‘Am I going to have a job?’ I just decided, I have to do something, and I can’t be tied there any longer because of that condo.

“I have my fingers crossed I can continue to carry it.”"

While it has seemed 2020 is a write-off for international travel, the opposite may be true as the year wears on. To date, more than 50 countries have reopened their borders to Canadian visitors, from St. Lucia to Iceland. As well, several travel insurance providers have started offering coverage that includes COVID-19-related illnesses, with some countries, airlines and accommodations doing likewise (see sidebar).

Practical considerations aside, the fall of 2020 is shaping up to offer unprecedented globetrotting opportunities to Canadians who are willing to overlook the federal government’s globe-spanning non-essential travel advisory and endure the mandatory 14-day quarantine upon their return. Many of the world’s most popular destinations are expected to experience their quietest fall in recent memory (making physical distancing more viable).

Combine this tranquility with reopened diversions including museums, monuments, parks and patios, and the six destinations that follow are primed to put a positive spin on the pandemic.

COVID-19 considerations

Entry requirements: Most countries that have reopened their borders to Canadians are performing health checks upon arrival and will refuse entry to visitors displaying COVID-19 symptoms. Many destinations also require negative COVID-19 test results, typically obtained within 72 hours of departure, while others, such as Turks and Caicos and Bora Bora, call for proof of travel insurance.

Story continues below advertisement

Travel insurance: At press time, coverage of COVID-19-related illnesses was offered to Canadians by providers such as Medipac, Ontario Blue Cross, SafteyWing and HeyMondo. Some countries, such as Portugal, are also offering this kind of coverage to visitors, with airlines and resort chains including Emirates and Club Med doing likewise. This drastically alleviates the financial risks of international journeys, and could improve the level of care in some destinations.

Quarantine rules: At press time, government regulations required Canadians returning from international destinations to go directly to “suitable places of quarantine” without delay and stay there for 14 days. Hotels, resorts and short-term rental accommodations are not considered suitable.

The traditional assortment of small dishes designed for grazing throughout the Mediterranean and the Middle East is an ideal framework for portable lunching. Dips and spreads, flatbreads, olives, briny cheeses, stuffed grape leaves – they all travel well, pair well, keep well in the fridge and are delicious at room temperature.

Toast

Simple, familiar, and teen-friendly, toast is an ideal vehicle for all kinds of tasty things, both sweet and savoury. Toast made in the morning will stay crisp until you load it up to eat; pack it dry, buttered or drizzled or brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with salt. At lunchtime, spread and pile on your favourite things as you eat.

Pack: ricotta or other soft cheese, small jars of jam or honey, roughly smashed beans or chickpeas, small tins of oil-packed tuna, roasted veggies, a ripe avocado, a soft-boiled egg, crushed nuts (if they’re allowed where lunch is going) or anything else you can rummage from your fridge – saucy leftovers generally do well spooned onto toast.

At the ready

If your kids are learning remotely this year or coming home for lunch, having a stash of prepared items in the fridge will help everyone. Think of these as homemade convenience foods without the excess packaging – they’ll keep well in your fridge for at least a few days, and don’t need to be kept hot or cold to be delicious.

Hard boiled or jammy eggs: Gently lower as many eggs as you want to cook into simmering water and set the timer for 10 minutes for hard-boiled eggs or 7 to 8 minutes for eggs that are a bit soft/sticky/jammy. Run under cool water to stop them from cooking and store in the fridge.

Cooked grains and beans: Simmer a pot of rice, quinoa, barley, farro or other grains or pasta, or a pot of beans, chickpeas or lentils. Soft beans and chickpeas can be drizzled with olive oil and pesto and roughly smashed and lentils can be dressed with oil, vinegar, mustard, salt and pepper to marinate in the fridge while they wait to go into salads or grainy bowls, or onto toast, flatbreads or crackers.

Soft flatbread or sturdy bread: Flatbreads can scoop dip, be spread with or wrapped around things, and bread can be toasted and spread or topped with whatever you rummage from your cupboard or fridge.

Thick dips: Hummus, muhammara, salsa, labneh and other dippable, spreadable things taste better after a day or three in the fridge, and can be served with veggies, crackers, bread or tortilla chips, or spooned into or over a salad or grain bowl.

Leftovers: Making extra dinner while you’re at it is an easy lunch solution, whether roasted chicken or fish is turned into sandwiches and wraps or stews and baked dishes are simply reheated on another day.

Sauces: Garlicky yogurt, tahini, vinaigrettes and flavourful fresh green sauces will pull cooked grains, beans, leftover meat and veggies together into an interesting salad or grain bowl.

The first time I sat down to talk with Graeme Gibson, in 1970, I read his hand, as I was in the habit of doing for strangers in those reckless days. “Everything is connected to everything else,” I said sagely. “Your intellectual and creative selves are continuous with your lifeline and your fate line. It’s all one.” And so it was, and so it would be.

Fleeing the city and the complexities of a crumbled marriage, Graeme moved to a rented farm near Beeton, Ont., that year. I visited off and on, and then off, and then on. We were both working with the newly founded small publisher House of Anansi Press – I say “working” loosely because it was a young writers’ press and nobody got paid very much. I was editing Graeme’s book Eleven Canadian Novelists – radio interviews with writers that he’d done for Robert Weaver’s CBC show Anthology. It was my job to hack a pathway through the transcripts: They’d been typed up by a woman who turned out to be somewhat deaf, so I had to guess what the writers might actually have said.

When we weren’t busying ourselves with such publishing tasks, we were trying to arrange a life together. The man who owned the Beeton farmhouse wanted us to buy it, but someone had cut a piece out of the main beam of the old barn and stuck it over the fireplace – meaning that the barn would soon collapse – so we looked elsewhere. We didn’t have much money, but we finally found something we could afford: an 1835 farmhouse, uninhabited, uninsulated and, unknown to us at the time of purchase, haunted.

Having raised the sagging floor and discovered a big pile of well-rotted manure in the barn suitable for a vegetable garden, we settled down to write, more or less. Graeme was at the same time organizing the Writers’ Union of Canada and taking various literary odd jobs to make a semblance of an income, and on weekends and holidays we usually had a houseful of hungry people: his teenage sons, their friends and friends of ours on restful outings from the city, all of them joined midway through the 1970s by our newborn daughter. We had two stoves: a wood-burner, on which a cauldron of something was eternally simmering; and an electric one, with an oven suitable for reviving half-dead lambs. We had a washing machine of sorts but no dryer. Various of our preserved foods exploded in the root cellar. I won’t go into the matter of the sauerkraut, except to say that we should have made it outdoors.

In the midst of this intermittent chaos, Graeme wrote on, somewhat more than I did at the time, in fact. His first novel, Five Legs (1969), had done surprisingly well for such an experimental work; his second, Communion (1971), was a succès d’estime, but at the end of it he’d killed off Felix, the young man who’d first appeared in Five Legs. Now he was casting around for his next focal point. During this period, several proto-novels came and went; they would be started in a fire of optimism, then shelved when they failed to engage Graeme fully. He was an all-or-nothing kind of man.

Graeme was a person not only of enthusiasms but also of moral imperatives. He decided that since we had a hundred acres of weedy farmland, it was our duty to farm it. He didn’t want to be a city person lolling about idly in the country; he wanted the immersive experience. Needless to say, neither of us had ever spent time on a farm before. At auctions he acquired a second-hand baler and a harrow to go with the old tractor that had come with the property. What we grew on our rolling acres was alfalfa. Graeme later said that farming was driving around until something broke, then driving around to find the part to fix it, then driving around ...

We also accumulated an assortment of non-human beings. “What kind of animals should we have?” Graeme had asked an old farmer at the outset. “None” was the answer. Then, after a pause: “If you’re gonna have livestock, you’re gonna have dead stock.” And so it was, and so it would be. Things died. Sometimes we ate them.

We had chickens, for which Graeme built a henhouse and an enclosed yard; an old horse, which the poet Paulette Jiles had persuaded us to rescue; some ducks because we had a pond and what was a pond without ducks? Another horse, to keep the first one company; and some jumping cows whose escapes were the marvel of the neighbourhood; and a couple of geese that got stepped on by the cows and then eaten; and then – why? – some sheep, which had a habit of dying of gid or almost drowning in the pond; and, to round off this Noah’s Ark, a pair of peacocks.

The peacocks were for my birthday. They added unearthly screams to the ambience, which by now was quite Gothic. I won’t go into our attempt to raise chicks in an incubator – you have to get the temperature just right, and we didn’t, and Frankenchicks is what came out – nor the sad tale of the male peacock, who was deprived of his peahen by a blood-drinking weasel and went mad and became a mass murderer of the hens.

Thus began Perpetual Motion, Graeme’s tale of pioneer farming set in a house strangely like the one we were living in and on a piece of land oddly like ours. The protagonist, Robert Fraser, is a man of enthusiasms, like Graeme, and his frustrations and crackpot obsessions have at least a cousinly relationship to Graeme’s. So do the black flies and thunderstorms and recalcitrant cows that plague him.

But although some of the incidents and details are immediately recognizable to me, not everything in the book came from personal experience. Graeme combed through dictionaries of slang and unconventional usage to make sure his characters were using words they really would have used, unpleasant though modern tastes might find some of these. He consulted local histories – what was going on in and around Shelburne, Ont., in the early to mid-19th century? What had the people who’d settled the area been like – those from whom many in Ontario were descended, including Graeme? Not always very savoury, the novel tells us.

The digging up of the bones of extinct giant animals and the exhibiting of them was a much-publicized pursuit in the 19th century, and Southern Ontario was a hot spot for mammoths, Graeme discovered. So it’s not anachronistic that Robert Fraser unearths such a skeleton, nor that he hopes to profit by it. Public interest was high, as was controversy: Such animals were a challenge to the prevailing biblical narrative. Were these beasts dragons that had perished in Noah’s Flood, and if not, what were they? Fraser’s excavated mammoth bones set the keynote for the novel; as the mammoth went, so might we overweening humans go, was the subtext.

Then there was the history of the perpetual motion machine, that alluring but impossible Holy Grail sought by many inventors in those times, and the huge flights of passenger pigeons – so damaging to crops – and the money that could be made from slaughtering them. The search for perpetual motion and the extinction of the passenger pigeon were based on the seemingly incurable human hope that there is indeed a free lunch eternally available on this Earth. Nature’s bounty – here in the form of pigeons – will never run out. The first law of thermodynamics can be cheated. It’s a delusion, but one that persists to this day.

The Gibsonian style is difficult to describe. Hesitations in speech and thought, doublethink, expletives and spluttering, the tics and tricks of verbal communication and the failures to communicate: These are present to a greater or lesser extent in all of Graeme’s fictions. Farce and antic dispositions and human stupidity and nobility and futility and tragedy are never far apart, though tempered with a sort of loony cheerfulness. The last word in Perpetual Motion is “moon,” a Western symbol for illusion and deception. But despite the explosion of his crazed machine, Robert Fraser does not give up; he continues the “desolate search” for something that – try as he might, plausible though he may sound in his efforts to convince others – does not exist.

Graeme almost didn’t finish Perpetual Motion because three-quarters of the way through it he nearly died. In mid-November of 1979, I was in Windsor, Ont., doing a book event, and when I got back to my hotel room there was a message waiting for me. It was from our friend and neighbour Peter Pearson – the filmmaker – who was standing watch in the hospital in Alliston, Ont. Graeme was in the operating room. He had a ruptured duodenal ulcer, which, given a few more hours, would have put an end to him. Eight weeks later, though still wobbly, he was back on the fictional track. He worked on the novel during the two or three months he spent in Scotland while I was holding down the farm with help. Shortly after this, we moved back to the city, a choice for which Graeme’s near-death and weakened condition were only some of the reasons. Perpetual Motion was finished and published in 1982, with translations into French, Spanish, German and, as I recall, Polish.

Graeme’s near-death was a hint of what was to happen in his life during the 1980s. His father, Brigadier-General T. G. Gibson, died in the middle of the decade, and his younger brother, Alan Gibson – a film and television director in England – followed in 1987. (His mother had died earlier, in the mid-1960s.) These deaths, his own near-miss and the fact that in the natural course of events he himself would be next in his family to go – a fact of which he was more than aware – were the impetus behind his fourth and final novel, Gentleman Death (1993).

It’s a curious book; but then, which of his books was not? It begins with a novel being written half-heartedly by a moderately successful novelist strangely like Graeme. This comically unsatisfactory novel bears more than a passing resemblance to some of those that Graeme himself had cast aside. The real-life novelist is called Robert Fraser, like the protagonist of Perpetual Motion, and is clearly a descendent. Does novel-writing have the same place in the mental life of Robert Fraser the Second as the search for a perpetual motion machine had in the life of Robert Fraser the First? Is it too a delusion, a clutch at the moon? Possibly.

Robert Fraser’s novel weaves in and out of Robert Fraser’s life, and his memories and dreams inform both. The memories of his childhood during the Second World War are absolutely Graeme’s. His mother’s struggles as a woman left to cope with two boys during the early 1940s, her depressions after her hospital visits to soldiers mangled by the war, his own fears about his overseas father as the fathers of his friends were killed one after another – we in the family remember him describing these events in much the same words as those used by Robert Fraser. The illness and death of his beloved brother, his grief and loss – these too are in the book. His battles with his father, then his caretaking as that father ages, becomes frail and starts seeing people who aren’t there – all of it happened as described. Robert’s quizzical attempt to come to terms with mortality, his experience of ghosts and his dreams of the departed, his recognition of the death’s head behind his own face – these too were Graeme’s. They are also widely shared human experiences, although each of us experiences them in our own way.

No spoilers, but Graeme’s protagonist does achieve an equilibrium of sorts. Living in the past, however unhappy that past may have been, is a protection against the knowledge of our own mortality, since in our past we ourselves are always alive, no matter how many around us have died, and to live in the present is to accept our inevitable death. Yet if you aren’t alive to the present, how can you live your life to the full? Death the Gentleman waits for us all, not outside us but within us; our secret sharer, and in a sense our friend, for what would life be if we were doomed to live forever? “Here it is at last, the distinguished thing,” Henry James is said to have said on his deathbed, a quotation with which Graeme was familiar. Robert Fraser is not completely Graeme, of course; but, as I’d said when I’d first met him, his creative life and his real life were one.

What of the flirtations of Robert Fraser? Were those also from Graeme’s actual life, you may wonder? Search me. I myself seem to be in the book too, although I’ve been given quite a different body. Names have been changed to protect the innocent, to no avail as usual.

After Gentleman Death, Graeme attempted one more novel. It was to be called Moral Disorder and was entangled with his experiences at PEN Canada, dedicated to supporting writers imprisoned elsewhere in the world, and with World Wildlife, alert to habitat destruction. It also registered his increasingly horrified view of politics and cynicism and venality and the way things were going, particularly in relation to the natural world. He wrestled with this novel for a time – he was not an easeful writer, he couldn’t just turn things out – but he failed to convince himself and abandoned the project in 1996. I asked him for the title – it’s pleasingly suggestive – and used it for a book of short stories, so that much at least of this lost book survives.

By this time Graeme was deeply in the world of birds, on several levels. (It will not have escaped notice that Perpetual Motion is the work of a proto-environmentalist.) As I’ve said, he was all-or-nothing, and his enthusiasms were consuming. The result, eventually, was The Bedside Book of Birds, which took 10 years to get published – initially publishers did not grasp either the concept or the public hunger for engagement with the avian world – and finally appeared in 2005. It’s a miscellany – a collection of the ways in which human beings have interacted with birds, always and everywhere, through myth, art, literature and science – with each section introduced by a personal essay.

BBB, as it was known in his filing system, sold more than any of Graeme’s other books and brought in an avalanche of letters from grateful readers. It was at one with his life, as was all his work. Had Robert Fraser the Second started earlier, he might well have been an ornithologist, as Graeme himself frequently said he wished he had been. But as he was also in the habit of saying, “What might have been is an abstraction.”

He was what he was.

Or, rather, he is what he is.

National Bank of Canada’s third-quarter profit bounced back nearer to pre-pandemic levels, falling 1 per cent from a year ago even as it added to reserves to cover potential future losses.

The Montreal-based bank reported profit of $602-million, or $1.66 a share, for the fiscal quarter that ended July 31, compared with $608-million, or $1.66, a year earlier.

On average, analysts expected the bank to post earnings per share of $1.30, according to Refinitiv.

Canada’s sixth-largest bank added new provisions for credit losses – which are funds banks hold in reserve to cover potential defaults – of $143-million, up 66 per cent from a year ago. But those new provisions declined sharply from the $504-million National Bank set aside in the prior quarter, as it grappled with the effects of the novel coronavirus on the global economy.

Revenue rose by 1 per cent to $1.97-billion, and expenses fell 7 per cent to $1.07-billion, mostly because of special items recorded a year ago.

But while three other major banks that have reported earnings this week boosted their capital levels as corporations paid down balances on credit lines drawn early in the pandemic, National Bank’s common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio – a key measure of a bank’s resilience – was unchanged from the prior quarter, at 11.4 per cent.

Profit from personal and commercial banking, the bank's largest division, fell 15 per cent to $233-million, as lending margins narrowed and growth in personal and commercial loan portfolios slowed, while provisions increased year over year.

The impact of the pandemic has so far been dampened by a program that allowed banks to defer payments on loans for clients in financial hardship. As of July 31, National Bank had deferred loans to personal banking clients – including mortgages and credit card debt – worth $4-billion, and commercial and corporate loans of $4.5-billion. Though the commercial balance was unchanged from the prior quarter, which ended April 30, the balance of personal loans with deferred payments declined from $9.4-billion.

In the financial-markets division, profit was $188-million, up 5 per cent from a year earlier, driven by a large increase in revenue from fixed-income securities. But the results did not match the record earnings posted by the capital-markets arms of Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal in the same quarter.

Wealth management generated profit of $128-million, up 2 per cent from a year earlier, and the bank’s U.S. specialty finance and international division, which includes its ownership of ABA Bank in Cambodia, increased profits by 26 per cent year-over-year, to $87-million.

The bank kept its quarterly dividend steady at $1.08 a share, following guidance from Canada's banking regulator not to raise payouts to investors.

Provisions for credit losses – or the money banks set aside to cover loans that may not be repaid – were $675-million. That was up 59 per cent from a year ago and high by historical standards, but it was roughly half the total provisions some analysts predicted for the bank. Provisions fell precipitously from the prior quarter, when RBC earmarked $2.83-billion in new reserves against potential future losses.

Profit in RBC’s core retail-banking division came under pressure from tighter lending margins, falling 18 per cent to $1.37-billion. The division also accounted for most of the bank’s provisions for credit losses, adding $527-million in reserves, more than half of which was for loans that are already impaired.

But the full impact of the pandemic has been delayed by payment deferrals granted to clients on mortgages, credit cards, personal and business loans. As of July 31, about 278,400 RBC clients still had payments deferred on 344,541 loans worth $62.8-billion, down from nearly 580,000 loans totalling $78.3-billion last quarter. In RBC’s Canadian retail-banking division, 12 per cent of all loans were still deferred, with a value of $55-billion, though some clients with deferrals have chosen to continue making payments.

The decline in retail profits was roughly offset by a surge in profit from capital markets, which increased 45 per cent to $949-million compared with a year ago. Higher returns from fixed-income and equities trading was the main driver amid volatile markets recovering from steep losses at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic.

The bank’s insurance division also boosted profit by 6 per cent to $216-million, but wealth-management earnings fell 12 per cent to $562-million.

The bank's capital levels improved as corporations paid down balances on credit lines that they had drawn early in the pandemic. RBC's common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio increased to 12 per cent, from 11.7 per cent in the prior quarter, which was already the highest among the major Canadian banks. The CET1 ratio is an important measure of a bank's ability to absorb losses and continue lending.

“Aviv should be thinking, ‘What do I know that others need?’ and ‘Who would benefit from it?’” Ms. Vassell says.
While networking is an important part of any job search, Ms. Vassell encourages Aviv to be active in the process.
“I want to learn something about what the applicant is passionate about,” Ms. Donnell says.
“She should promote the relationships that she fostered in her field,” says Ms. Donnell.","Aviv, 30, worked as an urban planner and project coordinator for a consulting group for six years before heading back to school to earn a master of museum studies. “I found the consulting space extremely narrow-minded and wanted to move to more progressive circles that support anti-racism and anti-oppression,” she writes. “Museums are highly problematic spaces with colonial roots and systemic oppression, but there has been a movement to ‘decolonize’ museums for decades – I want to be part of this ongoing effort.”

After graduating from her master’s program in June, Aviv has been unable to find work in her new field. Instead, she’s been working at the clothing store where she was employed part-time during her studies. “There are not many opportunities and lots of competition from my cohort of graduates across schools,” she says. Her ideal role would be “in a community arts organization that engages communities and animates public spaces through street art.” But given the limited job market, she’s also applying to galleries and history museums to build up relevant experience. “I’ve also been looking and applying for jobs beyond the GTA.”

Aviv has a clear passion and direction for her new career but few job opportunities to consider. So we asked career coach Shauna Vassell of Koncave Coaching and Consulting and Jenny Donnell, manager of the human resources at the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, how Aviv can best position her resume and her prior experience.

The resume

What the career coach says

Ms. Vassell commends the format and layout of Aviv’s resume but has plenty of suggestions for revamping its content. To start, Ms. Vassell suggests that Aviv start her resume with a professional summary which would incorporate content from her current Skills section. “She has a wonderful list of skills and some transferable ones too from her work as an urban planner,” Ms. Vassell says. “The summary is to get a sense of her ideal role – not just the culture and work environment, but the ‘When I grow up, I want to be…’ position.” The breakdown of Aviv’s work experiences could also use improvement. “Each bullet should start with a verb,” Ms. Vassell recommends. “I noticed she used ‘enthusiastically’ and a few other adjectives, which don’t add much information or emphasize what she did.” Instead, Aviv should add qualitative accomplishments and outcomes to her resume. For example: “How big was the exhibit? How many attendees were there? How many artists were brought together? What were the Instagram stats for participation?”

Ms. Vassell believes that Aviv can give her resume a stronger edge by showcasing her previous experience in a way that applies to her new career. “The resume almost lists her as a junior starting from scratch with a few internships, until you flip to page two and see ‘urban planner’ and ‘multi-million dollar,‘” Ms. Vassell says. Adding a professional summary will help to achieve this connection, along with an Accomplishments section where she can showcase quantitative achievements that would otherwise be buried in her resume, like “Managed a GoFundMe campaign raising $600 for an exhibition.”

To expand her job opportunities, Ms. Vassell encourages Aviv to target “horizontal linkages” between companies and organizations, as opposed to focusing too narrowly on a linear, upward path. “Aviv should be thinking, ‘What do I know that others need?’ and ‘Who would benefit from it?’” Ms. Vassell says. “This will give her insights on how she can leverage relationships and networking to connect with people in these areas.” She also recommends researching companies that have made commitments to social change, and “following the funding” to learn what organizations they are working with.

While networking is an important part of any job search, Ms. Vassell encourages Aviv to be active in the process. “Follow the thought leaders, get seen and be intentional when connecting with people and building your network,” she says. “Actively engage with people. Don’t just add them and forget them in your connections.”

What the industry expert says

Ms. Donnell also appreciates Aviv’s current format and layout. “Her resume appealed to me with the use of colour and space. The colour was unique, which implied a creative person, and the font size also indicated thoughtfulness to the reader.” As Ms. Vassell suggested, Ms. Donnell also suggests adding a capsule statement about herself to the top of the resume. “I want to learn something about what the applicant is passionate about,” Ms. Donnell says. “This would make the recruiter realize that Aviv has a sincere interest in and passion for the arts and that it’s not just a job that she’s after.”

Aviv’s current arts experience would qualify her for entry-level positions at the McMichael such as a gallery guide, part-time support for a studio or weekend camp, or in retail sales. “These front-line positions also provide exposure to the inner workings of a museum and opportunities to speak to staff in different positions,” Ms. Donnell says. However, to achieve a better position in programming or education, Aviv will have to find ways to bridge her prior urban-planning career to the role she’s applying for. “She could enhance how her previous full-time experience has transferable skills to programming posts,” says Ms. Donnell.

Aviv has plenty of transferable skills that she can highlight in her resume. “She should promote the relationships that she fostered in her field,” says Ms. Donnell. “Working with municipalities bodes well in the not-for-profit sector, and her outreach to the community and relationship-building experience are transferable skills that will support her desire to work in public programming.” In addition, Aviv could also highlight the regular reporting she did in previous roles, which demonstrates her knowledge of performance indicators and how to measure successful engagements. With some resume rejigging, Aviv could qualify for intermediate arts-programming roles if she’s able to connect her previous experience to new job requirements.

As Aviv noted herself, posted jobs for arts and museum roles are slim, but she can help forge connections and build her network by reaching out to organizations where she feels her skills would be a fit. “Don’t sell yourself short,” Ms. Donnell advises. “Be proud of all you have to offer. State confidently how you can do the job without being overbearing.”

The new resume

Aviv has revamped her resume to target a community-arts role. She has added a professional summary to bring her years of professional experience to the top, along with her passion and interest in the arts. She has also added an accomplishments section to highlight relevant accomplishments that were missing from her resume, with keywords and stats bolded. Academic project highlights were also moved up, while the education section was moved to the end.

Within her job descriptions, she has removed adverbs at the beginning of bullets so that all bullet points start with a verb. Aviv has also added more quantifiable detail to job tasks to help emphasize what she accomplished in each role.

So of course I opened it right away.

The featured chart was a global economic surprise index which compares data releases to consensus estimates. In these indices, readings of zero indicate that the most relevant global data points (the more important data like GDP and industrial production carry more weight in the index) are being announced in-line with economist estimates.

Story continues below advertisement

The index is now near record highs indicating that reported economic results are coming in more beyond consensus forecasts than at any time since 2003. (The Citi Global Economic Surprise Index can be followed at PIMCO’s Canadian website here).

For Mr. Saravelos these extremes are not sustainable. “Can this level of positivity be sustained?” he writes. “Does it make sense to be as bullish on risky assets with such an unprecedented positive run of data having already taken place?”

The analyst also noted that with colder weather approaching for most G10 nations, the potential for new COVID-19 outbreaks in closed spaces creates more risks to economic growth.

I’m not sure how seriously to take this warning. Stronger-than-expected economic growth is clearly good for corporate profits and stock prices. Mr. Saravelos has a point, though, because it’s unreasonable to expect the surprise index to stay at current levels. If equity investors have priced stocks as if the speed of the post-pandemic recovery stays at the current pace, some significant corrections may be in store.

Stocks to ponder

Nutrien Ltd. Shares of this, and other companies with potash mines in Canada, have bounced higher over the past month. The jump reflects improving fundamentals in the fertilizer industry. It also reflects geopolitical turmoil – in particular, the decision of many Belarussians to walk off their jobs as part of mass demonstrations aimed at toppling the country’s long-time dictator, Alexander Lukashenko. The protests matter to Canada’s potash miners because Belarus produces a fifth of global potash exports. Continued chaos in Belarus could disrupt the country’s potash production in the short-term and lead to higher potash prices over the long-term.

Is the value premium in Canadian stocks dead, too? You may be surprised

It has been all over the investing news for months: “The value premium is dead.” Value (low price-to-earnings or price-to-book) stocks, the pundits say, are no longer outperforming growth (high P/E or P/B) stocks. But almost invariably they are referring to U.S. markets, which normally attract all the attention. And indeed, evidence suggests the value premium (that is, value-stock returns minus growth-stock returns) has been mostly negative in the United States for the past 10 to 12 years. But is this also the case in the Canadian market? Dr. George Athanassakos has done some data crunching to find the answer. (for everyone)

How Victoria Woodhull made a fortune in the stock market

Victoria Woodhull was ahead of her time. In 1868, she made a fortune in the stock market. Two years later, she and her sister were the first women to launch a stock-brokerage firm on Wall Street. Then, in 1872, she became the first female to run for U.S. president. With Aug. 26 being Women’s Equality Day, it’s a fitting time to tell her extraordinary story, courtesy of Larry MacDonald.

Ask Globe Investor

Question: What is a value stock and can you give me some examples of value stocks? I read an article about them but it was somewhat confusing. Two of the stocks suggested were ExxonMobil and Johnson & Johnson.

Answer: Investopedia defines a value stock as one that trades at a lower price relative to its fundamentals, such as dividends, earnings, or sales. Such stocks usually offer a high dividend yield, low price/book ratio and/or a low p/e ratio. Value stocks typically trade at a bargain price relative to their peers.

I wouldn’t classify Johnson & Johnson (JNJ-N) as a value stock. It has a p/e ratio of over 26 and a dividend payout of 2.73 per cent. ExxonMobil (XOM-N) has a p/e of 25.83 and a dividend of 8.09 per cent. The high dividend suggests the market believes it is not sustainable and likely to be cut, which would hurt the share price.

Story continues below advertisement

Two stocks I suggest fall into the value category as defined by Investopedia are Canadian Utilities (p/e of 14.95, yield of 5.25 per cent) and U.S. telecom Verizon (VZ-N) (p/e of 12.73, yield of 4.2 per cent). Also, the bank stocks look like good value plays at this time.

Victoria Woodhull was ahead of her time. In 1868, she made a fortune in the stock market. Two years later, she and her sister were the first women to launch a stock-brokerage firm on Wall Street.

Then, in 1872, she became the first female to run for U.S. president. Women who tried to vote back then were arrested and fined $100. But the law did not expressly forbid them from campaigning, so Woodhull entered the presidential race. She just couldn’t vote for anyone, including herself.

With Aug. 26 being Women’s Equality Day, it’s a fitting time to tell her extraordinary story.

Story continues below advertisement

Woodhull was born in 1838 to Buck and Roxy Claflin. When she was still a child, they put her to work as a spiritual medium in the family’s travelling medicine show. At 15, she married Dr. Canning Woodhull. They had two children and divorced after 11 years (but she kept his last name).

Meeting railway tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt was pivotal to her stock-market fortune

Woodhull and her younger sister, Tennessee Claflin, later moved to New York to set up shop as clairvoyants and faith healers. That’s when they met Cornelius Vanderbilt, the wealthiest man in the United States.

Vanderbilt, then in his senior years and recently widowed, wanted to communicate with his deceased mother. Woodhull obliged, holding séances to put him in touch.

He also hired Claflin for her talents as a massage healer. Rumours soon circulated of some intimacies and a marriage proposal from Vanderbilt (he was turned down).

The other thing Vanderbilt wanted was for Woodhull to use her clairvoyant skills to make stock recommendations. Her picks were hugely successful, netting close to a million dollars in 1868. The gains were shared with the sisters.

In reality, Woodhull was getting the stock tips not from the spirits but from her good friend Josie Mansfield, mistress of Wall Street titan Jim Fisk. She heard firsthand of his market moves and passed on what she had learned to Woodhull.

An important manoeuvre for Fisk at the time was buying up gold to corner the market. The plan was to push up prices and squeeze the short sellers (press them to buy back and return the stocks they had borrowed), then sell at the top to the momentum and trend-following traders. Woodhull’s spirits made sure Vanderbilt’s trades were on the right side of market trends.

Story continues below advertisement

Wall Street brokerage is a success

Impressed by Woodhull’s stock-picking track record, Vanderbilt helped the sisters open a Wall Street brokerage in 1870. It proved a success. New York had a lot of wealthy widows who felt more comfortable with female brokers.

Running for president

When Woodhull ran for U.S. president in 1872, she ended up spending election day in jail, charged with libel for an article she wrote. The charge was later dismissed.

She and her sister live happily ever after

After Vanderbilt died in 1877, the sisters moved to England. Woodhull married into the landed gentry and lived a very respectable and affluent lifestyle for the next 50 years. Her sister also married well, becoming a baronetess and one of the wealthiest persons in England.

Do you have any tips for how to help them get along?

You are not alone and there is a lot you can do to help them get along better.

First, make sure they take breaks from each other. The conflicts might be happening partly because they’re tired of each other. Have some time every day where they play on their own. You can have a name for it, like Quiet Time, and each child plays in his or her room or in a different space. Sometimes one child wants to play together more than the other, so make sure that if one sibling says, “I don’t want to play,” you support that child at least some of the time. It could be that one of your children is more introverted and not getting enough time alone.

Story continues below advertisement

Have established property and sharing rules. I recommend that parents do not force their children to share property that belongs only to one child, such as a birthday gift or something bought with the child’s own money. It’s up to that child whether to share it – or not. If it’s a toy that belongs to the whole family, each child should be able to play with it until he or she is done. Imagine if another adult demanded to use your phone or your car. Or imagine if you were in the middle of using a piece of equipment at the gym and someone told you your turn had been long enough. Forced sharing does not make kids more generous and it contributes to sibling resentment.

A great deal of fighting is caused by sibling rivalry: jockeying to come out on top. Sibling rivalry is always about, “Who does Mom or Dad love more?” or, “Will I get my needs met?” There are a couple of things you can do to decrease the rivalry.

Make time for one-on-one time with each child. Your children have a biologically driven need for your love and attention. They want to be assured that you love them and that you couldn’t love anyone else more. Take 15 minutes a day to show your child there is plenty of love and attention for them. There’s a great parenting tool for this called Special Time. Set aside your to-do list and find a time when you won’t be interrupted. Tell your child, “I’m all yours for the next 15 minutes. What would you like to play?” The key here is “play.” Dolls, stuffed animals, Lego, imaginary play and roughhousing are all great choices. No screens or structured adult activities like baking. Joining your child in their world of play is the best way to fill their deep need for attention and connection. Try for 15 minutes with each child and each parent every day. You will see a decrease in your children’s fighting when they know they will get you all to themselves for at least a little while every day.

Be Switzerland when intervening in sibling fights. We do need to intervene to prevent physical violence or the most dominant sibling getting their way (or both). However, if we intervene as judge and jury, even if we are “right” and careful not to favour one child, it will increase sibling rivalry. The child whose side we take feels victorious – “Mom loves me best!” – while the “loser” plots revenge on their sibling – “I’ll get them next time!” The key is to be neutral: help them talk to each other and come up with a mutually agreeable solution using conflict negotiation. If we take sides and solve the problem, they will never learn how to work things out and they will grow even more resentful of each other.

It can be difficult, but with some strategies, clear boundaries and some time and effort, you can help them stop fighting and be best buddies as they grow up.

In a quiet corner of my doctor’s office, I think about two things. One is the irony of waiting the painful wait my own patients usually endure. The other, the last time I experienced live music.

The microphone’s snap and crackle, the glistening sweat on the musician’s foreheads, the rumble of the floorboards from the stomping feet. There, in a small fishing village on the western edge of Cape Breton, N.S., I unknowingly became part of a cèilidh.

After stocking up on camping supplies, most visitors don’t give Chéticamp more than a sideways glance. My sights, I remember, weren’t set on its generous people, clapboard homes or dirt-covered roads. Rather, they were squarely on the ribbons of the Cabot Trail once my partner and I made camp on the grassy tongue of a cliff. The sun – the first I’d seen of it in weeks – in a cloudless sky had transformed the Gulf of St. Lawrence into a giant pool of liquid gold; a scene so lurid with colour, it looked like the stuff of a cheap postcard. I thought I was standing in a dream.

A few hours later, I would be standing in a pub.

When night fell, my partner’s phone buzzed with a message. An urgent e-mail needed her attention. “I think we have to drive into town,” she said, hanging by the thread of a single bar of cell reception. I was a sheltered urbanite who never ventured much beyond city limits, and was still getting used to the natural darkness, a black so dense it swallowed all forms of light. The glow of a full moon and a sky stippled with more stars than I ever knew existed lit our way as we stepped into my car and inched carefully toward a pub we had passed earlier in the day.

We ended up driving past it. Twice.

We faced the doors like a pair of frontier-beaten interlopers who’d travelled long and hard to get to the watering hole of a town they had little business in, and then pushed through them with an anxious sense of triumph. A number of stares met us, thick and curious. The place wasn’t full. It wasn’t empty, either. We eyed a table far off in the corner, and I took not one step forward before a hand flashed in front of me.

“It’ll be $5,” said a faint voice in a French lilt. I threw back my head in disbelief.

“Each? On a Wednesday?”

A woman emerged from behind the palm, her look matter-of-fact. “It’s Talent Night,” she replied, and then seeing my expression, added, “For the steak dinner you might win tonight!” Forking over a crumpled $10, the last money in my pocket, she tore two raffle tickets and handed one to each of us, which we took to our seats in the cool angle of a shadow.

The trio on stage formed a motley crew. The oldest, a thin, sage-like man, had wisps of coarse white hair that encircled his head, similar to the lattice of a bird’s nest. He bowed a fiddle. The other two were younger, ruddier and stockier and seemed, perhaps, a little less sacred. Strumming guitars, half-empty beer bottles stood beside their stools and cigarettes were pinched behind their ears. They sang in English, and they sang in French. While we struggled to work the Wi-Fi, every now and then they cajoled one of the regulars clustered by the stage to join them.

“Claude!” they shouted. “Come, come sing one for us!”

Claude initially balked at their demands. But hands around him pushed him forward. Despite appearing so shy, he could really belt them out. In his deep sandpaper voice, the traditional songs that left his lips were haunting and elegiac at one turn, and alive and spry on the next. In front of him, denim-clad hips twisted and turned and plaid-covered shoulders dropped and swayed. Even I found myself spelled by their power, like siren songs to a wary soul.

Hands clapped, and the room around me swelled with hope and love and laughter. What I didn’t know then was that I needed these feelings. For at the time, my heart was filled with fear.

Weeks earlier I made the discovery no one wishes to make. There were three lumps in my neck. Several smaller ones, I’ve found since. I knew what they could be. As a resident physician, I spoke them into being, into remission, into recurrence, every day with my patients: their balding heads, steroid-swollen faces and plastic ports bulging beneath their skin. I was afraid. But I kept all this locked up inside me. Life was barrelling forward, and there, on the world’s edge in Cape Breton, I dug in my heels to keep it from going over.

So what then, if I told you, that I happened upon a peace that transcended all others? It was a peace beyond naked woods and the monastic quiet and isolation of nature. It was beyond the cracks of twigs, the roll of rocks and the give of wet soil under my footfalls; it was beyond the sound of flowing streams that plunged into cold crystal pools and the fires that licked flames into the heavens.

In a modest wood-panelled room, my spirit was both let loose and held close by the music. I felt vulnerable and protected. I was no longer retreating from a world I knew, but, instead, forming connections with a world I didn’t.

Music tends to move us. It brings us toward the faces we miss, the times we long for and the places we’d rather be. But live music is different. It is absolute in its inertia. It slows us down. It makes real no reality but the one we’re in, no company but the people we’re with.

Cèilidhs have offered a reprieve from the hard knock life in these remote corners of Nova Scotia for centuries; these gatherings for socializing, singing, dancing and storytelling are a way of living, of surviving. That night, those hardened islanders showed me that to feel cast off alone is to not be lost. The life we choose to live is only as rich as the life we choose to share. Trawling the pub’s website, with “Talent Night” put on hold, now, like all of our own lives, I can only imagine that some part of theirs is missing, too.

That night, my partner held out her hand. I took it. Peering out onto the moonlit water stretching to infinity from the pub’s window, the scene filled me with promise and possibility, as well as with sadness and doubt. This life we cut neatly into pieces, calculated and predictable, can be turned over in an instant. But our existence in that moment, all that flesh and bone, seeming so utterly insignificant, was conferred a blessed meaning.

We’ve made the hard decision to send our kids back to school this fall. But they’re feeling really worried about it; do you have any ideas for how we can help them?

I can certainly understand why your children would be nervous (and you as well!). Our lives over the past five months have been upturned and dominated by the threat of COVID-19, and now we’re telling them they are going back to school. Here are some strategies you can use to help everyone in the family decrease their anxiety and manage it when you can’t decrease it.

Story continues below advertisement

Don’t add to their worry

If we don’t want our kids to feel more worried than they already are, we need to hide from them our own frustration and anxiety about the school situation. Children are emotional sponges and will absorb whatever anxiety you are expressing. Try not to talk about your fears in front of them. Talk to your partner or a friend instead.

Be realistic but positive

I am telling my daughter, “It’s really great news that the COVID numbers are down. This means it’s safer to be back in school than it was in the spring. We also know a lot more about how the disease is transmitted now. At the same time, there is risk. Life always has some risk and uncertainty. Whatever happens, we’ll figure it out.” Anxiety is the feeling that you won’t be able to cope with the scary thing. What you want to cultivate is the attitude that this is hard but we can handle it.

Identify what you can control and prepare as best you can

This might include practising wearing a mask at home for increasing lengths of time. Give your kids some fun strategies to wash their hands for 30 seconds and have them show you what a great job they can do. Depending on your child’s age, you could teach and play at the same time. Play a “Don’t Touch Your Face!” game or “Closer Than Two Metres is Hot Lava!” game.

Try an aggressive laughter regimen

Laughter is a wonderful anti-anxiety tool. It clears our bodies of stress chemicals such as cortisol and adrenalin and releases stored-up tensions. Try some play or roughhousing that gets your child laughing for 10 minutes every morning and every afternoon or evening. The sillier the better. Follow your child’s laughter by doing more of whatever gets them laughing.

Teach them to talk back to their Worry Brain

This concept is from the wonderful book Anxious Kids, Anxious Parents, by Lynn Lyons and Reid Wilson. If reassurance isn’t working, it’s likely that your child has a very sensitive Worry Brain or amygdala. A sensitive amygdala is like a smoke alarm that goes off when we burn toast. We learn that we need to open the window and reset the smoke alarm rather than run out into the yard and call 911.

In this same way, we want to teach our child that excessive worry is a false alarm and that they can hear the alarm but they don’t need to act on it. They can learn to reset the amygdala’s emergency response by talking to their Worry Brain, “I hear you telling me it isn’t safe to go to school, Worry Brain. Thanks for trying to keep me safe but I can handle it.” If you find that your child is worrying excessively and it’s getting in the way of your lives, it’s a good idea to talk to your family doctor.

Also, parents need to understand that it’s okay to worry about making the wrong choice. Since none of us have a crystal ball, it’s important to remember that we are making the best decision we can with the information we have and considering the needs of our families. One thing I try to remind myself when I’m feeling stressed about our current situation is that our kids are resilient and so are we. We can handle this.

Laramie (12-3-0) wept in the cage following the victory, which came on his late mother’s birthday.

On Tuesday, for the first time in the playoffs, almost the entire Canucks’ bench bought in, with 16 of 18 skaters throwing themselves in front of a hail of vulcanized rubber to help goalie Jacob Markstrom preserve a 5-2 win over the Golden Knights.

That evens the best-of-seven NHL playoff series at one game apiece, with Game 3 set for Thursday at Rogers Place.

“It lifts the bench up, for sure. You can hear it on the bench when guys block shots,” Vancouver head coach Travis Green told reporters on a Zoom call Wednesday.

“You don’t win if you don’t have certain elements in your game, and sacrifice and will are part of it for sure at this time of year.”

The Canucks, coming off a 5-0 drubbing in Game 1, jumped out to a 2-0 lead against the Golden Knights in Game 2 Tuesday before the real shooting started.

The second period was played almost entirely in Vancouver’s end, with the Knights cycling the puck and shooting, reloading and blasting away again. After 60 minutes, the Golden Knights had 93 shot attempts: 40 shots on goal, 40 blocked and 13 missed altogether.

They managed one goal for their efforts in the second period, but then gave up a late period goal to Elias Pettersson, which Vegas coach Peter DeBoer called “a back-breaker.”

The Canucks have been upping their blocking game as the playoffs have progressed. Against the Minnesota Wild, no more than nine Canucks a night blocked shots. That number went up to an average of 11 against the St. Louis Blues.

Against Vegas, 12 players took the rubber in the Game 1 debacle, while everyone but Adam Gaudette and Brock Boeser weathered at least one shot in Game 2.

Veteran defencemen Alex Edler and Chris Tanev lead the way – by a longshot. The pair have combined for 83 of the 250 blocked shots faced in Vancouver’s 12 playoff games (45 for Edler and 38 for Tanev). One-third of every blocked shot is going off one of them.

“They’re warriors, those two guys,” Green said.

“It rubs off on the team. Veteran guys that have been here for a long time. They’ve gone through some good times with the team. Also gone through some tougher times. They love Vancouver, they love the city and they love winning.

“They lead by example and it’s not just once in a while, it’s every day.”

Golden Knights’ forward Mark Stone said if the Canucks keep selling out to block shots, they’ll just have to find a way to shoot ‘em where they ain’t.

“We just gotta keep wearing ‘em down, wearing ‘em down, keep shooting, finding ways to get pucks through, having traffic in front,” Stone said.

“The quicker you move the puck, get them moving, that’s when you create [shooting] lanes.”

Knights’ forward Jonathan Marchessault said they also have to clean things up at their end of the ice. Pettersson, Bo Horvat and Tyler Toffoli torched them for four goals and eight points Tuesday, exposing goalie Robin Lehner to multiple point-blank scoring opportunities.

“We definitely gave them a lot of room,” Marchessault said. “Their skill players, they were coming into our zone like nothing. It was too easy for them.

“It’s on us to go back to how structured we were in the first game.”

The Canucks need to worry about shot fatigue on Markstrom.

Markstrom has started all 12 playoff games, getting pulled late in the Vegas Game 1 loss for Thatcher Demko. In that time, Vancouver has been outshot by an average of 36-28, and has yet to outshoot an opponent in the return-to-play tournament (they tied Minnesota in shots twice). The Golden Knights have put 79 shots on net in just two games.

Story continues below advertisement

The Knights, meanwhile, grappled with their second social media controversy in four days. After Tuesday’s loss, Marchessault got into a word war with people on his Instagram page, firing off some profane ripostes to those accusing him of exaggerating how hard he gets hit, known as diving.

“I just wanted to apologize, sincerely,” Marchessault said. “I think it was childish. It was immature, not professional.

“It won’t happen again.”

Golden Knight Marc-André Fleury, the regular season starting goalie, has seen very little ice time in the playoffs, prompting his agent to post a Twitter meme over the weekend of Fleury, on ice in his uniform, being literally stabbed in the back with broadsword bearing DeBoer’s name.

Lehner has started the first two games of the Canucks series, but the 5-2 loss raised questions on whether Fleury may be between the pipes in Game 3.

DeBoer declined to discuss the specific plan but said “both guys are going to play as we move forward here.”"

Belarus’s most celebrated writer called on Russia on Wednesday to help persuade President Alexander Lukashenko to negotiate, as she arrived for questioning in a criminal case accusing an opposition body of an illegal attempt to seize power.

“Now Lukashenko speaks only to Putin. We need him to speak to the people,” Svetlana Alexievich, winner of the 2015 Nobel Prize for Literature, told reporters outside the Investigative Committee, where she appeared for questioning.

“Maybe the world can help us, so that Lukashenko will negotiate with somebody,” she said. “We need the world to help, and maybe Russia.”

She emerged after a short time and said she had invoked her right not to testify against herself. She said there was no basis for the investigation, adding: “The more we stay together, the stronger we will be, and the greater chance we will have of making the authorities talk to us.”

Alexievich is one of dozens of public figures who formed the opposition Coordination Council last week, with the stated aim of negotiating a peaceful transition of power after an election the opposition says was rigged.

Lukashenko called it an attempt to seize power illegally. Two of its leaders were jailed on Tuesday.

At least 20 people were detained as police cleared Minsk’s Independence Square of hundreds of protesters on Wednesday evening, a Reuters witness said. Local media also reported detentions elsewhere in Minsk and the city of Brest.

At the suggestion of the Coordination Council, residents had also formed long queues in several parts of the capital to sign a petition demanding the resignation of lawmakers in a parliament that remains outwardly loyal to Lukashenko.

Rights groups said Belarusian police had rounded up dozens of protesters heading home from peaceful demonstrations on Tuesday after days in which the authorities exercised comparative restraint towards anti-government rallies.

Lukashenko has faced more than two weeks of mass demonstrations against his 26-year-old rule since the election, which official results say he won with 80 per cent of the vote. He denies electoral fraud and says the protests are funded from abroad.

Although Lukashenko has called the protesters “rats” and said he has given the order to clear them from the streets, police had been comparatively restrained in recent days, apparently wary of a crackdown that would add to public anger.

BEATINGS

In the early days of the protests, police beat demonstrators and many of those who were arrested emerged with heavy bruises and said they had been abused in detention. In her comments before questioning, Alexievich deplored that violence.

“For God’s sake let there not be blood spilled,” she said. “What we saw the first three days, when they turned people into meat, that is from last century.”

Rights group Spring listed more than 30 people it said had been arrested on Tuesday. In one typical account, a man wearing a red-and-white opposition flag on his shoulder was walking with his wife and young son, when an unmarked car pulled up, the group said. Two men in plain clothes jumped out, pushed the woman and child away, shoved the man into the car and drove off.

The Interior Ministry said police had detained 51 people for administrative violations after unsanctioned rallies on Tuesday. It typically reports dozens of such arrests per day.

Belarus has the closest cultural, economic and political ties to Russia of any former Soviet state. Russia has signalled its support for Lukashenko, including sending journalists to staff state television after workers quit in protest against what they described as orders to broadcast propaganda.

But it remains to be seen how long the Kremlin will stick by Lukashenko if his authority continues to ebb away. He has long had a difficult personal relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

A Russian government plane which is used to carry senior government officials, including the head of the FSB security service, landed in Minsk on Wednesday, flight tracking data showed.

This was its second such flight in just over a week. Reuters could not determine who was aboard.

Self-exiled Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said on Tuesday that 'intimidation will not work' after two other opposition leaders appeared in court as President Alexander Lukashenko's government pursues a crackdown on the few figures still at large. Reuters

Meltwater could undermine the walls of ice holding back Antarctica’s glaciers, scientists reported on Wednesday, a finding that underscores concern about the potential for a significant sea level rise.

The ice shelves, formed over thousands of years, serve as dams to prevent much of the continent’s snow and ice from flowing toward the ocean.

Scientists found that about 60 per cent of the ice shelf area is vulnerable to a process call hydrofracturing, in which meltwater seeps into the shelves’ crevasses, some of which are hundreds of meters deep, and triggers collapse.

“This meltwater is heavier than ice, so it can penetrate through the entire ice thickness, just like a knife,” said climate scientist Ching-Yao Lai at Colombia University.

It’s unclear how long such a process might take. Antarctic weather is highly variable, making it difficult for scientists to determine how much of a role is being played by human-caused climate change.

Lai said, however, that previous research suggested meltwater could cover the ice shelves in about a century.

The new study, published in the journal Nature, used AI to identify ice-fracture features in nearly 260 satellite images of 50 ice shelves across the continent. Those ice shelves surround about 75 per cent of the Antarctic coastline.

Finding vulnerabilities in the ice shelves buttressing the glaciers above was a surprise, Lai said.

“Previously, we thought there are going to be places vulnerable to hydrofracture, but that those places might not matter at all for the ice sheet,” Lai said.

Scientists fear that losing ice shelves to hydrofracturing will leave Antarctica’s ice sheets, which are as big as the United States and Mexico combined, a more direct pathway to the ocean. That could accelerate ice loss and contribute to sea level rise.

Story continues below advertisement

The latest reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change project that future sea levels will rise by more than a meter by 2100. However, scientists worry that a sudden collapse of these steep ice shelves could raise future sea levels dramatically. More than half of the world’s fresh water is locked into Antarctica’s ice.

Meanwhile, warming temperatures driven by climate change are also eating into glaciers and the ice sheet in the Arctic. Last month, Canada’s last intact ice shelf collapsed.

And Greenland’s ice sheet lost a record amount of mass last year, raising concerns the icy bulk is melting more quickly than anticipated. Greenland’s ancient ice sheet holds enough water to raise sea levels by at least 20 feet (6 meters) if it were to melt entirely.

In Antarctica, if “we start seeing the collapse of some of this ice that is there like a wall holding back everything behind it, it’s just going to accelerate the pace of sea level rise beyond what we’re probably predicting right now,” said Alexandra Isern, head of Antarctic studies for the U.S. National Science Foundation who was not involved in the study.

Once gone, the ice shelves wouldn’t be able to form again “in any time we’ll ever see,” Isern said. “It took a long time to make them, and it maybe isn’t going to take as long to get rid of them.”

Scientists say that, while governments should prepare for higher seas, there is still time to curb climate-warming emissions in order to slow the rate of sea level rise and avoid coastal catastrophes.

“There’s no ice on the planet that gets along well with warming air and warming ocean temperatures,” said glaciologist Twila Moon at the National Snow and Ice Data Center who was not involved in the study.

“These kinds of details and tools are helping us to narrow our range of being able to say what will happen in the future, given that humans follow any particular path.”

Glenn McGillivray is managing director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction, a not-for-profit research organization.

Unsettling news about climate change and the current state of the Arctic has been piling up as of late.

Last week saw ominous reports that Canada has lost its last permanent ice shelf. Using satellite photos, ice analysts noted that roughly more than 40 per cent of the 4,000-year-old Milne Ice Shelf, located on the northwestern edge of Ellesmere Island, broke off the main shelf into two very large and several smaller icebergs. The largest piece is nearly the size of Manhattan Island. The calving is thought to have occurred some time around July 30 or 31.

Story continues below advertisement

Glaciologists place the loss of the shelf squarely on the shoulders of climate change, with the Arctic facing summer temperatures this year that were about five degrees warmer than the 1980 to 2010 average. This, in a region already warming about three times faster than the global average.

And, in a study published Aug. 13 in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, researchers concluded that the warming Greenland ice sheet could pass the point of no return. The findings come after analysis of almost four decades of data indicated that even if climate change were to stop immediately, Greenland ice could continue to shrink under certain circumstances.

This news is sobering. It’s one thing to lose temporary sea ice. There is still a fair bit of annual variability with that – we have good years and bad years.

But loss of permanent ice (both sea and land) is another story.

Because loss of permanent ice is, well, permanent. Once gone, it doesn’t come back, and there are implications with that.

Other recent (bad) news includes a June report that permafrost at outposts in the Canadian Arctic is melting 70 years earlier than predicted, and a July study indicating that polar-bear populations could be wiped out by the end of the century if the current warming trend continues.

These stories are punctuated by the fact that Earth’s temperature is currently “warmer than at any time in the last 5,000 or more years.” The last time there was 415 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, Homo sapiens didn’t exist.

It’s clear as ice – the Arctic is more than just fraying at the edges. It is unravelling altogether.

But why should we care? After all, what possible effect can melting sea ice and exhausted, hungry polar bears have on the lives of those in the urban south?

Science is quickly connecting the dots between the loss of Arctic ice and severe weather.

Well-publicized science has made a solid connection between disappearing Arctic sea ice and a weakening, meandering jet stream that is contributing to what some have characterized as “stuck” weather patterns. The uncharacteristically long blocking patterns being linked to the weakening circulation of upper atmospheric winds in the Northern Hemisphere are being connected not only to the bitter North American winter of 2013-14 (remember the polar vortex?) and to the uncommonly cool summer of 2014, but also to extreme weather events, many of them involving prolonged periods of extreme heat or copious amounts of precipitation.

So while many used to think that changes in the Arctic brought by a warming climate served as nothing more than as a canary in the coal mine for the rest of us, we now have a better understanding – and appreciation – of how changes in the high north are directly affecting the lives of people hundreds and even thousands of kilometres away.

The reasons why natural hazards become disasters are many and complex to be sure. To boil it down to the base concepts, however, three main drivers can be identified: concentration of assets, the state of public infrastructure, and climate change.

Story continues below advertisement

On the latter, there is speculation that 2020 could go down as the warmest year on record, when compared against the 20th-century average.

It’s clear that climate change is not coming. It’s already here.

I can’t help but think that Earth’s systems can be equated to the systems that reside in each of us. Just as we have skeletal, muscular, nervous and circulatory systems, the Earth has its analogues.

Thus, we can no longer view a problem in the Arctic in isolation and consider the ramifications only on that region and to those who live and do business in it, just as we cannot view a problem with one part of our body in isolation.

We can say with strong confidence that loss of sea ice at the North Pole is beginning to affect the weather where large numbers of people reside.

So we must understand, the Arctic is not the canary in the coal mine – it is the coal mine.

Luckily, officials say that strong winds didn’t add fuel to a wildfire in Penticton, B.C. these past few days. An evacuation alert in the city for more than 3,600 properties remained in effect as of this weekend. The department has allowed 110 firefighters to return home to their respective communities after battling the blaze.

“We are seeing climate change in action,” says University of Alberta wildland fire professor Mike Flannigan. “The Fort McMurray fire was 1.5 to six times more likely because of climate change. The 2017 record-breaking B.C. fire season was seven to 11 times more likely because of climate change.”

The year before that, Christian Messier of the Université du Québec à Montréal told The Globe that “all simulation models predict that fire will increase due to climate change.”

A deeper dive

Solving the economy: Liberals say Canada needs a green, inclusive, equitable recovery. Can Chrystia Freeland deliver?

The recovery will be equitable. The recovery will be inclusive. The recovery will focus on jobs and growth. The recovery will be green.

I’ve reversed the flow there from how Chrystia Freeland phrased things in her first news conference as Canada’s Finance Minister last week. But why does what the Finance Minister says about the environment matter?

Because governments are about determining priorities and the Finance Minister is about determining spending priorities. If Canada’s economic recovery is to be “green,” Ms. Freeland will play a big role in determining how that spending gets allocated.

It’s also important because, as of now, Ms. Freeland and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are setting expectations that they’ll aggressively pursue all of these policy goals – and that, as Adam Radwanski and Patrick Brethour report, is a cause for encouragement among some observers and mounting concern among others.

Story continues below advertisement

Canada remains committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, but while the rest of the world is making big bets on stimulus packages to repair shattered economies, this country is still thinking about what direction is best. To be sure, as Adam has already reported, there are ideas on the table, but they have yet to be given anything close to a green light.

It’s also worth considering that earlier in the pandemic, Ms. Freeland appeared to be concerned that a focus on emissions reduction could cause a backlash among Canadians, particularly in Alberta, with more immediate economic needs.

Still, there are early signs that the kind of team effort Ms. Freeland brought to NAFTA negotiations will be brought to bear on climate change, such as the early promise from Ottawa and Alberta to pursue new hydrogen strategies.

A green recovery will require that kind of policy commitment – and a whole lot of money on the table.

Opinion and analysis

It’s clear as ice: The Arctic is unravelling

Glenn McGillivray: “We can say with strong confidence that loss of sea ice at the North Pole is beginning to affect the weather where large numbers of people reside. So we must understand, the Arctic is not the canary in the coal mine – it is the coal mine.”

John Ibbitson: “A well-run campaign and a thoughtful platform based on a return to fiscal responsibility, private-sector job creation, support for elder care as well as child care, continued robust immigration – with a greater emphasis on economic-class over family-class immigrants – help for the agriculture and natural resource sector – especially for oil and gas – improved education and entrepreneurial opportunities for First Nations, help for car commuters, and promises to co-operate with rather than confront provinces in fighting climate change, could go down well.”

Here’s what readers had to say

Pulled from one of this week’s letters to the editor, we curated some comments around environment

Roderick Benns from Lindsay, Ont.: The nitty-gritty of finance can be handled by talented bureaucrats. I would much rather have my Finance Minister get the big picture and, for me, Chrystia Freeland’s writings on inequality qualify.

With a Prime Minister open to thinking big and a Finance Minister who understands the impact of inequality on Canadian life, we could see the makings of a truly progressive legacy. Working with the NDP, this government has a chance to innovate with a green economy, basic income, pharma care, affordable housing and more publicly owned enterprises, so that profit stays with the people, not corporations.

Don Chapman from Surrey, B.C.: Re The Cash Bonfire At B.C.‘s Site C (Aug. 17): In the 1970s, I lived in the Peace River area of British Columbia when Site C was first proposed. I find The Globe’s editorial is right on the money.

However, while inferred in relation to mounting costs, what should not be forgotten are the engineering questions of whether the planned dam will even be technically viable. These are issues of dam stability, slumping reservoir banks and accumulation of sediment. Location continues to be an engineering nightmare; two earlier dams upriver are in completely different geography.

Story continues below advertisement

I hope there is the political courage to shut down construction – it always has been a dam too far.

Also, a comment sent in to Globe Climate from Bob Halliday:

“I wonder if it’s time for Canada to state that, as a matter of policy, it will no longer permit the export of thermal coal. This is particularly important given recent policy changes in Alberta. As well, the election of a Biden government in the U.S. would mean that Canada wouldn’t have to cope with a Trump tantrum over the matter as U.S. coal is exported through Canada because Pacific coast states won’t allow exports from U.S. soil.”

My name is Hunter McAlear – Mac for short. I’m a second-year student at the University of Saskatchewan in the College of Agriculture, majoring in animal sciences. I wanted to do something to help my community during the COVID-19 lockdowns. That’s how I became the CEO of Better Environments Inc, Meilleur Environnements Inc. We are an environmental not-for-profit organization that cleans up garbage in our established cities. Currently, they are Edmonton, Calgary, Ottawa and Toronto. The goal is to clean all our cities to help not only our citizens but, by extension, the environment surrounding our cities. To date, we have run more than 20 cleaning events across Canada, and cleaned more than 360 square kilometres in Edmonton alone. Even with lofty goals, I am genuinely encouraged and impressed with the exponential growth we’ve had in the last three months. Never could I have imagined just how many people care and actively want to help their community and environment. The biggest thing I have learned through all of this is you never know what you are capable of until you try.

Firefighters battling a blaze near Penticton, B.C., welcomed cooler weather on Sunday, authorities said as winds began pushing the flames away from the city in the Okanagan Valley.

The Christie Mountain fire has seen “minimal” growth over the weekend, B.C. Wildfire Service officials said.

“Slightly cooling temperatures will likely mean fairly safe fire conditions, so that’s good news,” said Greg Jonuk, a fire information officer.

Mr. Jonuk said more than 200 firefighters and a total of 16 helicopters were fighting the wildfire, which remained roughly 20 square kilometres in size.

Strong winds over the weekend had failed to fuel the blaze, but more than 3,700 properties in Penticton remain on an evacuation alert.

Mr. Jonuk wouldn’t rule out a threat to structures but said there is some optimism about how the fire is being managed.

“The conditions are trending favourably,” he said.

The fire is burning on rocky, sloped terrain, making it hard for ground crews and heavy equipment to tackle.

The region also remains under an Environment Canada special weather statement warning of smoky skies caused by the fire.

Meanwhile in B.C.‘s Slocan Valley, 305 homes have been issued an evacuation alert over growing concerns about the spread of the nearby Talbot Creek wildfire.

OFFICIAL PRESIDENTIAL WEBSITE/Reuters

Iran has agreed to allow inspectors in to two sites where the country is suspected of having stored or used undeclared nuclear material, the UN atomic watchdog agency said Wednesday.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran was “voluntarily providing the IAEA with access to the two locations specified by the IAEA and facilitating the IAEA verification activities to resolve the issues.”

It said in a joint statement with Iran that the dates for the inspections had been agreed, but did not say when they would take place.

The inspections would resolve a months-long impasse between Iran and the IAEA, and the announcement came as the agency’s Director General Rafael Grossi was on his way home to Vienna after his first visit to Tehran since taking over the post in December.

Iran had been resisting providing access to the sites, which are thought to be from the early 2000s, before it signed the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, maintaining the IAEA had no legal basis to visit them.

The head of Iran’s nuclear agency, Ali Akbar Salehi, confirmed that Iran had agreed to the inspections, saying “this will bring the case to an end.”

“We are loyal to conventions and our commitments,” he said, adding that he hoped the agreement would open a new chapter between Iran and the IAEA based upon “good intentions and mutual acceptance.”

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who on Wednesday met with the IAEA chief, said Grossi’s visit had produced a “good agreement that can help for moving on a correct and proper path and achieve the final resolution of problems.”

As the U.S. and others continue to put more pressure on Iran, Rouhani urged the IAEA to continue its “independence, impartiality and professionalism.”

Grossi told IAEA board members in March that it had “identified a number of questions related to possible undeclared nuclear material and nuclear-related activities at three locations that have not been declared by Iran” and had been pressing for access.

Story continues below advertisement

In its report in June, the agency said it had determined that one site had undergone “extensive sanitization and levelling” in 2003 and 2004 and there would be no verification value in inspecting it. It said Iran has blocked access to the other two locations, one of which was partially demolished in 2004 and the other at which the agency observed activities “consistent with efforts to sanitize” the facility from July 2019 onward.

At the same time, it emphasized that Iran had been fully providing access to sites agreed upon in the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, with the U.S., Russia, China, Germany, France and Britain.

The nuclear deal promised Iran economic incentives in return for the curbs on its nuclear program. President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal unilaterally in 2018, saying it needed to be renegotiated.

Since then, Iran has since slowly violated the restrictions to try and pressure the remaining nations to increase the incentives to offset new, economy-crippling U.S. sanctions.

The ultimate goal of the deal is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb. Since the U.S. withdrawal, Iran has stockpiled enough uranium to produce a weapon, although the government in Tehran insists it has no such goal and that its atomic program is only for producing energy.

The other members of the accord have been struggling to keep the deal alive saying, among other things, that even though Iran has violated many parts of the deal, the ability for inspectors to continue to visit its nuclear sites is critical.

Gelareh Zadeh speaks about the first time she observed a brain operation the same way one might describe discovering a precious jewel. As a medical student in the early 1990s, she recalls being mesmerized by a skillful neurosurgeon delicately working on the unruly snarl of blood vessels of an arteriovenous malformation.

“It was so tantalizing,” she says, explaining how the experience put her on the path to choosing it as her specialty. “Technically, it’s really a beautiful field.”

A mentor sealed it for her. “He said to me: ‘We need more women in this field. We need to have a kinder field and we need more gentle people – and you need to go into neurosurgery.’ ”

Almost three decades later, Zadeh is shaping the future of the medical specialty in this country. On Sept. 1, she steps into the role of the Dan family chair of neurosurgery at the University of Toronto, becoming the first woman to helm one of the largest neurosurgical programs in the world and the first female neurosurgery chair in Canada.

During her 10-year term, an important part of her job will be to steer the training of the next generation of neurosurgeons and to manage the three dozen or so who hold positions at the university and work across four hospitals in the city.

The number of women in the field is growing but is nowhere near closing the gender gap. While the ratio of women to men is roughly equal in some medical specialties, such as pediatric general surgery or infectious diseases, men far outnumber women in neurosurgery. According to 2018 data from the Canadian Medical Association, only 37 of 333 neurosurgeons in Canada were women.

Zadeh says her intention was not primarily to become a role model for women. Nevertheless, she recognizes that her appointment sends a signal to students and the medical community that diversity is fostered and promoted at the university.

Just as importantly, she says, it sends the message that individuals can approach this field and profession with their own vision.

“It doesn’t have to be what historically has always been perceived to be the ‘white middle-aged guy’ who can do this job,” she says.

Pandemic aside, 2020 has so far been an auspicious year for Zadeh. In January, she gave birth to her second child with husband Randall Strank, a physician. In the spring she added another new title, division head of neurosurgery at University Health Network, to her list of appointments, which also include medical director of the Krembil Brain Institute, senior scientist at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and president of the Society for Neuro-Oncology.

This summer, she and her team published a study in Nature Medicine demonstrating the potential of a simple blood test to diagnose and classify brain tumours. The implications could be enormous, she explains, as it could mean avoiding the invasive brain procedure of having to biopsy tumours.

Yet Zadeh, who was born in Iran, says her life could have turned out very differently had her family not immigrated to Canada.

As the only child of an economist father and nuclear chemist mother, she spent several years of her childhood in England, where her mother was studying, before returning to Iran just as the Iranian Revolution erupted. She has stark memories of the unrest and the war with Iraq that followed – of bombs, shootings and people being stoned to death near her school.

Escaping the strife was “just pure luck,” she says. “Sometimes I think you need a bit of luck in life to change the course of your life.”

A scholarship allowed her mother to bring her family back to England on a one-year visa, where they applied to immigrate to Canada, one of the few countries at the time that was accepting Iranian immigrants. The family arrived in Winnipeg on an icy Boxing Day in 1988.

Zadeh attended medical school at the University of Manitoba, where she started her neurosurgery residency. She earned her PhD at the University of Toronto and went on to study radiotherapy at the Grey Institute in England before returning to Toronto in 2008.

Her excellence in clinical practice, research, teaching and administrative leadership make her “eminently suited for and capable” of taking on the role of neurosurgery chair, said James Rutka, who held the position from 1999 to 2010. Currently the department chair of surgery at the University of Toronto, Rutka led the search committee to fill the role. Zadeh beat out stiff competition from across North America, he said.

For female neurosurgeons she has mentored, now working in Canada and beyond, Zadeh has already helped create a kinder, gentler field.

“She sets a high expectation and then inspires people to rise to it,” said Karolyn Au, assistant professor of neurosurgery at the University of Alberta.

In Jakarta, Selfy Oswari is applying what she learned as a clinical fellow in Toronto to her work at the Indonesia National Brain Centre.

“It’s not an easy process and it’s very tiring. But when I remember Dr. Zadeh’s dedication, hard work and determination, it helps me refocus on my purpose,” Oswari said. “I hope some day I can become a good mentor like her.”

Tenet

Written and directed by Christopher Nolan

Christopher Nolan Starring John David Washington, Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki

John David Washington, Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki Classification PG; 150 minutes

rating 3.5 out of 4 stars `

“Don’t try to understand it.” Those words are uttered early in Christopher Nolan’s new genre-crossing extravaganza Tenet, and they are directed at the film’s heroes as much as they are at the audience. Tenet is not so much a decipherable thriller as it is an extreme exercise in reverse-engineered narrative incomprehensibility – the cinematic equivalent of a half-baked pretzel, its goopy symmetrical loops superficial yet delicious all the same. We’re never meant to know what exactly is going on at any one moment, but we will be – we must be – entertained by the overwhelming nonsense of it all. Death by disorientation. Life by explosions.

This all helps turn Tenet into the most Christopher Nolan-y thing that Christopher Nolan has ever made. In addition to a brain-bending conceit that makes Inception’s nightmare logic seem like a child‘s simple daydream (and which I’ll attempt to summarize in a moment, once I brush up on my quantum physics), Tenet arrives like a 150-minute supercut of Nolan quirks and quarks.

There are spectacular action scenes filmed in exotic international locales, all captured in gloriously intimidating IMAX. There are never-smiling men engaging in acts of ultra-serious violence. An obsession with the super-wealthy. A booming score so floor-shaking that it drowns out almost all the dialogue. A plot point fixed on the separation of a parent and child. And while there are no dead wives à la Nolan’s Following, Memento, The Prestige, The Dark Knight Rises, Inception and Interstellar, there is an abused wife. Oh, and Michael Caine is here, too.

If you detest Christopher Nolan movies, you already know that Tenet is not for you. But if you love Christopher Nolan movies – if you can’t help but embrace his knack for slick spectacle at the same time that your throat tightens up with the realization of what chunky plot nonsense he is asking you to once again swallow – then Tenet is a divine offering from the movie gods in these troubled times. Myself, I’ll continue to pray at the altar of the almighty madman from Westminster, conscious of the fact that I have no one but myself to blame for such ludicrous zealotry.

At least, though, it is original ludicrousness. Focusing on the concept of “inversion” – which is like time travel, but not really – Tenet takes an idea that could be conjured up by a stoner in cargo shorts and refines it into the language of a gent sporting a Brioni three-piece. Basically, the film posits that objects, even people, can have their entropy reversed, which in Tenet’s case means that bullets can fly back into a gun’s chamber, and that car chases can involve one vehicle ramming forward while the other speeds backwards. Whatever inversion is, it is up to Tenet’s nameless CIA agent hero (John David Washington) to figure out who is receiving backwards intelligence and inverted weapons from the future, in the hopes of preventing a complete erasure of the present.

Somehow, this involves Washington’s protagonist (who is called The Protagonist in the film’s official credits) going on a scavenger mission across the globe, Carmen Sandiego-style. Quickly, he comes across a Russian arms dealer (Kenneth Branagh), the arms dealer’s estranged art-appraiser wife (Elizabeth Debicki), a shady-slick operative (Robert Pattinson) in the Tom-Hardy-in-Inception mould and a Goya painting that may or may not be a forgery and whose MacGuffin-like presence in the film Nolan may or may not fully understand himself.

Listen: So very much of Tenet does not make sense. Not in a “You have to watch it two or three times to get it” kind of way. It is complete ridiculousness, full stop. Just one example: We’re told late in the game that anyone who undergoes inversion – that is, whose body moves backward in the flow of time after they hop inside a mysterious giant centrifuge – must wear an oxygen mask because their lungs cannot handle the inverted air. Okay, whatever, fine, yes. But then one character spends a large amount of their inverted time breathing free and clear. If you were frustrated by Inception’s fuzzy rules (why isn’t the third level of Cobb’s dream affected by the atmosphere of the second?) then Tenet’s playbook will lead to you to fruitlessly shout at the heavens, asking why hast Christopher Nolan forsaken thou.

Open this photo in gallery The film features an abundance of explosive set-pieces. Warner Bros.

But that doesn’t mean Tenet isn’t still one hell of a ride. Approximately every five minutes, Nolan unleashes a new and extravagant set-piece of magnificent destruction, most of it CGI-free. He invades opera houses, destroys highways and blows up a real-deal 747 jet just for the hell of it. It is wonderful and visceral tentpole artistry executed on a grand scale. Everything just looks so ... expensive. Clean and sharp and polished, but with an air of effortlessness, too, as if wholesale chaos was the most natural thing in Nolan’s world. Every dollar that Warner Bros. tossed the director’s way is right up there on the screen. It is Succession crossed with Inception. It is exceptionally rich filmmaking.

This helps gloss over the movie’s other flaws. The Protagonist is as much a cipher as his name suggests, and there is little point in investing any emotional energy into whether he lives or dies. Debicki’s character is a collection of “I just want my kids back!” clichés. And, as much as I genuinely enjoyed Ludwig Goransson’s assaultive score, which successfully out-Zimmers Hans Zimmer, Nolan once again decides to muddy his film’s sound mix so that the soundtrack overwhelms the dialogue, some of which seems mighty pertinent to untangling the knotty plot.

But, well, Nolan is going to Nolan. In an artistic marketplace that forces blockbuster filmmakers to favour intellectual property over even a sliver of originality, the director manages to find new and exciting ways to enthrall and beguile. He still has a perfect eye for casting (Pattinson and Branagh delight and surprise), and everything overwhelms in just the right way.

Although it seems as if the future of Hollywood rests upon the film’s shoulders – there has been no discussion about moviegoing in the age of COVID-19 that has not involved Nolan – and although the movie contains so many unintentional reminders of the world we’re living in, including a scene where an entire theatre’s audience is placed in harm’s way for simply enjoying a night out, Tenet offers a complete and magnificent escape. Just don’t try to understand it.

Debora MacKenzie is the author of COVID-19: The Pandemic that Never Should Have Happened and How to Stop the Next One.

In a few months, the Northern Hemisphere will head into flu season – and COVID-19 will still be here. How do we handle both at once?

More than six months in to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we are all used to hearing that nothing is certain. But here are two things that are as close to certain as infectious diseases ever get.

Story continues below advertisement

One: COVID-19 will not just disappear by winter.

Two: We will also have a flu epidemic this winter, like we always do. The big uncertainty now keeping epidemiologists and hospital managers awake is this: How on earth will we manage both at once?

Just ordinary flu, and the other winter viruses, will be bad enough alongside COVID-19. What happens if flu pulls one of its regular identity switches, and stages a pandemic of its own, this winter or next year, while economies and health care systems are still reeling from COVID-19?

It is all too possible. In the past six weeks, both Chinese and European researchers have warned that strains of potentially pandemic flu have emerged in pigs, while bird flu, which hit headlines in the 2000s, has never gone away.

But there is a ray of hope. We may not have a COVID-19 vaccine yet, but we may soon get one to handle the flu.

Every fall a series of viruses rage through the world’s temperate zones. First a common cold, rhinovirus, sets in as small children go back to school and exchange mucus. As that subsides, respiratory syncytial virus or RSV, the biggest cause of pneumonia in babies, takes over. Then the annual wave of flu sweeps in from East Asia.

Having one of them often stops you being infected by the others, but none of them seem to deter COVID-19. Doctors in New York and California have found all the usual autumn viruses in coronavirus patients. Wuhan doctors found patients with both flu and COVID-19 were not more likely to die, but did have more heart damage and earlier runaway inflammation, the late-stage immune reaction that kills many COVID-19 victims.

The coming Northern Hemisphere winter will be the world’s first full-on collision between these epidemics. In the Southern Hemisphere, with winter now under way, anti-COVID-19 lockdowns and physical distancing have slowed flu to a trickle. When Hong Kong locked down for COVID-19 last February, it stopped its continuing flu epidemic in its tracks.

But Northern Hemisphere countries such as Canada are unlikely to return to such strict lockdowns this winter, so we will get them all full on. And because of the way flu travels in its yearly excursions, less flu in the south will not mean less flu in the north this winter, says Colin Russell of the University of Amsterdam.

The problem for doctors this winter will be diagnosing people with a fever and cough, as those are typical in both flu and COVID-19. Moreover both viruses make exactly the same people especially sick and likely to seek medical care: people over the age of 60, or with medical conditions involving inflammation, such as high blood pressure, diabetes or obesity.

Hospitals can be swamped just in a bad flu year. On average, 12,200 Canadians are hospitalized due to flu every winter, and 3,500 die. Now there will be coronavirus cases adding to the flu cases, and people with both will be more seriously ill.

Managing the different infections will be difficult. Medical staff can be vaccinated for flu, but they need full personal protective equipment (PPE) to deal with COVID-19. They may need full PPE for every patient until test results allow them to separate people with just flu. Even that will take new resources, as we don’t normally test all incoming flu patients.

Tim Sly, an epidemiologist at Ryerson in Toronto, sees two problems. “Having folks with flu lining up at the testing centre with COVID suspects,” he says, means more people will need testing to find the COVID-19 cases. And people may swap viruses while waiting.

On the other hand, “People with early COVID may think they only have a cold or flu,” so they may not get tested or isolate. “All the more reason to get the flu shot this season as soon as it’s available.” That alone poses logistical problems: COVID-19 precautions such as physical distancing will be needed by staff administering the shots.

The vaccine can help. Danuta Skowronski, an epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia, reports that this year 60 per cent of Canadians who got their flu shot last fall were protected.

But this is variable. Flu constantly evolves, so you need a new vaccine every year. And as there is little profit in them, vaccine makers still mostly use a technique from the 1940s, which takes six months. That means they had to predict last February what flu would circulate this winter, and what vaccine virus to grow. Sometimes they are right, sometimes less so.

This also means that, even though we should vaccinate more people than usual to minimize the dual impact of flu and COVID-19, manufacturers cannot make more vaccine now. Canada recommends flu vaccination for everyone over six months old, but only 42 per cent of Canadian adults got it in 2018-19.

Vaccine stocks ordered for this winter will reflect this demand. This year people could well want far more, but there will be no more vaccine.

And all bets are off if a flu pandemic hits. This is when a human flu emerges that has proteins from an animal flu that most humans have not encountered before, as virologists fear may happen with pig flu in China or Europe.

People have far less immunity to pandemic flu than to normal winter flu, and it can be much more deadly. Existing vaccines normally don’t affect it at all.

One vaccine could fix these problems: a universal flu vaccine that immunizes you to small bits of the virus that are the same in all flu, ordinary or pandemic. In theory, one shot should immunize you to whatever flu turns up, while the vaccine can be stockpiled for emergencies when demand increases, unlike any vaccine we have now.

Many companies are working on these, but there has been little funding for the big expensive trials needed to see if they work, as no company sees much profit in one-shot flu vaccines. But an Israeli company, BiondVax, got European Union support for the first-ever big trial of a candidate universal flu vaccine last year, and will announce the results soon. If it worked, the company says it can build production plants and churn out large amounts of vaccine, quickly.

We need it quickly. A flu pandemic is inevitable and can happen any time. More immediately, with more flu vaccine we could stop more people at high risk from COVID-19 from also getting ordinary winter flu, and keep our health care systems from buckling under severe cases of both viruses – if not in time for this winter, then perhaps next year.

With the world frantically working on COVID-19 vaccines, flu may seem a distraction. But the way the two could collide this winter shows starkly that the COVID-19 problem isn’t about just one virus. It is about our vulnerability as a tightly interconnected, global species to infectious disease, both new and familiar.

We need to seriously up our game every way we can to fight back.

The B.C. Ministry of Education will financially compensate Grade 12 students affected last year when more than 18,000 incorrect exam scores were released.

Roughly half the exam scores were higher than they should have been and the other half lower, causing chaos for thousands of students, many intent on securing admission to postsecondary education.

According to a report by B.C. ombudsperson Jay Chalke, more than 100,000 potentially incorrect transcripts were obtained by postsecondary institutions and others before the marks were corrected.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Chalke’s report, released Thursday, includes a recommendation the ministry establish a compensation program by Dec. 31 for students affected by the errors in exam tabulation – a first in the 30 years that the system has been in place.

The ombudsperson said the compensation initiative should provide financial payments for individuals who can demonstrate financial loss incurred from exam tabulation errors, and not be limited to students whose grades were adjusted up or down.

“It’s an important principle at stake. The important principle is the thing we teach children in school, which is when you make a mistake, you stand up and fess up and make it right,” he said in an interview.

“Even if there is one [student], it’s the appropriate principle to stand up for, that when government makes a mistake that harms a young person, they should make it right. To the extent that the person is out financially, that is the nature of the harm.”

In a letter included with the report, D. Scott MacDonald, the deputy education minister, said the ministry will implement the compensation recommendation by Dec. 31.

“The ministry’s internal resources are currently fully committed to addressing the issues related to COVID-19 and supporting school districts and independent school authorities as they prepare to restart school after a lengthy disruption in the spring of 2020,” writes Mr. MacDonald.

“Upon the safe restart of B.C. schools, we will shift our resources to addressing this recommendation on the time frame noted above.”

Mr. Chalke said the situation affected English, communications and French exams, with a technical error at the ministry level when tabulating exam reports into their systems.





“It was disappointing for us to see that the ministry was aware that the exam results were wrong and yet they continued in both their public statement to postsecondary institutions and to the public to indicate they were investigating the exam results as opposed to indicating that they were wrong.”

In his report, Mr. Chalke says, “The ministry did not have in place the checks and balances that are cornerstones of good public administration.”





Mr. Chalke writes that ministry statements to the public were “misleading” and played down the situation and extent of the problem rather than informing students and their families that incorrect marks had been issued to multiple postsecondary institutions, naming those institutions and notifying the students and institutions immediately.

The ombudsperson said the ministry implied publicly that postsecondary institutions across North America had reassured students they would not be affected, “when, in fact, at the time the ministry made this statement only one institution had given that assurance.”

“This report is an absolute bombshell as it shows the NDP government knowingly misled the public and jeopardized countless students’ academic futures,” Dan Davies, the education critic for the Opposition BC Liberals, and a former teacher, said in a statement.

On Thursday, the ministry acknowledged “this situation was stressful for students and their parents when it happened,” but that in August, 2019, it conducted its own internal review and began updating its processes ahead of Mr. Chalke’s investigation.





The ministry said, in a statement, that it has addressed four of Mr. Chalke’s recommendations, and is enacting the others by the end of the year.

The ministry also said it reviewed or remarked exams as requested, confirmed they are correct, and has not received any follow-ups or complaints from students or parents since August, 2019. “We’ve learned from this and have taken steps to ensure it doesn’t happen again. ""

Andrew Medichini/The Associated Press

Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne has expressed cautious optimism after a lengthy and unexpected meeting with his Chinese counterpart that consular services may be restored for two Canadians charged with espionage and imprisoned in China.

Mr. Champagne met Wang Yi Tuesday night in his Rome hotel for 90 minutes – their longest face-to-face meeting and first direct talks since they met with each other in Japan last November (though they did meet informally in mid-February in Germany). The Rome meeting had not been scheduled before the two foreign ministers arrived in Italy and was arranged at the last minute by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

In an interview Wednesday morning before his flight to Lebanon, Mr. Champagne said he used the meeting to request the restoration of consular services for the detained Canadians, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, and their release. While he insisted there was no breakthrough on the “two Michaels” file, he said there was some progress on the consular services front.

“It was a productive meeting, and so we are going to continue the engagement,” he said. “We talked about the lack of access to the detainees by consular officials, we talked about lack of access by the families … We have agreed to put consular officials on both sides to talk to see what can be done, [and] we hope there will be a positive outcome.”

Mr. Champagne said he reminded Mr. Wang, who has been China’s Foreign Minister since 2013, that the denial of consular services for Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig is a violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. “We obviously had a number of things where we disagreed profoundly, but to the extent that we can talk, I think it’s a sign of progress,” Mr. Champagne said. “This has been key to our discussions – to make sure the detainees have access to their loved ones.”

He said he also asked for clemency for three Canadian nationals sentenced to death in China on drug-related charges.

Mr. Wang was in Rome to kick off a European charm offensive, his first since the pandemic shut down most of the European Union in March. Mr. Champagne is on a whirlwind European and Middle Eastern tour that includes visits to Geneva, Rome and Beirut.

Mr. Wang warned Italy and the rest of the EU to ignore U.S. attempts to build a transatlantic alliance against China. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser Robert O’Brien have used recent trips to the EU to stir up anti-Chinese sentiment. The United States also wants EU countries to ban the use of Huawei equipment in their 5G networks.

“On the so-called new Cold War … China has no intention in launching any new Cold War,” Mr. Wang said in Rome. “We are resolutely opposed to any promotion of a new Cold War.”

Mr. Champagne would not say whether Huawei, China’s premier telecommunications company, was raised in his discussions with Mr. Wang.

Relations between China and Canada began to fray in December, 2018, when Canadian police arrested Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer, on a U.S. extradition warrant. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Spavor, a businessman, and Mr. Kovrig, a former diplomat, were arrested. Citing the pandemic, Chinese authorities have not permitted diplomatic access to the men since mid-January.

Mr. Kovrig is being held in a detention facility in Beijing; Mr. Spavor in Dangong, on the border with North Korea. The two Canadians face the imminent possibility of court proceedings. They have been charged with state secrets violations punishable by life in prison, and conviction rates in China are exceedingly high. No information on their trial dates has been released.

In Rome, Mr. Champagne met with Italian Foreign Affairs Minister Luigi Di Maio and talked about strengthening trade and investment ties between the two countries under CETA – the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. They also discussed the agenda for the 2021 G20 summit, which is being held in Italy.

In Lebanon, Mr. Champagne will be meeting with Lebanese President Michel Aoun, who is overseeing the rebuilding of Beirut after the Aug. 4 explosion of some 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate in its port. Canada has pledged $30-million in recovery and humanitarian assistance.

Canada has also offered to send RCMP investigators to assist the French national police and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation in probing the circumstances that led to the explosion, which killed at least 181 people, including two Canadians, and left about 300,000 homeless. Mr. Champagne said he will discuss the parameters and direction of the investigation with Mr. Aoun. “Our involvement would be to get to the bottom of things, to have truth, justice, transparency,” he said.

He added that Canada may send wheat to Lebanon, which lost most of its stored grain in the explosion. “We made the offer,” he said. “The Red Cross there needs supplies.”

Hatfield United States Courthouse in Portland, Ore. The Associated Press

The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on Wednesday alleging agents sent by President Donald Trump to protect a federal courthouse targeted by Black Lives Matter protesters used excessive force and illegal detentions to rob protesters of their freedom of speech and assembly.

The lawsuit also alleges that the acting director of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Chad Wolf, did not have the authority to send more than 100 agents to Portland because he was improperly appointed. The federal agents exceeded the limits of their authority, making illegal arrests and using tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper spray and other tactics to squelch the protests, the lawsuit alleges.

“Our clients are individuals and organizations that gathered peacefully in downtown Portland to support Black Lives Matter after the killing of George Floyd and so many others at the hands of the police,” said Jeremy Sacks, an attorney working with the ACLU. “But they were met by violence from the federal police forces intent on squelching the protesters message and their constitutional rights – all in aid of the president’s political agenda.”

DHS did not immediately reply to a request for comment Wednesday. The lawsuit names that agency, as well as Wolf and Trump.

Plaintiffs include three military veterans, a college professor, several Black Lives Matter activists and a man who alleges he was snatched off a street blocks from the federal courthouse by unidentified agents for no reason.

“I still haven’t fully come to terms with what it means that I was kidnapped by my government,” Mark Pettibone said in a statement. “People need to know what happened to me and the government needs to be held accountable so that what happened to me doesn’t happen to someone else.”

Almost all the plaintiffs allege physical injuries from getting hit by metal tear gas canisters, rubber bullets, pepper spray and other chemical irritants. Some were treated at hospitals, where they got multiple stitches and received CAT scans to check for more serious internal injuries, the lawsuit says.

A video of plaintiff and Navy veteran Christopher David’s encounter with U.S. agents outside the Portland courthouse circulated widely on social media. It showed one agent hitting David with a baton and another dousing him in the face with pepper spray. David suffered two broken bones in his hand.

The U.S. Department of Justice has said it is conducting an internal review of the incident.

Also among the plaintiffs are two groups that have organized protesters: the Black Millennial Movement and Rose City Justice.

“Federal officers had no place and no right to further exacerbate our environment in our community with force and violence and brutality and there is real attention that needs to be focused on the brutality from law enforcement,” said Shanice Clarke, of the Black Millennial Movement.

Wednesday’s lawsuit is the third filed by ACLU in Portland since nightly protests began after the May 25 death of George Floyd, the Black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him by the neck.

Two previous lawsuits targeted the federal agents’ actions against members of the press and legal observers and against street medics who treat protesters hurt by tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets.

Portland has seen nearly 90 days of nightly unrest following Floyd’s death, including two weeks in July when thousands of protesters clashed with U.S. agents sent to protect the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse.

If you drive around the farming communities of Southern Ontario, you’ll see workers in the fields toiling under the hot sun. Their exhausting work puts food on Canadian tables. It also puts food on tables in Mexico, Jamaica and across the Caribbean. These front line workers ensure we don’t go hungry, particularly during the pandemic; they are critical to our food security.

Almost all migrant workers arriving in Canada were tested and confirmed to be free of COVID-19. Through no fault of their own, hundreds have contracted the virus through community transmission after they arrived, and three have died. The virus spread quickly because of their cramped living quarters and inadequate working areas.

Canada has been a leader in establishing international standards on migration, but our country’s treatment of migrant workers runs counter to its international commitments and threatens to damage its global reputation.

In 2018, Canada endorsed the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration at the United Nations. The Global Compact is a framework of principles, objectives and actions to strengthen migration standards and protect the rights of migrants. It applies to both sending and receiving countries, and by endorsing it, Canada made a commitment to implementing those standards.

Over two years of negotiations, Canada was recognized as a leader by the UN. Canada identified and proposed concrete solutions to global migration challenges. It worked closely with civil society organizations and built partnerships that crossed the world. Canada was regularly asked by the Global Compact organizers to mediate with countries that were backpedalling on migration issues and to assist in garnering international commitment for the compact’s implementation.

Canada’s accomplishments are doubly impressive given the rise of populist movements around the world. In the U.K., the Brexit side won in part because of a campaign against migration, and in the United States, President Donald Trump ran on an anti-migration platform, subsequently pulling out of the Global Compact. Globally, anti-migrant sentiment has been growing. Even in Canada, a misinformation campaign claimed the compact would impinge on sovereignty and encourage mass migration.

Now COVID-19 has put a spotlight on Canada’s own policies. The outbreaks among farm workers have exposed the pre-existing weaknesses in how we treat these migrants.

For decades, Canada’s migrant worker programs have been plagued with vulnerabilities to abuse, exploitation, workplace injuries and deplorable living conditions. This vulnerability is particularly true for those on work permits tied to only one employer. Migrant workers risk losing their jobs and livelihoods if they raise complaints.

Implementing the Global Compact can help Canada do better.

Story continues below advertisement

The compact’s underlying, non-negotiable principle is respect for human rights, including labour rights. It also promotes partnerships among governments, employers and migrant worker organizations. It stresses that policies should “not create, exacerbate or unintentionally increase vulnerabilities.” Following the premise of the compact means that including migrant workers as partners is an important first step. For example, working directly with migrants early in the pandemic to understand why they feared COVID-19 tests could have reduced the number of outbreaks.

In adopting the compact, states committed “to adapt options and pathways for regular migration in a manner that facilitates labour mobility and decent work.” In order to do so, one action outlined in the compact is to provide “flexible, convertible and non-discriminatory visa and permit options.” In line with the compact, Canada’s migrant worker programs should move from providing migrants with employer-specific visas to open or occupation-specific visas or even permanent residency.

Not tying workers to one employer reduces the risk of exploitation and abuse. Furthermore, not fearing reprisals, migrants may more often report violations and access services, thus recognizing their rights. Canada moved toward open visas with last year’s regulatory change allowing migrant workers at risk of workplace abuse to apply for an open visa, usually for one year. However, the onus is still on the migrant worker in a vulnerable situation.

Migration, and specifically the impact of COVID-19 on migrant workers, is a global story as much as it is a national one. What we do at home affects how we are seen elsewhere. Recently, Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne noted that Canada would “continue to play a leadership role and continue to defend and promote our values and principles around the world.” If Canada is committed to a global leadership role, it must improve its own standards before advocating to others the importance of principles and values.

By truly improving migration standards at home and acting on the international commitments it has made to protect the most vulnerable, Canada will build healthier communities and stronger economies – at home and abroad.

Short may be sweet, but the world of short-length filmmaking can leave a bitter taste in your mouth. Faced with little recognition, crippling costs and the sometimes futile attempts to win over traditional industry gatekeepers, short filmmakers have long had a rough go of it – and that was before the pandemic painted them into an even tighter corner.

To help ease the new (and old) burdens placed on emerging directors, Canadian filmmaker Sophy Romvari is launching Exquisite Shorts, a biweekly online series on Vimeo that aims to put the power of programming in the auteur’s hands. The concept for the online program, which riffs off the literary game known as Exquisite Corpse, goes like this: The first short will be selected by Romvari from a pool of submissions. The next will be chosen by the filmmaker of the first film selected. And on it goes throughout the rest of the year, with the model avoiding the singular perspective of festival programmers that can result in a sort of tunnel vision of sensibilities, while encouraging discovery and dialogue between artists at the same time.

“Exquisite Shorts is the culmination of many conversations between other filmmakers and me, regarding possible alternatives to the current film industry landscape, particularly for short or emerging filmmakers,” says the Toronto-based Romvari, whose shorts have previously premiered at TIFF, Hot Docs, Sheffield Doc Fest and the True/False documentary festival in Columbia, Mo. “It’s a small-scale attempt to address some of the most common concerns I’ve heard voiced, and which I have also experienced myself.”

This is why a core element of the program is fair compensation for participating filmmakers ($200 a short, covering both the screening fee and curation fee). To achieve this, Romvari, whose new short Still Processing will premiere at TIFF in September, is in the midst of a $10,000 Indiegogo campaign. The funds raised will also help cover first-year costs of the program and make the programming freely accessible to online audiences.

Cait MacIntosh/Handout

Romvari, who has been developing the project for the past year, says that the idea evolved from the initial concept of an in-person screening series at Toronto’s Revue Cinema. Today, though, she feels the virtual landscape is a safer, more accessible forum.

“I had considered making the online screening series a pay-per-view scenario, or even a Patreon subscriber-based series, but ultimately I realized that two things were important to me: that the filmmakers get paid, and that the content is free for all to enjoy,” Romvari says. “It is quite uncommon, particularly as a short filmmaker, to be paid to exhibit your work. And [the fundraising campaign] will also allow the program to have a very accessible submission fee of just $5. Regular submission fees for film festivals usually hover around $35-80 per short film, so another priority is to maintain a low financial bar of entry, so artists don’t feel excluded due to their financial situations.”

And while the filmmaker is hoping to create an alternative to the traditional festival landscape, she doesn’t view Exquisite Shorts as a replacement.

“I absolutely love attending film festivals, and there is nothing quite like the experience of seeing your work on the big screen. It’s an experience I hope many filmmakers will continue to have once it’s safe to do so,” she says. “Regardless of the future of in-person film festivals, I see Exquisite Shorts as an alternative that functions alongside film festivals, and can even work in tandem quite nicely. For example, there will be far fewer restrictions on the kinds of films that can be submitted, ie: no premiere status. That means a film could not only have screened at other festivals, but it can also be something that was made years ago that has never been seen.

“It will be a home for filmmakers whose work does not meet industry regulations and who simply want their films to be considered for something a little different.”

First Person is a daily personal piece submitted by readers. Have a story to tell? See our guidelines at tgam.ca/essayguide.

I’m not prone to bouts of sentimentality. In my family, anything reaching in that direction was denounced as sentimental, the word said with a sour turn of lip. The epithet was used whenever spotted. Even a field of yellow chamomile on a humid summer morning, rendered in oil pastel by my mother’s own mother, was derided.

This was my family’s way of speaking truth about saccharine simplifications. Life wasn’t simple, art wasn’t simple. Art was supposed to say profound things. In a song, on a page or framed, it showed or otherwise expressed experience viscerally. Fine art was never simple – it could never smack of anything “twee.” There was always a thorn on the rose, a snake in the grass somewhere. Maybe you needed to know how to look at it, but depth was always there. As students in art school, we debated what qualifies as art, and now I hear my own students carry on the same debate.

I’ve been learning to play piano lately, and while working through a book of lessons and music for adult beginners, I bumped up against Over the Rainbow by Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg, made famous by Judy Garland in the 1939 MGM movie The Wizard of Oz.

The song begins with “Some – where …” Do you need to read any more than the first word to hear the swelling music in your head? To imagine the singer with a far-off look in her eye, feel a sympathetic lightness in your heart?

I slumped on my piano bench and sneered to myself, “What’s this sentimental syrup doing here?”

I flipped the page. Maybe there was a different song – something less candy-coated further on in the book I could try. Maybe I was done practising for the day. “Come on. Get back here. Give it a try,” I said to myself. “You may not love it, but you want to be able to play the piano for yourself, to entertain others – any song, any exercise will help you achieve that goal.”

“Geez, oh man. Okay, okay. I’ll try,” I sighed.

There is a fair amount to master in the song; by no means is it easy. I don’t have big hands, but still, my fingers are all crowded around middle C. I know the tune, but still I try to count the beats to get the timing right.

As I played, I discovered the harmonies are quite lovely – even if they occasionally suggested (to me) the (ever-tacky) timbre of a flugelhorn. But it was the words that caught me:

Story continues below advertisement

“Somewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue / And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.”

The dreams you dare to dream. Hmm. Not just any old, everyday dreams, the ones you hold close and dear, and don’t tell anybody about. Those ones, those precious gems – over the rainbow, those ones do come true. Wow. That’s mighty hopeful.

“Somewhere, over the rainbow / Bluebirds fly …”

Okay. Makes sense. How do I get there, I wondered, but I kept on playing.

“Birds fly over the rainbow / Why then, oh why, can’t I?”

Ouch. Reality bangs against the window.

Story continues below advertisement

I’ve never taken the time to hear the lyrics, to learn the words, to really pay attention. There are some childish words and thoughts about troubles melting like lemon drops, but sitting there at the piano, playing the music, trying to sing the words – it got real. Why can’t I find that wonderful place? Tell me.

“If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow, why, oh why, can’t I?”

To me, the song is heartbreaking. It is beautiful. My eyes suddenly hurt, but I laugh instead. Gaping sadness. There is something I want so much, isn’t there? Something I could have, just over there, in a place that the puny, innocent bluebirds can reach, but I can’t. I won’t ever be able to.

The song is like a sucker punch wrapped in a perfect, fluffy white layer cake with sugary icing smoothed all over. It draws you in, then knocks you down. And what’s left? What comes after? You have to drag yourself off the floor, clean yourself up and realize the truth about life, about dreams, and about what is really possible.

But what are my dreams: discovering true, uncomplicated, rich love that doesn’t skimp on passion? A house on a hill whose panoramic view could humble any landscape painting? A flashy car parked in the driveway? A sailboat at the marina where, on a whim, my love and I could pack a picnic and sail away for an afternoon or escape for all of August?

Some of us live in worlds where anything is possible. For others, it might be possible with a little extra money, with a connection or with an education. But for me, it’s not all possible, and many dreams won’t ever come true. I don’t believe in a world of dreams, of symbols, of clicking one’s heels together and speaking magic phrases to make things happen. In many ways, I wish the world worked that way, but I can’t believe in that. For me, it’s not real. I’ve stopped wishing.

Story continues below advertisement

But what’s worse? To stop believing in dreams coming true, or loss of dreams altogether? I don’t know what I’d wish for. Maybe I have everything I want, or maybe I’ve just lost hope and the desire for more. I want more, but more what? What could really make me truly happy? And if I knew, could I really get it?

I take a deep breath, and start playing the song again, taking the time to finesse playing the cascading notes that build the harmonies, enjoying the resolving chords. Maybe when I’ve got the hang of playing it, I’ll play the song for Chris. She’ll like that.

I’m not sure I know what sentimental is or isn’t. Even though I teach art, I don’t know what art is. But this song isn’t simple or for the simple-minded. There is depth there, and understanding about life and reality.

And it is set to some beautiful music, even if it could use some flugelhorns.

Maybe my dreams are smaller. Maybe they are within grasp – somewhere.

Should I be worried about my uncle?

My uncle suffers from manic depression and he is fed up with life. He wants a medically assisted death, but he doesn’t have a terminal disease. I think he is going to be extremely upset if he is turned down. Should I be worried about how he might react?

The answer:

Yes, you should be concerned about your uncle.

Canadian law doesn’t preclude people with serious mental illnesses – including manic depression or bipolar disorder – from seeking medical assistance in dying, known as MAID for short.

But to qualify, they have to meet certain criteria. In particular, they must have an incurable illness and natural death must be reasonably foreseeable. What’s more, they must have the mental capacity to make an informed decision.

So, if your uncle is not on a clear trajectory toward death, he is unlikely to have his request granted.

Among some health care professionals, there is a growing awareness that patients can be psychologically vulnerable in the period immediately after their application has been denied.

In a recently published study, a Toronto team of MAID assessors and providers report that three patients attempted suicide soon after they were deemed ineligible for an assisted death. In two of the cases, the patients didn’t have a foreseeable death. The third patient lacked mental capacity.

“We were, frankly, a bit caught off guard when it happened the first time,” says Sally Bean, one of the co-authors of the study and an ethicist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto. “It wasn’t something we had anticipated.”

The three individuals had several things in common, says Elie Isenberg-Grzeda, lead author of the study and a staff psychiatrist at Sunnybrook.

They all had a history of depression and also suffered from mild cognitive impairment. Two of them had previously attempted suicide.

“The core features of depression are hopelessness about the future, suicidal thoughts and sometimes inflexibility in thinking,” explains Isenberg-Grzeda. “Similarly, cognitive impairment can prevent people from processing information clearly.” Both these conditions may increase the likelihood of self-harm.

Story continues below advertisement

To prevent further suicide attempts, the clinicians revised their MAID process to identify in advance individuals who might be at risk.

“We started doing pre-assessments, looking at patients’ [medical] charts, and then managing the patients’ expectations,” Isenberg-Grzeda says.

They also put together support plans for people whose MAID requests are turned down.

The efforts appear to have paid off. There hasn’t been another suicide attempt since the process was changed more than a year ago.

The study, published in the Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, “sheds light on an important issue,” says Stefanie Green, president of the Canadian Association of MAID Assessors and Providers in Victoria.

She says she is aware of other patients who did die by suicide after being denied MAID.

Story continues below advertisement

“Probably the hardest thing we have to do is tell some people they are ineligible for assisted death,” adds Green.

“These are people who obviously believe they are suffering intolerably, and who are asking for our help, yet we are unable to aid them.”

Bean says many of the patients who seek MAID are highly independent individuals with long-held beliefs in the right to die. “They feel they should be able to control the circumstances of their death.”

What’s more, some of them are under the false assumption that they become eligible for MAID by simply signing a request form, which is available online.

The reality is very different. Those patients must go through a formal assessment to determine whether they meet the qualifications set out in legislation passed by the federal government in 2016.

“It would be a pretty devastating blow to be found ineligible,” Bean says. “They had hoped MAID would end their suffering and then told it’s not an option.”

Based on the MAID assessment study done at Sunnybrook, Isenberg-Grzeda believes numerous patients who don’t qualify for an assisted death could be at risk of self-harm.

He notes that the three attempted-suicide cases make up just 2.8 per cent of the 107 patients assessed for MAID eligibility during the study period from June, 2016, to April, 2019.

However, he adds, they represent 30 per cent of the 10 deemed ineligible for MAID. “This is a substantial proportion [of the rejected cases] and I think that is what makes this so significant.”

He believes it’s critically important for MAID assessors and providers to ensure that patients have realistic expectations.

And, in the case of your uncle, he would likely benefit from having someone – possibly his health care provider or a trusted adviser – clearly explain the process so that he is not surprised and disappointed if he applies for MAID and is found ineligible.

Is the ventilation in schools good enough?","Catch up: Q&A with André Picard and Nicole MacIntyre

COVID-19 and school: In less than a month, millions of children will return to school as Canada enters the next stage of its pandemic response. With some provinces offering online learning, many families are agonizing over whether they should send their children back amid growing concern about class sizes, mask rules and safety protocols.

Reopening schools

Nicole MacIntyre: Do you think Canada is ready to open schools?

André Picard: We have to get kids back to school, and we have to figure out how to do it as safely as possible.

Story continues below advertisement

Nothing is 100 per cent safe. But I would also say, if you look at our data, our cases are coming down in most of the country and we are doing relatively well. There’s probably not a better time to go back to school.

If there's a second wave coming, then we will have to adjust.

We have to figure out how to get kids into school as safely as possible and then have a Plan B – what happens if cases take off again? At what point do we shut it down again? We have to be ready for both.

Kids need school for a whole bunch of reasons. Parents need kids in school for economic reasons.

Kids need to interact – it’s good for their mental health, for their development. There are all kinds of good reasons, but it’s all about getting the balance right.

Nicole: What is that balance?

Andre: There are a few basic things.

Story continues below advertisement

I think that the number of children is really, really important to have enough space for physical distancing. Physical distancing is our number one tool. If you're not near anyone, you are not going to be infected.

Then, we have to have the basic hygiene measures: Wash your hand, wear a mask, use your hand sanitizer.

Third is a little more complicated. We need to figure out how to have cohorts or pods to limit the number of interactions. Every interaction is a risk. The smaller the [cohort or pod], the fewer interactions you have. The other really important thing about pods and class sizes, is when there is a case, we don’t have to panic. It’s going to be easier to track and trace, and limit the spread.

It’s not about having no cases; that’s impossible. It’s about limiting the number of cases and limiting the harm. That’s what we want to do while having the benefits of education.

Watch the highlights of the Q&A

Globe health columnist André Picard and deputy national editor Nicole MacIntyre discuss the many issues surrounding sending kids back to school. André says moving forward isn't about there being no COVID-19 cases, but limiting their number and severity through distancing, smaller classes, masks and good hygiene. The Globe and Mail

Are masks safe for kids?

Nicole: My eight-year-old will wear his mask for about 45 minutes before he starts complaining that it makes him feel bad, and his head hurts and it’s hard to breathe. Some readers have asked, are there going to be health consequences of children wearing masks?

André: The short answer to that is no, you’re not going to be unable to breathe. You’re not going to get carbon monoxide poisoning. People do 12-hour surgeries wearing masks and they don’t drop dead.

Story continues below advertisement

It’s going to be uncomfortable for kids, it’s going to be a bother. They’re going to yank at them. That is fine. You don’t want perfect to be the enemy of good.

Our colleague Wency Leung wrote a great piece about masks for kids with some good tips: Make the kids pick them themselves, have something they like, make sure it’s comfortable and that the elastic doesn’t yank at their ears. Make it as easy as possible for the kids to wear them so they become second nature.

What criteria should be used for reopening schools?

Nicole: In the U.S., there’s been some kind of criteria – a bar that’s been set – for when it is safe to open schools. We haven’t seen those same rules come out in Canada; can you just talk a little bit about both: What guidelines have come out and how they would apply in Canada?

André: There’s really good guidance out of the U.S., [whereas] the provincial back to school plans are so obtuse and useless. There’s no practical information. What the Americans do really well is synthesize information and tell you “here’s how to choose.” That’s what we need.

The guidance I really like is the Harvard School of Public Health’s red light, green light system. If there are more than 25 cases per 100,000 population, then that’s a red light and you absolutely don’t go back to school. Yellow light means there are 1 to 9 cases per 100,000, and maybe go back, but be cautious. Green light means you should be fine going to school.

Where’s Canada? Most of Canada is yellow, so we’re not doing too bad. But yellow light is supposed to say “Be cautious, be ready to stop.” That’s the attitude we have to have. Now is a pretty good time to go back. But let’s be careful. Let’s be really vigilant. If the numbers shoot up, we have to be ready to shut it down again.

Story continues below advertisement

Worldwide, how have school reopenings gone?

Nicole: Some countries have reopened schools, and it’s gone very well; in some places it’s gone very poorly. Can you talk to us a little bit about some of the global examples of return to school?

André: Overall, it’s gone pretty well in schools. There have been some disasters, but most countries are doing this well overall.

Two extreme examples come to mind.

One of the first countries to go back was Denmark. They did everything right. They have small classes, testing of children, low community spread. There have been very few cases in their schools and their daycares.

The thing to remember about Denmark is they don’t have classes of 30 to begin with. They have classes of 15. It’s better for education, it’s better for health. The other thing is they ride their bikes to school; they don’t take buses.

The other example that’s really been singled out is the huge cluster in a middle school in Israel. What I think we can learn from that is that when you’re arrogant, you’re gonna pay the price.

Story continues below advertisement

They didn’t enforce mask rules, they were very loosey goosey about the distancing. We don’t know what was going on in the community, but I don’t think they were taking it too seriously in the community. They did everything wrong.

I think there are important lessons at both ends of the spectrum. Hopefully we will lean more toward learning from Denmark.

Then we have countries where it’s a little more complicated like South Korea. They never closed their schools, and recently they have had to because they had big outbreaks again that started getting to school. The reminder from South Korea is you have to keep up with these measures. The virus is always looking for an opportunity to sneak in.

Is the ventilation in schools good enough?

Nicole: What do we know about ventilation and the role it’s playing in spreading the virus? What should we expect from our schools, knowing that we’re going back in about three weeks?

André: I think parents have to be careful to not get too hung up on this. The virus circulates in the air, but the big risk is somebody coughing in your face. So again, we have to keep that context.

A lot of these HVAC systems are out of date and probably need to be updated. That's 50 years of neglect. The reality is we are not going to fix it overnight.

Story continues below advertisement

As much as possible, let’s have open windows. There’s lots of talk about bringing air purifiers in there – they are probably helpful a little bit.

But again, I always come back to: If there’s fewer kids in the class, this stuff matters less. It’s all about the numbers more than anything else.

The offices of commercial real estate service firm Avison Young in downtown Vancouver reopened in the first week of June after a total lockdown. But three months later, fewer than half of the 125 employees typically come in to the office on any given day, while the rest still work remotely.

“This is better than most offices; when I talk with tenants, many of them are still at 10 to 25 per cent occupancy,” says Aaron Burry, principal of Avison Young in Vancouver.

So far, such low turnouts have made it relatively simple to physically distance without reshuffling office furniture and there are only brief waits for elevators with capacity limits. But as people who have spent the summer working remotely decide to make the traditional fall return to office life, it poses significant challenges, property managers say.

“There’s no question there’s a burnout. More and more people who at first loved working from home are becoming anxious to return and interact with colleagues,” says Stan Krawitz, vice-chairman, founder and head of commercial real estate services company Savills Canada. On top of that, “companies are starting to notice that while productivity for heads-down work hasn’t changed materially, productivity in creative, problem-solving and synergistic work is way, way off.”

Repopulating offices in the COVID-19 era could result in bottlenecks if everyone returns in the fall, he suggests. Even with fewer than a quarter of employees working in high rise towers in Canadian cities now, the wait times for elevators that are restricted to three or four riders a car can be as long as 20 minutes.

“If we see higher concentrations in the towers, the wait could be an hour. That could have a demotivating effect on people coming back … and that’s not a productive use of employees’ time,” Mr. Krawitz cautions.

For low-rise offices, the option is taking the stairs, says Sharon Turner, director of interiors for Canada at HOK, a design and architecture firm. “Most buildings have two sets of staircases for fire safety and we advise they make one flight directional up and the other set down. The last thing you want is people passing each other on the stairs huffing and puffing.” But even for those in very good shape, stair climbing to upper floors of high rises is impractical.

According to Ms. Turner, most office interiors are being adapted rather than completely redesigned because things are changing so quickly.

“Clients are often just blocking off desks to increase distance around work stations,” she says. “Some are putting in tall dividers, but not necessarily ceiling-high panels.”

“Often a planter will suffice to provide spacing,” she suggests.

Some companies are using apps on phones to notify employees how many are currently in the office and to allow them to reserve a work station on their way to work. Other apps that count movements can indicate when lavatories are unoccupied and, if busy, whether there are alternatives on another floor.

Break rooms are also a significant issue, Ms. Turner says. Touchless coffee makers are on the market, although they are pricey. Refrigerators, microwaves and photocopiers need to have sanitizing wipes alongside for cleaning them after each use.

Les Miller, managing partner and chief executive of Crown Realty Partners in Toronto, believes that this emergency is speeding up environmental improvements that will make offices more attractive and productive in the future.

Ventilation and air filtration to prevent virus circulation is another concern for many returning to work. In Crown Realty’s offices at 400 University Avenue, says Mr. Miller, air filtration equipment is being cleaned more often and the filters have been upgraded to higher-spec devices that can remove up to 99.9 per cent of particles in the air.

“Like anything else these systems cost more but they can also take care of pollen and odours that less expensive ones will not,” he says.

The focus on sanitation and physical distancing could force a rethink of the growing trend toward communal open offices, he adds. “The novelty of working at picnic tables and having no assigned seating is gone. I think there will be a reversion to assigned seating and maybe even a redevelopment of closed-in offices and acrylic dividers between desks. I firmly believe that people will want to know a work area is theirs and no one else has touched it.”

Half-occupancy may also continue for an extended duration even as office life resumes. That’s the case in the Edmonton office of Avison Young, where the current plan is to not exceed more than 50 per cent of the staff on site at one time, explains Scott Varga, senior project manager for Alberta.

“The staff is divided into Team A, who come in Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and Team B, who come in Tuesday and Thursday,” he explains. To date, the company has spent $50,000 on directional and procedural stickers and signage in the Calgary and Edmonton offices, he adds.

Mr. Varga is convinced that a new sense of normalcy will develop over time. “At some point, people are going to feel comfortable working in the office again. Meanwhile, the economy needed a good kick in the butt to become more modern and efficient and that’s going to benefit the economy in the long run.”

Mr. Krawitz agrees; and because the situation is still fluid, he cautions landlords not to commit to major office rebuilding renovations. “Making massive changes to designs is foolish. The pendulum will swing back; maybe not to where it was before COVID, but things are not going to be stuck the way they are today, so spending money to make drastic changes is likely money poorly spent.”

Like any major shift, “the key is communication from leaders of organizations to have a clear plan and to continuously communicate the plan to the team and not overreact,” he says.

Investors saw wild swings in their portfolios in recent months amid the economic fallout from COVID-19 and now are bracing for a potential second wave of the pandemic.

The virus’s possible resurgence comes alongside other expected events in the coming months including the U.S. presidential election and a potential COVID-19 vaccine.

Investors should prepare for more uncertainty in the short term, says John Hood, president and portfolio manager at J.C. Hood Investment Counsel Inc. in Pickering, Ont.

Story continues below advertisement

“You have to have a strategy for dealing with it,” he says. “Panic is not a strategy.”

Mr. Hood recommends investors look carefully at their portfolio, ensure it’s diversified – and not in areas likely to get hit hard by a second coronavirus wave such as real estate, hospitality, oil and gas, and airlines.

He sold off his bond holdings and has “more cash on hand now than I have had in the last 20 years,” waiting to put it to work.

Gold expected to keep shining

Some of the best-performing ETFs amid the pandemic have been in haven investments such as gold or U.S. Treasuries, which are “safety assets and repositories of panic buying,” says Daniel Straus, head of ETF research and strategy at National Bank Financial Inc.

Although gold’s performance has been “quite eye-popping,” there may be more room for bullion to rise, especially if the second wave gets worse, Mr. Straus says.

“We still are big fans of those assets as ballasts in a portfolio in small amounts, so you can have an asset that zigs when everything else zags,” Mr. Straus says, but adds there “may be a limited amount of headroom” for gains.

Mr. Strauss likes the Purpose Gold Bullion Fund (KILO-T), which is backed by physical gold and has a low management expense ratio (MER) of 0.26 per cent. KILO’s assets under management (AUM) are about $236.9-million, and the ETF is up 28.8 per cent so far this year. (All data from Morningstar as of Aug. 17.)

Gold ETFs have had a strong run, adds Mr. Hood, but mainly because of the U.S. dollar’s decline. “I think it’s a lousy asset,” he says, adding that “gold at $5,000 [as some gold bugs are forecasting] – that’s not happening.”

However, since investors turn to gold when markets decline, it can be beneficial to hold a little as the pandemic persists, Mr. Hood says.

He recommends larger gold ETFs such as the iShares S&P/TSX Global Gold Index ETF (XGD-T), which holds big global miners. XGD has $1.6-billion in AUM, an MER of 0.61 per cent and a year-to-date return of 50.3 per cent.

The less risky option, Mr. Hood says, is the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD-A), which is backed by physical bullion. It has an AUM of US$79.4-billion, an MER of 0.40 per cent and a year-to-date return of 30.5 per cent. “It’s a tactical hedge,” Mr. Hood says.

For U.S. Treasuries, Mr. Straus suggests the BMO Long-Term U.S. Treasury Bond Index ETF (ZTL-NE), which invests in U.S. Treasuries with a maturity of more than 20 years. ZTL is up 23.2 per cent year-to-date, has $74.3-million AUM and a 0.22 per cent MER. However, Mr. Straus notes these investments can be volatile, and ZTL has started to come down in price since the level it reached in February and March. Its three-month loss is 7.6 per cent.

Groceries, tech and health care expected to outperform

A few select sectors are expected to benefit once again if a second wave of the pandemic hits, ranging from consumer staples to technology to health care.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Straus points to two recently launched health-care ETFs “that really seem to be in the right place at the right time.”

One is the ETFMG Treatments Testing and Advancements ETF (GERM-A), which invests in biotech companies working on testing and treatments of infectious diseases. It has an AUM of US$74.5-million and an MER of 0.68 per cent. The ETF was launched on June 17 and is down 7.8 per cent over the past month.

The second is the Pacer Biothreat Strategy ETF (VIRS-A), launched on June 24. It invests in U.S. companies that aim to protect against, endure or recover from biological threats to human health. It has an AUM of US$5.5-million, an MER of 0.70 per cent and is up 3.2 per cent over the past month.

“Even in the first few weeks since they’ve launched, they’ve had amazing performance because they focus on the segments of the health-care industry that may well be best positioned to deal with our viral realities,” Mr. Straus says.

Technology, which has benefited as people rely on digital services to do everything from online shopping to working from home, “has more room to grow,” says Charlie Spiring, co-founder, chairman and senior investment advisor at Wellington-Altus Private Wealth Inc. in Winnipeg.

Mr. Spiring likes Emerge Canada Inc.‘s new ARK ETFs, which are just over a year old. “They cover the gamut of what’s changing and growing in the world,” he says. “They’re up ridiculous amounts.”

Story continues below advertisement

The Emerge ARK Global Disruptive Innovation ETF (EARK-NE) is an actively managed fund focusing on “technology-enabled new products or services that could potentially change the way the world works,” he says. A few of its top holdings include Tesla Inc., Invitae Corp., and Square Inc. EARK is up 66.3 per cent so far this year.

Emerge ARK series also include the Genomics and Biotech ETF (EAGB-NE); the AI & Big Data ETF (EAAI-NE); the Autonomous Tech & Robotics ETF (EAUT-NE); and the Fintech Innovation ETF (EAFT-NE). All are up between about 55 per cent and 82 per cent so far this year

Mr. Spiring also likes the Evolve Cyber Security Index ETF (CYBR-T), given the rapid rise in demand for cybersecurity.

“This is evolving so fast out there. I think there’s no end of [money] that firms, when in jeopardy, will spend to keep hackers away and deal with it,” Mr. Spiring says. CYBR has about $96-million in AUM, an MER of 0.63 per cent and a year-to-date return of 32 per cent.

There are other niche technology investments to take advantage of a potential second wave, Mr. Strauss adds. The Global X E-commerce ETF (EBIZ-Q), which, as the name suggests, invests in e-commerce companies, has US$74.6-million in AUM, an MER of 0.50 per cent, and is up 53.5 per cent so far this year.

But Mr. Straus recommends pairing it with a more conservative ETF pick, such as consumer staples. One option is the iShares S&P/TSX Capped Consumer Staples Index ETF (XST-T), with an AUM of $120.5-million, an MER of 0.61 per cent and a year-to-date return of 7.3 per cent.

“It’s a little bit of a protective position,” Mr. Straus says, noting XST didn’t fall as much as the overall market earlier this year and still participated in the strong recovery to date."

He then tosses himself backward onto a glass coffee table, throws his body into a bookshelf and pummels his face until he bleeds. I remember this scene, 21 years later, because it was so darn abnormal.

Unfortunately, when it comes to investing, this kind of behaviour is far too common. Most of us don’t smash our heads into laptops after logging into our accounts. But when faced with a market crash, too many people make self-inflicted cuts, according to research from Fidelity Investments. The firm reports that almost one-third of its investors over age 65 liquidated all of their stock-market assets between Feb. 20 and May 15 this year. In other words, when the markets crashed, they sealed in their losses.

In contrast, those who had Zen-like calm and a portfolio of ETFs are expected to see a profit for the year so far, despite the market’s madness. And it wouldn’t have required a sophisticated ETF, a special allocation or even deft trading. In fact, almost any diversified allocation of stocks and bonds should be in the black year-to-date.

Story continues below advertisement

Vanguard, iShares and BMO each offer all-in-one portfolio ETFs that charge annual fees between 0.17 per cent and 0.25 per cent per year. Despite the COVID-19 market swings, they are all up for 2020.

For example, BMO’s Conservative ETF (ZCON) comprises about 60-per-cent bonds and 40-per-cent stocks. In other words, it’s nothing special. No fancy fund manager moves the money around, trying to dodge and weave when the markets rise and fall. Yet from Jan. 1 to Aug. 21 this year, this conservative, diversified fund gained 5.8 per cent. (All ETF performance data is total price return from Morningstar). If you had a similarly allocated portfolio of individual ETFs, you might have done even better – if you didn’t speculate. After all, you could have paid even lower fees with the same allocation.

Skeptics might argue that this fund’s conservative allocation helped it make money during the market’s roller coaster. But riskier blends made money too. BMO’s Balanced ETF (ZBAL), for example, includes about 60-per-cent stocks and 40-per-cent bonds. Its year-to-date return is 4.3 per cent. Once again, investors in individual ETFs (paying even lower fees) would have done even better with the same allocation – if they kept their heads.

Despite this year’s market volatility, investors in even higher-risk portfolios should have made money, too. BMO’s Growth ETF (ZGRO) is made up of about 20-per-cent bonds and 80-per-cent stocks. But despite its higher risk allocation, it also earned a profit. Its year-to-date return is 3.5 per cent.

Plenty of people fared far worse this year. If your portfolio didn’t match or beat these ETFs, you either paid high investment fees, took unnecessary risks or fiddled with your money. It’s tempting to speculate when the media calls for financial armageddon. But even pros that gamble crash onto coffee tables.

Hedge-fund returns provide painful evidence. The HFRX hedge-fund index measures surviving hedge-fund results. Such managers are supposed to see the future. If they think stocks will fall, they can short the market – collecting profits for investors if they guess right. They can pour everything into gold or bonds if they think they will soar. They can move everything into equities if they think stocks will fly. If anyone could stickhandle around the COVID-19 mess, you might give credit to a hedge-fund manager.

But that faith would be misplaced. Measured in U.S. dollars, the average surviving U.S. hedge fund gained about 1.16 per cent year-to-date as of Aug. 20. Over that same period, Vanguard’s simple balanced index fund (60-per-cent U.S. stocks and 40-per-cent U.S. bonds) gained about 7.3 per cent. No matter how you slice them, globally diversified portfolios of stock and bond ETFs beat these masters of the universe.

Effective investing is simple: own a diversified portfolio of ETFs or an all-in-one portfolio ETF. Ignore everyone who claims they can see the future. Ignore your inner voice that says, “Do something now.”

Like Fidelity’s investors who sold when stocks crashed, fear and greed cause self-inflicted pain. Always remember that nobody can see the future. I can’t promise a tonic to control your inner fears, but that Fight Club clip on YouTube might offer some laughs and a remedy."

The two-year-old company also graduated last week from the new pandemic recovery stream of the University of Toronto’s renowned Creative Destruction Lab entrepreneurship program, called CDL Recovery.

Provision’s new pandemic-specific software, called Basecase, requires food production workers to fill out digital forms monitoring for COVID-19 symptoms and any potential exposure before arriving at work each day. Only once these forms are filled out do employees receive a unique access code, by e-mail or text message, that lets them enter the facility that day.

Companies across the country are trying to figure out the safest way to return to normal operations as the pandemic stretches into its sixth month – and, in the case of in-person operations like food producers, ensure their staff stays healthy. Many, in turn, are trying to figure out the safest and most secure method to monitor for symptoms in a systemic way.

“If you have a widespread shutdown in a food-processing plant because of an outbreak, not only is it a massive financial hit to your organization, you might actually have empty shelves in grocery stores,” said Mark Cunningham, a serial entrepreneur and CDL adviser who worked closely with Provision. “… What Provision is really helping with is easing peoples’ fear, uncertainty and doubt.”

Provision says its software allows staff to track data by the hour, allowing for early detection of COVID-19 symptoms to minimize transmission of the disease – with the aim of making staff feel more comfortable at work while minimizing the risk of hurting food supply. Its customers include Centennial Foodservice, a division of Premium Brands Holdings Corp. that distributes meat and seafood products across the country.

“The goal here is to respond to symptoms early instead of responding to outbreaks late,” said Kevin Davies, Provision’s chief marketing officer, who designed Basecase.

Provision’s founders, who include chief executive Erik Westblom, product vice-president Michael Gibbons and chief technology officer Chris Elias, launched the company as they sought ways to make food supply chains more efficient – including how food is farmed, produced, stored and transported. They explored ideas as part of a food waste reduction startup program run by multinational logistics and shipping company Maersk in Copenhagen in 2018.

The company soon launched eponymous software that tracks information along food supply chains, from farming and production to storage and transportation, to monitor quality and ensure safety compliance. Many of the organizations along these chains still use paper and spreadsheets to track information, with little information sharing.

Traditional paperwork can make it difficult to trace problems back to their root causes, such as when food products are recalled because of the presence of dangerous bacteria. “This gives us an immense opportunity to digitize and change that industry – and something like COVID gives a real spotlight,” Mr. Westblom said. Clients of the standard Provision software include VersaCold, one of Canada’s most prominent supply chain companies focused on storing and transporting temperature-sensitive foods.

The dangers of COVID-19 to food producers became highly visible in Alberta in the early months of the pandemic, when one of the biggest outbreaks in North America struck a Cargill Ltd. meat-processing plant near High River.

Although some companies began tracking employees for symptoms during the pandemic, staff at Provision realized they could retool the employee management portion of its software to streamline the process and catch infections quickly. After conversations with some hardware manufacturers, Mr. Davies said, Provision realized that requiring access codes would help mitigate symptomatic people from entering production facilities.

Through the CDL Recovery program, announced in April, Provision’s staff worked to tailor the product to this new potential market.

Provision announced in April that it had raised $3.2-million in seed financing, led by the California venture capital firm Builders VC with contributions from investors affiliated with CDL as well as Edmonton’s TrustBIX Inc., which does similar work with food supply chains.

TrustBIX brought with it a network of contacts in the food production industry, and helped connect Provision with Centennial Foodservice, and is helping Centennial roll out 775 Basecase licences to track employees as well as inspectors, clients and other guests across 14 facilities. (A Centennial representative was not available for comment.)

Trevor Gartner, TrustBIX’s chief operating officer, said his staff had been conducting significant research into how its clients could best comply with health regulations and reduce the coronavirus’s spread in food production. Some were as simple to implement as physical distancing and shift staggering. But Mr. Gartner said Provision has come up with a solution to the problem the market struggled with most: screening employees and monitoring for trends.

“Unless you record or aggregate data, you can’t see trends,” Mr. Gartner said. “That was the remaining piece that nobody had resolved yet.”

The backstory

Open this photo in gallery The home's grand reception can accommodate 200 people. Francis L’Hotelin/Francis L'Hotelin

In 1987, Lynne Kolber Halliday’s mother insisted she get married in June.

Her parents, Leo and Sandra, were preparing to tear down their California-style house at the peak of a mountain in Montreal’s Westmount neighbourhood and replace it with a 32-room bungalow. But first, they had to host a wedding.

About 130 chairs were lined up in the yard with an aisle marking the middle. After the official ceremony at noon, tables were setup around the pool, which was covered and transformed into a dance floor.

“It was very glittery,” Lynne says. “It was our Barbie and Ken wedding.” The following day, the couple had a second wedding in New York with their friends.

Open this photo in gallery The pool at Leo and Sandra's home was converted into a dance floor for their daughter's wedding Francis L’Hotelin/Francis L'Hotelin

Many of the attendees were well-known Canadians, including former prime minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau and Charles Dutoit, former music director of the Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal. Lynne’s father, Leo, was appointed to the Senate by Trudeau in 1983 and served for 20 years, which included chairing the Senate Banking Committee. Trudeau and Leo were not just colleagues. They were close friends. On one occasion, they travelled across the Trans-Siberian Railway together and on another, they ventured to Vietnam.

Aside from his appointment as senator, Leo had an impressive portfolio. He was a trusted advisor to the Bronfman family, having met Charles Bronfman at McGill University, where they become lifelong friends. He also ran Cadillac Fairview Corporation and became an Officer of the Order of Canada, recognized for his fundraising efforts.

In January, just 10 days shy of his 91st birthday, Leo passed away. His wife Sandra died in 2001. The couple left their house in Montreal to their children Lynne and Jonathan.

The house today

The Kolbers were entertainers, and their house matched their hospitality. When guests stepped inside of their 940-square-foot entryway, they were greeted by a 20-foot ceiling with an oculus skylight that flooded the foyer with sunshine. The grand reception could accommodate 200 people. They never rented plates, according to Lynne, indicating that dinner parties and fundraisers were not rare occasions. Leo was the Liberal Party’s chief fundraiser and often held events for Montreal’s universities, hospitals and Jewish causes.

There were family celebrations at the house, too. For Jonathan’s bar mitzvah, they turned their four-car garage, elevated with geothermal heating and an elastomeric membrane roof, into a disco. Actor Harry Belafonte attended and danced with Leo, both men gripping roses in their mouths, pretending to be toreadors.

Before Leo and Sandra got married, they took dance lessons and frequently broke into the pasodoble, a fast-paced Spanish double step dance, at events. Their guests also seemed enthusiastic about performing. Frequent attendee Brian Mulroney was known for busting into song, belting out the lyrics to Irish Eyes were Smiling, Lynne recalls.

The Kolber’s Westmount home, across from Summit Woods, was equipped with a host’s every need: a chef’s kitchen with a breakfast room, updated four years ago; a butler’s pantry connecting the kitchen to the formal dining room for seamless catering; a 1,000-bottle wine cellar; and a media room.

The best feature

When Leo and Trudeau would share an intimate conversation, they sat in the “Big Red Room,” as Lynne calls it. A dish of caviar often sat between them as a flame crackled in the fireplace and snow matted the windows.

When the Kolbers weren’t entertaining, the Big Red Room was where they lived. The walls were painted with a rich red, adding ambient warmth to the room. Bookcases framed the walls. A mix of taupe leather couches and intricately woven brocade sofas were perched throughout.

The Big Red Room was also known as the library. Lynne’s mother was always reading fiction, and her dad was always reading non-fiction, anything on the topic of Israeli and American politics, or the mafia. Beautiful, heavy books containing Canadian photography sat out on coffee tables.

Inside the library is the house’s best feature, according to Christina Miller, the Kolber’s real estate broker. Beside a wall of books is a bar counter, which opens up to a sleek black room stacked with wine and whisky glasses. But the true hidden component is a secret: inside of the bar there is a pocket wall that opens onto the grand reception room.

Who’s buying?

Open this photo in gallery The property offers privacy, with only one other house on the block. Francis L’Hotelin/Francis L'Hotelin

So far, a wide range of potential buyers has viewed the house, says Ms. Miller. She could see people who are living in condominiums but seeking more privacy during the pandemic being interested in the home. There are only two houses on the block, providing coveted space.

On the other hand, she’s toured families who have young kids and couples who haven’t even started families yet. The house is just 10 minutes from downtown Montreal, an ideal location for parents working in the city. In her view, the buyers could be anywhere from 35 to 75 years old.

In March, Cindy Windover’s fridge leaked, leading to a kitchen renovation that would last five months instead of an anticipated six weeks.

Largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Canada has faced a significant downturn in home renovation spending, leading to a lack of accessible building supplies and contractors. The Windovers’ Lakefield, Ont. renovation faced challenges as a result.

When it came to picking everything from paint to flooring, Cindy said, “Everything basically had to be done online. It was not easy.”

These difficulties are echoed across the country. Altus Group, a Toronto-based commercial real estate company, reported in July that home renovation spending across the country is on the decline this year. In the Altus study, total renovation spending includes both capital and current expenditures – alterations, improvements, conversions and repairs.

According to Altus, while residential renovation spending in Canada reached almost $80-billion last year – growing at a stronger pace than the overall economy – the pandemic has eroded consumer confidence and renovation intentions.

Dave Wilkes, president and CEO of the Building, Industry and Land Development Association (BILD), calls home renovation spending in Canada a “huge driver of our economy,” providing more than 700,000 jobs in Canada and $42.5-billion in wages. The investment value in those renovations is about $82-billion, making it a bigger segment of the Canadian economy than new home building.

In an interview, Peter Norman, chief economist at Altus Group, said the report underscored renovation as a vital sector, despite seeming like a small, occasional expense to Canadians.

Construction and renovation sites were deemed essential by the Ontario government in May, but the industry has taken a hit across Canada regardless, impacting the building supply industry. Specifically, the economic shock is projected to hit hardest in Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, and Saskatchewan.

Liz Kovach, president of the Western Retail Lumber Association, has already seen region-specific effects on her industry. She points to the “trickle effect” of the area’s economy: “When you look at the industry, it provides so many jobs to Canadians, and even just to those in Western Canada, that it gives them the ability to then spend on other things.”

Conversely, the Altus study predicts that British Columbia will face the most muted decline in renovation spending – a trend matched in the experience of Thomas Foreman, president of the Building Supply Industry Association of B.C.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Foreman says the B.C. building supplies industry is “smoking hot” right now – but the issue is product shortages. Plants and mills cannot keep up with province-wide demand, which he says is partially due to a “booming” popularity of do-it-yourself renovations .

Gregg Evans, manager of Leathertown Lumber in Acton, Ont., called recent cross-country lumber shortages “a nightmare.” Summer is usually the store’s busiest time, but now, he says, staff are unable to supply three-quarters of the orders they normally could.

“It’s incredibly frustrating,” Mr. Evans said. “It’s getting worse by the day.”

Greg Drouillard of Target Building Materials in Windsor, Ont., is in a similar plight. His store sells 3,500-plus products, and supplies such as Plexiglass are hard to find. “Nobody was prepared for COVID. When it hit, manufacturers slowed down production – and bingo.”

At Altus, Mr. Norman said while the study found a fall-off in major renovations, renovation plans still taking place have moved into do-it-yourself “fixing up around the house.” About two-thirds of overall renovation spending is on contractor work, whereas the rest is the DIY sector.

Both Mr. Drouillard and Mr. Evans point to DIY business as a new phenomenon exacerbating the demand in products: “weekend warrior” customers have found an interest in home renovation work because it has been difficult to find professional contractors during the pandemic. Mr. Evans said he lost touch with his regular contractor customers in the spring because they were unable to work. “If they can’t get materials to build a deck for somebody, then what do they do?”

Contractor Lorant Tapaszi said while building product supply has been a major concern in his industry, it’s also hit employment. Many of his colleagues stopped working to collect CERB as it became more challenging to socially distance on jobs, he noted, whether to avoid risking infection or because of pandemic-related concerns like child care.

Homeowners are facing similar concerns in their renovation planning.

Zoe Nutten, a Toronto homeowner, had a renovation planned pre-pandemic that spanned two full floors of her house. However, in her executive position at work, she took a salary rollback and had to plan against receiving future bonuses. Coupled with what she said could be the “biggest recession we’ve ever seen,” she had to adjust renovation plans accordingly.

With the pandemic’s end nowhere in sight, she said, “we want to make sure we have a house that we want to be in, should this ever happen again.”

Health concerns have also shaped the scope of her family’s renovation plans. Ms. Nutten has had cancer since she was 27 years old, making her high-risk for COVID-19. As a result, Ms. Nutten said she is only dealing with contractors who have earned her trust. When one contractor showed up without a mask, she declined his services.

Despite country-wide changes to reno plans, Mr. Norman suspects contractors will bounce back after lockdown.

“There’s still quite a bit of activity going on,” he said. “But even if there’s a little bit of makeup extending as we go into the latter part of the year, we still think it’s going to be off by about 5 per cent in real terms this year.”

While Altus predicts a home renovation spending recovery in 2021, the potential for another coronavirus wave has left contractors and building suppliers scrambling to regain footing while they can.

Mr. Foreman described the current environment in the building supplies sector as “flying in a plane while you’re building it, and you’re not too sure what’s going to happen next.”

As for renovators: “Oh God, I really hope it will get better,” Mr. Tapaszi said. “I am confident it will. But when? And if there’s a second wave, how will that affect it? I don’t know.”

Open this photo in gallery The unit is in the roughly 40-year-old Carlisle building. Re/Max Excellence

The online listing for this newly renovated, two-bedroom-plus-den suite at the Carlisle building got a respectable 2,500 hits following its debut late December, but the seven-figure price tag and then the onslaught of the coronavirus pandemic cut in-person visits to the bone. Only two potential buyers made it through the door, with one offering $1.225-million in early May.

“In Edmonton, we average about 10 sales over $1-million every month in total – and condos are rarely one of those 10,” agent Clare Packer said.

“So, the luxury condo market in Edmonton is really quite small, especially now. There’s not a lot of activity in that market segment. That’s why this was the highest sale in the past six months.”

“There was another unit available [in the building] with a better view and better layout, but our unit sold first, likely because it was turnkey,” Ms. Packer said.

“It had chef-quality appliances, and the walnut detailing and custom cabinetry were both so high end – it’s something you’d see in a $3-million home. Then those details carried through the condo with walnut in the bathroom and accented in the den.”

It looks like a lot more people are riding bikes because of COVID, but I’m wondering if all those people know what the rules are. For example, I now see people riding bikes on sidewalks regularly. As a long-time cyclist, this really frustrates me. Are more people being charged? – Marcus, Montreal

They say you can never forget how to ride a bike. But a lot of us are pretty fuzzy when it comes to remembering the rules – if we learned them in the first place.

There are likely more new people on bikes in most Canadian cities right now. While weekday cycle trips were down by 10 per cent nationally in July compared to last year, there was a 23-per-cent increase in weekend trips, says Eco-Counter, a company that counts the number of bikes on roads and trails.

So, with people on bikes who are new to cycling or haven't ridden in years, might more people be breaking the rules?

Police in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver say they haven't seen an increase in tickets or complaints against cyclists.

""If there are actually more offences happening, it's hard for us to say,"" says Nathalie Valois, safety division officer with Montreal police. ""But we gave out fewer tickets this year.""

In April, May and June last year, Montreal police handed out 2,163 tickets to cyclists. In the same period this year, they handed out 991 tickets.

But despite fewer tickers, all cyclists could use a refresher about the rules, Valois says.

“For some, maybe it’s been a while since they’ve been on bicycles – or maybe they don’t know the rules,” Valois says.

Treat bikes like cars, mostly

Cyclists have to follow the rules of the road.

That means staying off sidewalks, stopping at stop signs and lights, following the direction of traffic and stopping for pedestrians in crosswalks.

In most provinces, cyclists are allowed to ride in car lanes as long as there's not a sign banning it – even when there's a dedicated bicycle lane.

""The one exception is that they cannot cycle in the middle of the street – they need to cycle to the right, close to the curb,"" Valois says. ""But the other rules are basically all the same as driving a car – if you know the rules for driving a car, you know the rules for riding a bike.""

One rule that surprises cyclists in Quebec? They can't ride with headphones.

""It's an offence, even with just one headphone,"" Valois says. ""This summer we have noticed that more cyclists are riding with them.""

In Vancouver, you're allowed to ride with one headphone, but not with two, Vancouver Police say.

“One that people don’t know much about is that wearing two headphones at the same time is not allowed,” said Const. Tania Visintin, Vancouver police spokesman, in an e-mail. “Riders must be able to hear at all times.”

While most other places in Canada don't ban wearing headphones while riding a bike, it's probably safer not to. Studies have shown that they can prevent cyclists from hearing approaching vehicles, especially electric cars and hybrids.

There are other rules that are unique to bicycles. In some provinces, including Ontario and British Columbia, cyclists are supposed to walk their bikes in crosswalks. B.C. and the Atlantic provinces require all cyclists to wear helmets. Alberta and Manitoba require helmets for riders under 18. Everywhere else, there's no helmet law.

Most sidewalk cyclists not scofflaws

There are times when cyclists might break rules – for instance, riding on a sidewalk – because it's safer than the alternative.

“Here in Montreal, we see people on the sidewalk because of road work or because cars are speeding,” Valois says. “Of course, if they’re new, they might be a bit uncomfortable or they might not know.”

Unless the rider is endangering pedestrians on a sidewalk, police might typically just give a warning instead of an $80 ticket, Valois says.

On some high-speed suburban roads without bike lanes, sometimes the sidewalks are the only safe place to ride, says Sabat Ismail, a Toronto-based cycling instructor.

“Some people wouldn’t cycle in certain places if they couldn’t cycle on the sidewalk,” Ismail says. “Be a good space-sharer and respect the other folks in the community.”

While riding on the sidewalk may be a stopgap solution when there are no protected bike lanes, it's ultimately not safe for cyclists or pedestrians, says Justin Jones, program manager with the Share the Road Cycling Coalition.

“A lot of people view sidewalks as a safe place to cycle, and they’re not,” says Jones. “When you’re on a sidewalk, every driveway is an intersection and sidewalks are not designed to make someone visible when they’re going the speed of a bike.”

Especially with COVID-19 and the need for personal distancing, cyclists need to leave sidewalks to pedestrians, Jones says.

“It’s vital that our limited sidewalk space be kept for people who are walking or using mobility devices,” Jones says.

It takes a wild imagination to envision Oro Station, a new racetrack, luxury car club and automotive industry hub being built in Oro Medonte, Ont. Not only is that because it’s an ambitious development the likes of which doesn’t exist in this country – nor, perhaps, in the world – but also because on this day in early August, the site is little more than 200-acres of grassy, overgrown farmland.

Driving an off-road buggy that’s kicking up a thick plume of dirt while bouncing across what will, eventually, become the racetrack’s pit-lane, is Geoffrey Campbell, managing partner of Oro Station. He must be doing nearly 100 km/h.

Campbell is a developer, managing partner at Oakleigh Developments, but he’s also a car fanatic and Oro Station is his baby. It’s something he’s been thinking about for 10 years. Now it’s starting to become real.

Campbell leans out of his buggy and points out where the main boulevard and pit building will be. “Imagine walking through this facility,” he says. “You’ve got a museum sitting here, you stopped by the cafe for coffee, the garage doors are open here where they’re working on a bunch of vintage Mustangs,” he says. Around the corner could be an autonomous car prototype in development, and down the road Porsche or BMW might be hosting a track day for prospective customers.

Campbell’s imagination is certainly powerful, but it’s a compelling vision and something that’s probably overdue in Ontario.

Premier Doug Ford attended the groundbreaking ceremony for Oro Station on August 20, along representatives from local, provincial and federal governments.

“There’s no reason why we can’t make our province the top destination for auto innovation and this project will help us maintain our position as leaders in the sector across North America,” Premier Ford said.

The 216-acre site is located between Barrie and Orillia, and will create 700 jobs, with roughly 300 on-site, according to an economic impact analysis commissioned by the developers. The project’s groundbreaking comes at a critical time for the province’s auto industry, which is dependent on auto makers investing here to develop and produce electric and automated cars.

What makes Oro Station unusual and unique is its vast range of intended uses; something like Disneyland meets Silicon Valley for all things automotive. It bills itself as “Ontario’s destination for the racers and restorers, the educators and innovators, the enthusiasts and entrepreneurs.” Campbell frequently mentions “community building” and “education.”

The site is approximately one hour north of Toronto, or maybe two hours in long-weekend traffic. The Lake Simcoe Regional Airport is across the street, so well-heeled track goers could fly in from anywhere in the U.S. or Canada, skipping traffic entirely.

The track itself will be 4.1 kilometres long and designed for modern GT and vintage racing cars; ex-Formula 1 driver Karun Chandhok has been driving laps in a simulator, helping to refine the circuit’s layout.

Kinrara Consulting, the firm behind the U.K.‘s spectacular Goodwood Festival of Speed, will help to organize events.

On north side of Oro Station will be the home of the Bexley Motor Club – something like a country club but full of people who aren’t annoyed by noisy cars but actually like them. There will be barn-style garages for stashing your classic cars and town houses so you can stay the weekend. A membership will cost around $100,000 for the initiation fee, Campbell says, adding that it’s about what you’d pay for a new set of wheels on a Bugatti Chiron. To buy a trackside ‘pied-à-terre’ will cost over a million dollars.

Private racetracks thrive near New York, Vancouver, L.A., and across Europe. Perhaps the only real surprise is that there isn’t already a place like this in Greater Toronto Area given the explosion of new wealth in recent years. In 2017, McLaren Toronto sold more McLarens than any other dealership in the world. In 2018, an enormous new Lamborghini, Rolls-Royce and Bentley dealership opened to keep up with booming demand.

“The minute anyone saw these barns [at the Bexley Motor Club] we got requests for up to 50 of them,” Campbell says. One customer wanted three, each with a helipad.

But, he stresses this won’t just be another gated playground for the ultra-rich. This exclusive car club is only half of Oro Station.

At the south end of the property is 500,000 square feet of industrial and event space that will host everything from research and development facilities for auto makers, suppliers and startups, to artisanal classic car restoration shops, to museums and restaurants and courtyards open to the public for car shows and events. Georgian College has partnered with Oro Station to expand its automotive and high-tech academic programs.

It won’t be quite like Goodwood; the public events will be much smaller and the circuit isn’t designed for spectators. Nevertheless, if it’s as advertised, a hub like this could help put Ontario on the car-culture map – not just the sales and manufacturing charts.

“What we’re trying to create is an ecosystem and environment that is geared around the passion in automotive,” says Campbell.

If this all sounds like a lot, it is; what it becomes in reality will depend on the tenants and businesses it can attract. Ambitious racetrack projects have come and gone in Ontario before. Campbell is used to people being skeptical.

“We’re now zoned, and that’s the biggest hurdle,” he says, leafing through a huge stack of detailed engineering drawings for the circuit. There is already approximately $10 million into this $150 million development. Formal agreements with tenants are in the works now.

With any luck, by this time in 2022, it won’t be off-road buggies but cars – hydrogen ones, electric ones, prototypes, exotics and classics – all speeding down the pit straight.

Fossil fools

Re Alberta Is Losing The Oil Sands PR War (Editorial, Aug. 13): The Globe and Mail’s editorial rightly points out that Canada’s carbon tax, aimed for $50 a tonne by 2022, is not a signal of major ambition. The government would need to increase the tax past 2022 to reach $210 a tonne by 2030 to meet its Paris targets, according to last year’s final report from Canada’s Ecofiscal Commission.

However, I find the editorial misses the mark in its argument that greening Alberta’s oil sands will somehow give it a shot in the global market. Oil sands are among the most expensive oil sources in the world. Its staying power has always depended on a high price a barrel, which is not happening any time soon, if ever, because of the oil glut caused by the pandemic, cheaper oil sources and clean energy growth, to name a few reasons.

Cheryl McNamara Toronto

“When asked about some international investors starting to shun the oil sands, Mr. Kenney declared it was a passing fad, the ‘flavour of the day.’”

My parents lived in a small coal-mining village in Yorkshire that had its heart ripped out by Margaret Thatcher 30 years ago. There was no “just transition” in those days.

Let not our fossil-fuel workers be led to disappointment and despair by fossil fools.

Re Site C Dam Underscores Need For More Time-sensitive Approach To Project Approvals (Aug. 13): I want to endorse contributor Adam Pankratz’s argument that to “prioritize local voices when gathering feedback” is essential, including for reducing excessively long timelines for project reviews. My experience in Canada’s pipeline industry confirms that a pre-regulatory, multi-stakeholder involvement process has unique value.

Story continues below advertisement

This type of sustained, inclusive process powerfully facilitates the earning of trust and strengthening of relationships, while better understanding and addressing local concerns. It does this through a meaningful sharing of control, as well as information, in an atmosphere of mutual respect.

This usually paves the way to a more calm, collaborative and technically informed discussion of all relevant issues.

Such stakeholder involvement tends to achieve dispute-resolution goals by combining the scientific rigour of environmental impact assessments, the economic rationality of cost-benefit analysis and the procedural fairness of quasi-judicial hearings, as well as the democratic and good neighbour principles of priority participation by representatives of communities most directly put at risk.

Re Canada Needs Its Own ‘Build Back Better’ Plan (Report on Business, Aug. 14): Contributor Robert Asselin calls on the Canadian government to match Joe Biden’s industrial policy framework with one of its own. If someone wrote a book about Canadian industrial policies over the past several decades, I believe they would find big outlays of public funds, jobs for friends of the government and firms that received public funds being bought out by U.S. companies, happy to benefit from Canadian subsidies.

Every incoming government claims they have the secret for Canadian economic development. Arthur Kruger, the arch-mandarin with several deputy minister jobs on his CV once said that what Canadian governments should do is limit themselves to providing the infrastructure – good transportation, education and so on – and leave the rest to the private sector.

Current industrial policies deserve some responsibility for the low level of Canadian productivity – about 25 per cent lower than the United States.

CRA insecurity

Re Thousands Of CRA, Government Service Accounts Disabled By Cyberattacks (Aug. 17): Government services have been pushing people to sign up for online accounts for years. To increase the online take up, the Treasury Board of Canada simplified the process by getting people to access federal services with a unique GCKey credential. To make it even easier, you can register for those services by using your banking credentials. This is a tremendous technical fit! One login and one password can now give people online access to all those banking and government services.

The Treasury Board says now that the recent attacks “took advantage of the fact that many people reuse passwords and usernames across multiple accounts.” Do you see the paradox? They blame Canadians for reusing their login and password, but also enabled a system that does just that: same unique credentials for a large number of critical services.

Whoever dreamed of the GCKey system must surely work with the best security experts. Except they forgot the golden rule: In IT security, the weakest link is the person behind the keyboard. If everyone is pushed online by their government, access needs to be designed for the most tech-vulnerable people, not the tech savvy. But do not hold your breath, because the GCKey system will stay even if it is dangerous for my grandmother.

Camp X security

Re Canadian Women’s Army Corps Created (Moment in Time, Aug. 13): My aunt Cecile didn’t join the Canadian Women’s Army Corps. But in the spring of 1942, she did approach Tommy Drew-Brook, the Canadian director of British Security Co-ordination, in the same Toronto building where she worked as a teller. She offered her considerable clerical skills to assist in the war effort.

By June, after a thorough review of her background by the RCMP, she was ensconced at Camp X, enciphering and decoding BSC messages and cables for the famous Hydra coding machine.

One day in the 1970s, she revealed to me that she went through the basic training all Camp X “agents” received. So, her superiors considered her qualified to move to Manhattan, where she sat outside the office of BSC chief Sir William Stephenson for the rest of the war, doing “clerical work” while guarding the door! She was only 27.

Re CFL’s Board To Discuss Fate Of Season After Bid For Federal Loan Falls Through, Sources Say (Aug. 17): Our government has no problem giving WE $43-million to dole out just less than $1-billion for a kids’ volunteer program, but it can’t give the CFL a $30-million interest-free loan.

Riley Brandt/The Canadian Press

Village Brewery, which describes its blond ale as crisp, dry and slightly fruity, is looking to persuade beer lovers that a new batch made from reused waste water tastes just as good.

The Calgary beer-maker has teamed up with University of Calgary researchers and U.S. water technology company Xylem Inc. to brew up a limited 1,600-can batch.

The goal was to show that dirty water – even that flushed from toilets in a major city – can be made safe to drink while helping conserve the globe’s dwindling potable water supply.

“Certainly we do expect some eyebrows raised and the yuck factor is real,” said Christine O’Grady, project co-ordinator at Advancing Canadian Wastewater Assets, or ACWA.

“Part of this project … is to start the conversation about how this can be done, why it should be done and that water is a resource that we need to protect.”

ACWA is a research partnership between the University of Calgary and the City of Calgary that involves the Pine Creek Wastewater Treatment Facility by the Bow River in the city’s southeast.

Municipal waste water normally runs through a complex system involving screens, filters, microbes and ultraviolet light to make it clean enough to return to the river.

The ACWA team took partially treated water from the plant and ran it through more advanced purifying to make it drinkable. That involved ultrafiltration, ozone, ultraviolet light and reverse osmosis.

The idea of making beer from waste water started out as a joke around the boardroom table while Xylem and ACWA were discussing ways to collaborate.

“Then we said, ‘Well, we can make beer,’” Ms. O’Grady said. “We have all the technology. We have the capacity on all sides.”

ACWA approached Village Brewery.

“They’re so progressive and cool. They were all in,” said Ms. O’Grady.

Jackson Stuart, the brewery’s marketing manager, said Village was excited to take part in a project that put sustainability front and centre.

He said he’ll be interested to see how keen customers are to sip suds brewed from repurposed waste water.

“The big thing for us was to try to make sure that the beer tasted the exact same as our other normal Village Blonde and we achieved that,” he said. “We’re confident.”

The only difference in making the beer is that the water didn’t come from the tap, but arrived in tanks.

Alberta Health Services helped the partners develop a safety plan and tested the treated water to make sure it met drinking-water standards.

“With the right measures in place, alternative water sources – such as waste water, grey water, rooftop-collected rainwater and stormwater – can be made safe for many potable and non-potable end uses,” said public-health inspector Jessica Popadynetz.

Bob Sandford, Global Water Futures Chair at the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health, said he believes the “yuck factor” can be overcome.

“The science is absolutely sound and is very convincing. The brewery, too, has done a really good job of explaining this,” he said.

Natural systems have been purifying water to a drinkable standard for hundreds of millions of years, Mr. Sandford said.

“We’re drinking water that’s passed through dinosaurs.”

In a changing climate and an increasingly populated world, high-level tertiary treatment technologies such as those used by ACWA will be crucial, he suggested.

“Because of the numbers of emerging contaminants of concern, we need to have ever more sophisticated water treatment systems and this is what it’s pointing to.”

Firefighters struggled to contain three wildfires near Los Angeles on Saturday as forecasters warned that the risk of new fires was high with temperatures expected to spike and humidity levels to drop across California.

A huge forest fire that prompted evacuations north of Los Angeles flared up around noon, sending up a cloud of smoke as it headed toward thick, dry brush in the Angeles National Forest. Although it was burning into forest land, evacuation orders remained in effect for the western Antelope Valley because erratic winds in the forecast could push the fire toward homes, fire spokesman Jake Miller said.

Fire crews managed to stop the fire’s movement down to the desert floor when it flared up Friday afternoon. In one dramatic moment, several firefighters ran to safety when a longhorn bull that was apparently escaping the blaze charged at them.

The Lake Fire was just 12% contained as of Saturday morning, and after threatening more than 5,400 homes, it had charred more than 23 square miles (59.5 square kilometres) of brush and trees. Fire officials said 21 buildings had been destroyed, including at least five homes.

Firefighters were struggling in steep, rugged terrain amid scorching temperatures. The National Weather Service warned temperatures could hit 111 degrees (44 Celsius) in the Antelope Valley Saturday, and winds gusting 15-20 mph (24-32 kph) was expected later in the afternoon.

“In addition to that, we have a very unstable air mass over the Lake Fire that’s going to allow for a pyrocumulus (cloud) development later today so that will create extreme fire behaviour,” meteorologist Matt Mehle said.

Record-breaking heat is possible through the weekend, with triple-digit temperatures and unhealthy air predicted for many parts of the state. There also was a chance of isolated thunderstorms worsening the fire threat by creating dry lightning and strong downdrafts, fire officials said

There was no containment of a blaze that blackened foothills above the Los Angeles suburb of Azusa. It churned through 2.3 square miles (5.96 square kilometres) of brush on Thursday and was moving away from homes. Evacuation orders issued to residents were lifted early Friday.

Azusa police said they were looking for a homeless man suspected of starting the fire. He was identified as Osmin Palencia, 36, and was last known to be living in a riverbed encampment near the site where the fire started.

Police said Palencia was believed to be violent and urged people to use caution if they see him.

Another blaze came dangerously close to a neighbourhood in the city of Corona, east of Los Angeles, before crews controlled it. And a Northern California fire in the community of Sloughhouse, near Sacramento, burned about 500 acres (202 hectares) before firefighters stopped its forward spread."

Conservative crush

Re O’Toole Reaches Out To Liberal, NDP Voters After ‘True Blue’ Campaign Wins Him Leadership (Aug. 25): Without a further-right party to cluster the social conservatives and climate-change deniers, Erin O’Toole’s Tories seem destined for permanent residency in opposition.

And if the Liberals dump their biggest liability – the Prime Minister, in my mind – they could guarantee a massive majority. That could also spare us the agony of watching Chrystia Freeland having to apologize for his actions.

Re Where Is The Government Campaign To Support The COVID Alert App? (Opinion, Aug. 22): I suggest it would be much wiser and cheaper to rely on monetary incentives as distinct from “a major public awareness and marketing campaign,” which would presumably consist of pious exhortations that are likely to be ignored.

Just enter everyone who has downloaded the app into a draw, and hand out a prize of $25,000 every two weeks. News of the prize would spread rapidly through word of mouth and social media. I’m confident that the target reach of 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the population would be attained in no time.

I’m equally confident that the savings in health costs would far exceed the upfront outlay.

Re Flu Season Threatens To Make Coping With Coronavirus Far Worse (Opinion, Aug. 22): While I appreciate that new flus may be emerging in Asia, I don’t see the risk of the “usual” flu season for several reasons.

World travel is way down, so the usual spread vector should be much reduced. Most people are controlling their contact with respiratory viruses through physical distancing and mask-wearing. These measures are new to a flu season.

However, we should not be complacent. The threat of a double whammy should be leveraged to encourage everyone to keep staying safe.

Climate clash

A letter writer from Toronto opines about “a new vision for Alberta’s economic future (Oil Opinions – Letters, Aug. 23),” a reminder of another Toronto letter writer’s lament that “if Alberta would only realize that the rest of the country is trying to help it climb out of a fossil-fuel hole and achieve clean prosperity (Change For Climate Change – Letters, July 17).” There certainly seems to be a view that the Canadian climate file is fundamentally an Alberta issue, and that solutions will come most readily through capitulation to the self-righteousness of a certain Toronto mindset.

It is a mindset that seems to think Albertans produce carbon for sport, that it is some kind of recreational activity for a population addled by avarice. The last time I checked, Albertans produce carbon because people all over the country, indeed the continent, want to consume it.

For those offended by Alberta’s carbon preoccupations, there is a simple solution: Stop buying the stuff. As it stands, too many Canadians seem to think that climate-change piety can be achieved by simply opposing a pipeline, or advocating for the destruction of a provincial economy – just as long as it is not their own.

Climate change is a problem of consumption, not supply. It’s a problem that all Canadians should take ownership of, and one that will likely not be addressed solely by what Alberta does.

Re The Tories’ Choice Of Leader Doesn’t Matter – Not As Much As What The Party Does Next (Aug. 22): Not being a supporter of the Conservatives, I am actually quite happy to have them ignore, or even deny, our most important crisis in climate change. Then other parties who do recognize its threat may attract more Gen X and millennial voters, and hopefully be elected to make effective contributions toward keeping the planet livable for our children and grandchildren.

On the other hand, if the Conservatives do form our next government, what disasters await us?

Re Sound Of The Police (Letters, Aug. 24): One doesn’t need to think that police are saints to recognize the benefits of criminology students interning with them. A letter writer seems to think that once students are in police clutches, they will be powerless against police influence. But if Carleton University is doing its job, students will have been taught to think critically.

Since no one is ever completely objective, I believe it is almost always better to know how an organization works in practice when critiquing it, rather than how an academic thinks it works in theory.

Something old, something new

Re The Château Laurier Will Change. But Will Ottawa? (Online, Aug. 19): Architecture critic Alex Bozikovic, in making a case for adding modern architecture to old buildings, mentions the Louvre. The French museum’s iconic glass pyramid is on the grounds of the building, but not attached to it – an important distinction. If the pyramid was connected to the wonderful stone facade of the Louvre, there would likely be an outrage in Paris.

The proposed addition to the Château Laurier would see wonderful, old-world architecture fixed to a modern structure. The hotel is a landmark because of its architecture, and the new design would turn it into a head-scratching oddity. It would elicit a frequent comment: “Why did they do that?”

As Frank Lloyd Wright said: “A doctor can bury his mistakes, but an architect can only advise his client to plant vines.”

SEAN KILPATRICK/AFP/Getty Images

When COVID-19 hit, a lot of people started describing it as this generation’s version of a war. Canada has not faced a threat like this, or had to borrow money and mobilize resources to this extent, since the Second World War.

If the aftermath of today’s war is anything like the previous one, then the Conservative Party, and its new leader Erin O’Toole, are in for a challenge. It’s what the Liberals – preparing what’s expected to be an activist Speech from the Throne next month and a dare to the other parties to vote it down – are counting on.

History doesn’t repeat, but it often rhymes. The hardships of the Great Depression and the war that followed changed Canada and Canadians’ attitudes. Most voters did not want to go back to the laissez-faire 1920s. They wanted better social programs, a wider safety net and the protections of a more activist government. The Liberals, fearfully eyeing the increasingly popular movement that would go on to become the New Democratic Party, promised the beginnings of the modern welfare state.

They were rewarded with 22 consecutive years in power, from 1935 to 1957.

The conservatives, in contrast, were uncomfortable with these newfangled ideas. Unfortunately for them, not enough voters felt the same way. Today’s true-blue heartland of Western Canada was a conservative dead zone. John Diefenbaker, who for years before becoming prime minister was the party’s lone Saskatchewan MP, used to joke that Tories were an endangered species on the Prairies, only kept from extinction by the hunting laws.

Canada’s history is one of voters changing their minds and even their most deeply held beliefs, and of the makeup of the population evolving, often rapidly. The Conservative Party’s challenge has been that, as its name suggests, it has usually been the party least eager to change. But it has still done so.

The conservatives were long the party opposed to free trade with the United States, while the Liberals were supportive; by the 1980s, the script had flipped. And while conservatives have always seen themselves as the party of patriotism, until the 1960s that nationalism was rooted in a tie to Britain and a disappearing empire, and included opposition to the Maple Leaf flag.

Since the 1980s, when Brian Mulroney’s Tories chose to dramatically increase immigration, Canada has been on a path of steady demographic transformation. A country that was once almost entirely white isn’t anymore and it’s becoming less so every day; a country that was once heavily rural is overwhelmingly urban and suburban and that process also continues. Conservatives can get ahead of those facts or find themselves left behind.

In the 2019 election, the Conservatives were entirely shut out of Greater Montreal and almost completely shut out of the Greater Toronto Area. Mr. O’Toole occupies one of the GTA’s few Tory seats, in Durham, a partly rural riding on the edge of the region.

Beyond demographics, the ideological centre of politics may also be shifting, as it did in the 1930s and 40s. The flood of pandemic spending may be temporary, but its fact – and its size, speed and effectiveness – have testified and given impetus to the possibilities of government doing more to promote welfare and to lower poverty and inequality.

The country that Tories failed to win over in 2019 may be a different place today, in ways that further disadvantage a party that Stephen Harper branded as dedicated to government as an exercise in permanent downsizing.

Conservatives should be carefully studying the surprising evolution of Doug Ford’s Ontario government. Elected two years ago with a populist image, the Ontario Premier has suddenly started talking and acting like one. Instead of fretting about emergency spending, he’s done what’s necessary. Instead of seeking out enemies, he’s sounded like a conciliator. The man’s appeal has always transcended race, but now he’s even earned the respect of many voters on the centre-left. The long-time bogeyman for Liberal and NDP voters has been entirely de-bogeymanified.

That’s what Mr. O’Toole’s Tories have to do to themselves. In 2019, the best argument for voting Liberal was the fear of a Conservative government. When your existence is your opponent’s best get-out-the-vote strategy, you need to rethink not just your sales pitch, but your substance.

Re Erin O’Toole Wins Federal Conservative Leadership Race (Online, Aug. 24): I see that Erin O’Toole brings the same old background to federal politics. He is a lawyer and the son of a politician (and also born in Quebec). To win the Conservative leadership, he beat out Peter MacKay, a lawyer and the son of a politician. For a country that champions diversity, it certainly is not reflected in those seeking the highest office of the land.

Re Canadians Risk Becoming Addicted To Aid (Aug. 21): I suspect the authors have never needed government income supports. I suggest they speak to Canadians whose jobs have been wiped out by COVID-19 before claiming to address “this particular moral hazard.”

Vicki Nash-Moore Waterloo, Ont.

Should we really fret about disincentives to work? I appreciate that, for some, Reaganomics has become so orthodox as to be invisible.

The authors might do well to reflect on John Kenneth Galbraith’s incisive demolition of that orthodoxy: “We can safely abandon the doctrine of the eighties, namely that the rich were not working because they had too little money, the poor because they had too much.”

I, for one, am grateful to be warned that putting food on the table and keeping a roof over one’s head are, in fact, risky behaviours to be avoided.

Kate Lawson Kitchener, Ont.

It is clear from various basic income trials since the 1800s, and the new World Bank report Exploring Universal Basic Income, that people handle the “moral hazard” of a guaranteed income quite effectively. They prefer to work when reasonably paid work is available or use the opportunity to acquire skills that lead to more interesting work.

We should be more worried about executives in companies that experienced relatively little revenue loss, yet readily accepted wage subsidies of 75 per cent. Talk to the 1 per cent about moral hazard!

Alan Ball New Westminster, B.C.

I find the outdated notion that people who receive government assistance will refuse to work to be, frankly, classist.

Over the course of my working career, I dealt with many hundreds of underemployed and unemployed people. At most there may have been 5 per cent who were content to do nothing. The rest not only wanted to work, but were uneasy about not working while receiving income support.

The majority of people are hard-wired to do useful, necessary work to support themselves and their families. The authors’ suggestion, that income supports somehow eradicate this basic human need, reads to me like misguided fiction.

Trust the police?

Re Ontario Pledges $25-million For New Police Officers (Aug. 21): After a summer of protests against police violence and calls for defunding forces, Ontario responds by adding money. I don’t believe we need more police – we need less.

We should retrain police. We should add specialized intervention teams, such as medical personnel, to deal with many of the calls currently attended by police. We should completely overhaul our forces and our system of policing. We should stop this senseless spending on something that is often racist and intolerant.

There are great cops, but unfortunately the current training, the blue line and the sense of privilege seem to do so much harm that far overshadows any good actions.

Re Body-cam Video Of Ujiri’s NBA Finals Encounter Will Only Further Erode Public Trust In Police (Sports, Aug. 20): The original behaviour of the cop, the subsequent lies and deliberate misdirection – those are what I believe will erode public trust in police. While the altercation on the court was bad enough, it is the subsequent perversion of justice by the people meant to ensure it that worries me most.

The big question

Re Ending Fatphobia Isn’t Enough – We Need To Stop Pathologizing Obesity (Aug. 21): I am increasingly puzzled as to how we should view obesity.

Some used to explain it in terms of personal lack of restraint. But that would be blaming the person. Instead, we have been encouraged to think of it as a pathology, caused occasionally by genetic factors and more frequently by social and environmental ones.

Now, contributors Michael Orsini and Deborah McPhail tell us that we should not think of it as a pathology either. In fact, we should stop thinking about weight as a measure of health.

But isn’t there research that links obesity to a variety of health problems? It may not be the only measure, or an infallible one, but surely it often matters. Although no expert, my version of common sense suggests the mix of causes varies from person to person and can include any or all of the factors people commonly talk about.

In terms of solutions, then – assuming solutions are required – one size will surely not fit all.

Oliver Contreras/The New York Times News Service

Another week, another miracle cure.

On Sunday night, U.S. President Donald Trump was at it again, claiming a “historic breakthrough in our fight against the China virus.”

This time he was touting convalescent plasma, issuing an emergency authorization that allows for the drug to be used without having to go through the normal regulatory process to demonstrate it is safe and effective.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Trump has done this twice before during the pandemic, with hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir, neither of which proved to be even remotely as beneficial as he claimed.

This time around, the President claimed that antibody-rich plasma (which is harvested from people who have recovered from COVID-19) “is proven to reduce mortality by 35 per cent.”

To make matters worse, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration went along with the charade. Its press release described convalescent plasma as a “potential promising COVID-19 treatment” and “another achievement in the administration’s fight against the pandemic.”

That is a new low for the once-respected agency, whose scientists know full well that the claim that plasma treatments cut the death rate by 35 per cent is unsubstantiated nonsense.

In fact, a study conducted at the Mayo Clinic, which included 35,000 patients, found that those who received a transfusion of convalescent plasma within three days of diagnosis had a death rate of 8.7 per cent, while those who received the same treatment after four or more days had a mortality rate of 11.9 per cent.

Did plasma save lives when given earlier? Maybe. But those treated early were not chosen randomly, and we have no idea what the death rate was among those who did not get treatment. We know that plasma collected from COVID-19 survivors is rich in antibodies, but we don’t know if those antibodies are neutralizing, meaning they can block infection or lessen the harms.

That’s why clinical trials are important: They help us figure out the effectiveness and safety of treatments. One of those important trials is under way in Canada. Paradoxically, the emergency authorization will make it far more difficult to do those studies because plasma can now be prescribed willy-nilly.

Story continues below advertisement

But Mr. Trump is in a hurry. His administration has launched Operation Warp Speed to get treatments and vaccines to market as rapidly as possible. That process, however, has become so politicized that it is a menace.

The promotion of dubious drugs is only a beginning. What Mr. Trump really wants is to approve a vaccine before the Nov. 3 presidential election so he can claim victory over COVID-19 despite his abysmal handling of the pandemic since Day 1. (The U.S now has almost 5.8 million confirmed cases and 180,000 deaths.)

While a vaccine is desperately needed to control the pandemic, the only thing worse than no vaccine would be one that is ineffective or harmful. It’s far more important to get it right than do it quickly. We need strong clinical evidence, not artificial election day deadlines.

There’s a certain irony in Mr. Trump, who has often aligned himself with anti-vaccine activists and other conspiracy theorists, now counting on a vaccine to be his golden ticket to re-election.

But don’t be fooled. The President is staunchly anti-science. He doesn’t want a vaccine as much as he wants his followers to swallow whatever pablum he is serving them.

During the previous presidential campaign, Mr. Trump made journalists the enemy, with his destructive rhetoric about “fake news.”

His latest tactic is to undermine scientific expertise for partisan political purposes. In the Trumpian world, everyone’s opinion is equally valid, no matter how ill-informed or self-serving.

When the President routinely promotes drugs, or suggests people should inject bleach, when he uses racist terms such as “China virus,” or when he calls the coronavirus pandemic a hoax, it is all part-and-parcel of an egregious pattern of ignoring, sidelining and undermining science and research.

On the weekend, Mr. Trump showed his true colours, attacking the FDA (the agency that was bullied into the convalescent plasma announcement) as part of the “deep state” bureaucracy that is trying to undermine his re-election.

Politics are not holding up better COVID-19 treatments. If anything, politics are pushing people to embrace unproven and potentially dangerous treatments.

The President claims to be cutting red tape, but his bumbling forays into medical prescribing are much more sinister.

His snake oil salesman approach is not about getting better treatments to people, it’s craven politicking that undermines the scientific enterprise and erodes democracy.

Kwame McKenzie is the CEO of the Wellesley Institute.

In Canada’s first wave of COVID-19, more than 80 per cent of deaths were elderly people in long-term care. In the next wave, homelessness and housing will be the locus.

More than 250,000 people experience homelessness in Canada in a normal year. Emergency measures such as provincial eviction moratoriums and municipalities renting hotel space to house those experiencing homelessness have helped stave off the worst effects of COVID-19 so far. But as eviction protections are eased, people move out of temporary shelter accommodation and the economic downturn bites, we expect the numbers living on the streets, in shelters and tent cities to increase. One in four tenants are worried about making rent this month.

These are people not just numbers. They include people with disabilities, people suffering from mental illness, war veterans, women and families fleeing violence, LGBTQ2S+ youth leaving difficult households, Indigenous people, newcomers and families who never thought they could be homeless but who have lost their income because of the pandemic.

And this increase in homelessness will come just as Spain and France have signalled that the second wave is coming and British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba are seeing upticks in cases.

Low incomes and high rates of existing illness make people experiencing homelessness a high-risk group for COVID-19. The ability to self-isolate and distance are the cornerstones of COVID-19 protection. Homelessness takes away that ability. Urgent action on homelessness is a necessary – and effective – part of a pandemic strategy.

We need to build on the successes of the first wave and act now to avoid a catastrophe in the second.

In the first wave of COVID-19, heroic efforts successfully averted a public-health crisis. Hotels, motels and other empty buildings were converted so that people experiencing homelessness could isolate safely. Crowded, dormitory-style shelters were emptied out to enable physical distancing and their occupants relocated to spaces where they could have a room, bathroom and door with a lock.

Federal money through the Reaching Home program, along with support from provincial and municipal governments, made this possible. The result: The rate of COVID-19 spread flattened among people experiencing homelessness and, as people were settled into more dignified spaces, their mental health improved. When society shows it will not leave you behind, the world looks very different.

But these efforts were time limited. Urgent investments are needed if the efforts of the first wave are not to be wasted. Federal Reaching Home funds need to be renewed immediately to maintain the response and prepare for the second wave. We need to solidify gains and prepare for a second wave.

We must also build on and improve on what works. The temporary spaces that achieved distancing for those experiencing homelessness should be converted to permanent options. The creation of an acquisition fund through the National Housing Strategy could enable municipalities, non-profits and community organizations to buy properties, including hotels and motels. These would create immediate and long-term solutions for people experiencing, or at imminent risk, of homelessness.

A new acquisition fund could combine with the existing National Housing Co-Investment Fund to have an even deeper impact. The acquisition fund would pay for the purchase and the co-investment fund would help renovate purchased sites or convert existing dormitory shelters into individualized spaces more suitable for a pandemic.

An acquisition fund would be a cost-effective use of public money: It creates permanent assets that are immediately available to shelter our most marginalized. If community organizations own, rather than rent, they have more money to provide supports for residents. This leads to better outcomes for residents and improves relations with neighbours. And housing can promote economic growth – for instance, studies have shown that for every $1 invested in housing construction, there is a $1.52 multiplier effect on the local economy.

With homelessness on the rise and the second wave looming, we need to act now to avert a disaster. We have come a long way and made many gains during this pandemic. We need to take the opportunity to build on our success and invest in solutions we know work. An acquisition fund and a renewed Reaching Home program will do this. We cannot afford to squander this chance.

SEAN KILPATRICK/POOL/Reuters

Andrew MacDougall is a director at Trafalgar Strategy and a former head of communications to prime minister Stephen Harper.

If you want to understand how much the Conservative Party of Canada has changed since its inception, look no further than the fate of Peter MacKay, one of the men who birthed the party 17 years ago. Mr. MacKay is smarting today after watching Erin O’Toole skate away with the trophy that so many predicted was his at the start of the race for the Conservative Party leadership. It wasn’t quite missing an open goal on a breakaway, but it still counts as a spectacular failure. Mr. MacKay was both outsmarted and outworked, but in the end, Mr. O’Toole won because he understood a core truth about his party better than his rival: that the Conservative Party of Canada is no longer the coalition of Progressive Conservatives and Reformists it was when Stephen Harper took the united party’s helm in 2004. The current coalition looks much different: It is more mistrustful of Bay Street and institutions and more in tune with the struggles of smaller communities.

That was illustrated by third-place finisher Leslyn Lewis’s second-ballot victory in the popular vote. And while critics will snark that Ms. Lewis was only a stalking horse for the party’s significant social-conservative support, this view ignores Ms. Lewis’s significant appeal across the country. There’s a reason so many preferred her to Derek Sloan, the other out-and-out social conservative: A lot of Conservatives clearly liked what they saw in the positive, confident, immigrant Black female Toronto lawyer. Her mere candidacy helps chip away at the myth the Conservative Party is inherently hostile to any or all of these things.

Alas, that narrative lingers in many places, including in the press – and for good reason. If Mr. O’Toole is to make the most of his leadership, he must work quickly to debunk it at every opportunity.

Here, Mr. O’Toole’s understanding of the modern Conservative Party might give him more leeway as he seeks to broaden the party’s appeal. Mr. O’Toole certainly played to the Conservative base with some of his campaign pledges, such as defunding the CBC, but he’s savvy enough to know that the angry, ranty image of the party – typified by outgoing leader Andrew Scheer’s chippy farewell speech – doesn’t play well enough to get the Conservatives back into power. He’ll need a more compelling and mature offer.

Thankfully, Mr. O’Toole seems willing to grasp this nettle. “We must continue to point out Liberal failings and corruption,” he said in his late-night victory speech. “But we must also show Canadians our vision for a stronger, more prosperous and more united Canada.” Amen. As tempting as it might be to focus on the current Liberal mess with WE Charity, he is correct to prescribe more emphasis on constructing a distinct road map for where the country should go now as it recovers from the novel coronavirus and its continuing effects. Justin Trudeau, after all, has already prorogued Parliament so as to turn his government’s resources to this important task.

The trick for Mr. O’Toole will be to apply conservative principles to Canada’s current problems and not just offer up Liberal-lite fare, as many Conservatives clearly feared Mr. MacKay would have. He must find a way to put family, fairness, hard work and dignity together in a way that doesn’t spell either severe cuts or billions in new spending. It’s a big ask on a potentially tight timeline, with a Prime Minister who is clearly spoiling for a fight.

Fortunately – or, rather, sadly – the opportunity is there for a new approach. The pandemic has demonstrated that a lot of what Canadians thought were solid foundations are actually shifting sands. Flexible, low-paid work – once the preserve of those without education or who are new to the country – is now the reality for millions of highly educated Canadians, many of whom are entering what should be their prime earning years. Getting the policy prescriptions right to reverse these trends as the virus recedes would appeal to both immigrant communities such as Ms. Lewis’s, as well as the younger voters in cities that Conservatives have spent years turning off.

It won’t be easy. But this is where the other great quality demonstrated by Mr. O’Toole in the leadership race – hard work – will pay off. To outskate Mr. MacKay, the Member of Parliament for Durham sized up his task, devised a plan to accomplish it and then worked relentlessly until he delivered.

But there is no rest for the weary. Mr. O’Toole must now repeat his trick on a much grander stage.

Re Freeland Excels At Fixing Things. Why Is She Not In Charge? (Opinion, Aug. 22): Speculating about a political leader’s motives may be a mug’s game. But such speculation is also a raison d’etre of columnists, opinion editors and letter-writers.

I’ll risk being a mug and suggest that Justin Trudeau’s choice of Chrystia Freeland as Finance Minister was a clever move designed to forestall a non-confidence defeat in Parliament and shore up support when an election is finally called. Voters might overlook Mr. Trudeau’s scandals if they see the loss of Ms. Freeland as too high a price for a change of government.

Re Who Needs Parliament? Not Trudeau (Editorial, Aug. 20): The Globe and Mail’s editorial focused on Justin Trudeau and not his government. I find that the government has performed excellently in keeping Canadians safe from COVID-19 and providing them with financial assistance during this difficult time.

Canadians should be proud of federal and provincial leaders for their collective efforts to save us. The next focus should be on the revival of the economy and the continuous improvement of health care.

Gurcharan Singh Bhatia CM, Edmonton

Voters returned a Parliament where, between the Liberals, NDP and Green Party, government should have a mandate to take bold action on the environmental and social fronts. If the next Throne Speech contains enough to satisfy those opposition parties, the government should be able to retain the confidence of Parliament.

Remember all the great advances achieved under the Pearson minority government.

Re Globe Analysis Finds Wide Variation In Police Funding, With Forces Accounting For A Third Of Some City Budgets and For Many Advocates Of Cutting Police Funding, Doing So Is Hard – Even When Municipalities Are On Side (Aug. 17): In unpacking the byzantine budget permutations of municipal police forces, the inexorable rise in their operating budgets compared with many decreases for social services, and the seeming inability of municipal governments to change that paradigm, reporters Patrick White, Tom Cardoso and Molly Hayes highlight the substantive challenges involved in calls to defund police forces.

“We deliver a service that relies on people interacting with people,” said the president of the Canadian Police Association. Unfortunately for some citizens, that interaction is often not a positive one and could turn violent or even deadly.

Considering the power that chiefs of police hold to expand their forces without reasonable checks by elected politicians, perhaps those positions should also be elected by municipal citizens. Should they not be judged by their outcomes to serve and protect – not just by some, but all citizens equally?

Re Slammed Shut (Letters, Aug. 17): A number of letter-writers criticize Carleton University criminologists for ending student internships with police. I assume they think that it won’t affect their objectivity on police policy.

I am tired of people assuming that police are saints and that it is insulting to examine their policies. They work for us and we should be looking objectively at how they police us, not ingratiating ourselves into their culture.

Re The Army Should Relaunch Canada’s Student Grant Program (Aug. 18): I believe contributor Graeme Menzies’s opinion is right on target. The Department of National Defence has the facilities, the experience and the talent.

Those of my generation – youth of the 1950s and 60s – will remember the University Naval Training Division, the Reserve Officers University Training Plan and the Canadian Officers Training Corp. I fondly remember the UNTD, known colloquially as the “Untidies.” The program gave me one of the richest, and most transformative, experiences of my undergraduate years.

Over four five-month summers, I lived with other young trainees from across Canada. I learned seamanship, pilotage and celestial navigation, ship husbandry and leadership; I went to sea in a variety of ships, steamed on both the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans. The navy even offered courses in international current affairs, where I experienced some of the finest instructors in my whole university career.

The program paid for studies at a civilian university and provided a commission in the armed forces without any obligation to serve, although many of us did. It was not only an exercise in discipline and life skills, but an investment in nation-building.

Under a new PPSC directive, anyone caught with illegal drugs in places frequented by children or teens, or who works with youths, will still be prosecuted. So will those carrying a weapon along with their stash, as will people caught with drugs in isolated communities that are trying to curb misuse. Traffickers will also still face the full weight of the law.

But a person arrested for the possession of a small amount of illegal narcotics intended for personal use will no longer automatically be prosecuted – especially if the person has a substance-use disorder.

Story continues below advertisement

Even a person out on bail who violates conditions that prohibit drug use or possession will not be prosecuted, according to the new guidelines.

This is a step in the direction toward a more sensible and workable solution to Canada’s opioid crisis, and to substance misuse in general. It’s not the final step – much more needs to be done – but, given the reluctance of Ottawa and most of the provinces to seriously address this issue, it is welcome.

It’s also overdue. Canadian police chiefs, as well as public-health officials and policy makers, have been calling for the decriminalization of simple drug possession for some time. This page has also repeatedly pushed for it.

Advocates for decriminalization don’t want illegal drugs to become legal and available for sale in stores, the way cannabis and alcohol are in Canada. Far from it.

But as the death toll from opioid overdoses climbs by the hour in this country, and in some places outstrips the fatality rate of COVID-19, continuing to prosecute addicts and hoping that the criminal justice system will somehow magically cure them of their dependencies has proved to be a flop.

Last year alone, 3,823 people died in Canada from suspected opioid overdoses, according to federal government data, and 4,435 were hospitalized. Almost all of the deaths were accidental, and three-quarters of them involved street drugs that were laced with fentanyl, a powerful opioid that can kill a person in small amounts.

This year has seen record monthly opioid-related death counts in British Columbia and Toronto, and a spike in Alberta. The COVID-19 crisis appears to be making the situation worse, by prompting addicts to use drugs in isolation, away from anyone who could help them if they overdose.

Story continues below advertisement

The last thing addicts need is to be further marginalized by a criminal record for drug possession, and to do time behind bars, where there is little possibility of treatment. What they desperately need is to be directed into the health care system, into restorative justice, into a Drug Treatment Court, or down some other path that can help them get over their substance-use disorder.

The new directive from the PPSC will help this happen. Some see it as a half-measure, since people possessing small amounts of illegal drugs for personal use will still be arrested by police and put through the courts.

But at least prosecutors can now redirect these cases away from the criminal justice system and into treatment. Plus, with time, police will likely stop laying charges for simple possession and start to divert users to places that can help them – something that some Canadian police departments are already doing.

This is why there is so much more to be done. The provinces don’t even have a consistent record on creating supervised drug consumption sites, where people can use drugs in the presence of medical personnel who can save them if they overdose, and also gently direct them into treatment. Cities such as Toronto have had to beg for help that has been slow in coming.

In the meantime, Canadian police chiefs, Canadian public-health experts and now Canada’s federal prosecutors have all recognized that drug addicts don’t belong in the criminal justice system.

Ottawa and the provinces pay lip service to the idea, and are willing to provide emergency aid, but they have yet to offer the broader health services that are the logical next part of the equation.

Canadians with substance-use disorders are being given a second chance, but one that doesn’t exist on the required scale. And that means the deaths are going to keep coming.

Rita Achrekar is a risk management executive.

Parents, educators and administrators are anxious about school reopening this September. School boards are working hard to prepare for a safe return, yet parents face a difficult dilemma: Should they send their children back and risk them falling sick or infecting others in the family? Or should they keep them at home and risk the children falling behind in their studies and missing out on social interaction with classmates?

Teachers and administrators are understandably worried. How do they deliver quality education without compromising the health of teachers and students? The worries are unlikely to dissipate. Theresa Tam, Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer, recently warned us that the virus could be around until 2022 and we could see a “peaks and valleys” scenario or a “slow burn” scenario.

As a risk management executive who has built and overseen risk frameworks at large, complex organizations, and as a mother of two daughters (now young adults) who attended public school, I believe we are missing a system that measures and communicates risk levels on an ongoing basis to parents, teachers and administrators. We need a system that indicates the level of health risk at any given time and a set of pre-defined actions associated with the signals. This is akin to traffic lights – green means “go,” amber means “slow down,” and red means “stop.”

For it to work, school boards would have to allow enough flexibility in switching between online and in-person classes that schools, teachers and families could respond quickly to changes in the level of risk.

Such a system would help advance the dialogue on how to run schools safely and provide greater comfort to parents and educators alike. No one has a crystal ball to foresee how the virus will play out over the school year, but a pragmatic team of public-health experts, administrators, educators and parents could agree to a set of indicators to assess the level of risk and associated mitigating actions with a goal of always operating schools safely.

An illustrative example would have four levels of risk – very low, low, moderate, and high – along with an early warning indicator (risk is increasing, stable or declining). The risk level would be assessed based on best available scientific measures (key risk indicators) determined by public-health experts and would include factors such as how many cases a community has (absolute number and relative to population), level of testing, 14-day trend, etc.

At very low levels of risk, parents of elementary school students should feel reasonably confident that their child can participate in normal classroom activity, and teachers should feel comfortable being surrounded by students. Of course, preventive protocols such as handwashing, mask wearing, physical distancing, testing and contact tracing should continue as per public-health guidelines.

At low levels of risk, parents, students and teachers should be still comfortable, but a bit more cautious. Administrators could use enhanced safety protocols such as reducing classroom density by moving some students to outdoor spaces, gyms or libraries to ensure proper distance is maintained.

At moderate levels of risk, vulnerable students and teachers or those living with vulnerable family members would switch to online instruction; others would carry on in regular school.

Story continues below advertisement

At a high level of risk, all classes would transition to online instruction. The early warning indicator would signal the direction in which the risk is headed (increasing, stable or declining) and allow everyone time to prepare for a change in the risk level.

The key risk indicators should be calculated and communicated daily on a website. The indicators themselves would have to be updated periodically based on the latest scientific information (e.g. availability of a vaccine or emergence of a new virus strain).

Surveillance and communication of risk levels should be co-ordinated across each province, with regions getting individual risk ratings. After all, Timmins, Ont., might have a different situation than Toronto. The system should be calibrated such that it would be conservative (e.g. better for a healthy student to take class online than a vulnerable one to attend in person).

No system is fool-proof, but we have to learn to live with the virus for a while.

Admit it. Here in B.C., most of us crowed about our ability to flatten the COVID-19 curve under the guidance of our Provincial Health Officer Bonnie Henry, whose measured approach has been to explain the rationale behind steps she wants us to take to keep disease numbers low and ever so gently chide those not following the rules.

We were adults being treated like adults, and for a while the approach worked.

But now COVID-19 cases in British Columbia are on a frightening upswing just as schools are about to reopen, adding another level of risk. We now have the highest number of active cases since the pandemic began. The resurgence has emerged primarily among young adults who have grown weary of physical distancing.

This raises questions about whether B.C.‘s soft approach to pandemic rule enforcement was the right way to go. Would tougher enforcement from the get-go have made people less likely to break the rules?

There is no sure-fire way to run a public-health campaign that will resonate with an entire population, said Steven Taylor, a University of British Columbia psychiatry professor and author of a book called The Psychology of Pandemics: Preparing for the Next Global Outbreak of Infectious Disease. Dr. Henry’s “do the right thing” approach, which appealed to our altruistic natures, worked well when fear of the pandemic was at its peak.

But as the number of deaths fell, it was inevitable the fear would subside, and as with any public-health campaign, message fatigue set in. Prof. Taylor said he believes the gentle approach taken by Dr. Henry and provincial Health Minister Adrian Dix was a calculated decision.

To his ear, the public-health messages sounded as though they were carefully scripted by thoughtful, well-informed people. But given the rising case numbers, “I wouldn’t be surprised if the tone does change,” Prof. Taylor said. On Thursday, Mr. Dix stuck to his good-cop demeanour and encouraged everyone to enjoy the weekend safely.

The tone grew a lot sterner on Friday with an announcement from B.C.‘s enforcer, Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth, who said organizers of large parties or events that defy public-health orders will now be penalized. Mr. Farnworth said event organizers or hosts will be fined $2,000 fines where attendance exceeds the 50-person limit. Owners and hosts of vacation rental properties that allow more than five guests will also be ticketed.

Fines can be issued by a wide range of enforcement personnel, from police and city bylaw officers to liquor inspectors and conservation officers. Vancouver residents are encouraged to call 311 or report concerns using the city’s VanConnect mobile app. Those who promote or attend non-compliant events, break physical distancing rules in bars or restaurants, or fail to leave when asked to do so can now be fined $200, Mr. Farnworth added.

Choosing the right message, especially when trying to get through to young people, isn’t easy, Prof. Taylor said, pointing to Premier John Horgan’s recent appeal to Vancouver-born film stars Ryan Reynolds and Seth Rogan to help persuade young people to stop partying. While celebrities can sometimes help sway young people, the answers that came back from the two actors were so jokey, they likely didn’t convey the seriousness of the situation to their target audience.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Farnworth made it clear he was not joking. He publicly denounced the “selfish people” who are willing to jeopardize public health for the sake of a good time. The threat of a $2,000 fine won’t shut down all the parties. Where there is a will, there’s a way. But telegraphing that B.C. is getting more serious about enforcement may encourage more people to report transgressions and prompt law enforcement officials to write the tickets.

It’s sad it had to come to this. The change in tone indicates just how afraid the government is about our rising COVID-19 case numbers. As we have seen just across the border in Washington State, it doesn’t take long for a slight increase to snowball. Left unchecked, B.C. will be forced, once again, to shut down entire business sectors. And that would be an economic disaster our province simply can’t afford.

Landlord and tenant boards across the country are starting residential eviction hearings again, now that the eviction moratoriums due to COVID-19 have ended in most provinces. It is inevitable that residential evictions are going to rise, having an impact on thousands of households across Canada. A recent Toronto Foundation survey found that between 8 per cent and 13 per cent of tenants in the city were behind on their rent. For Toronto alone, if 10 per cent of renters are in arrears, it means about 53,000 households and 130,000 people are at risk of evictions.

Tensions are running high. Earlier this month, protesters set up a blockade outside a Toronto courthouse to prevent the city’s rental enforcement units from conducting evictions.

There is no silver bullet that will solve all the problems faced by landlords and tenants. Legislation and financial assistance will help, but governments have to be careful to not choose winners and losers resulting from the COVID-19 crisis. Any new legislation needs to balance the needs of tenants, landlords and taxpayers.

Options on the table include extending the residential eviction moratorium, offering rent relief, implementing a freeze on rent increases and bringing in repayment agreement caps, which will reduce the amount a tenant in arrears needs to pay per month.

Most jurisdictions in Canada, the U.S., U.K. and Australia have implemented some type of eviction moratorium for residential tenants. Advocates for renters in Canada and abroad have asked for extensions, with some arguing for permanent bans of evictions relating to rent arrears from COVID-19.

The extension of eviction moratoriums is a problem. Rent arrears are not solved, but merely kicked down the road. Extensions are also unfair to landlords, as they carry the burden of the arrears. Notwithstanding the financial impact on tenants, landlords need rent to cover their own costs, such as mortgages, property taxes and repairs.

If an eviction moratorium is extended, it should be part of a broader strategy to address what happens at the end of the moratorium and how to assist struggling landlords.

In Canada, government rent subsidies to assist tenants have been implemented in B.C., P.E.I., the Northwest Territories and the Yukon. In the U.S., Congress allocated US$100-billion for a rental assistance fund to help low-income renters for up to two years, but this has not come into law yet.

A targeted rent subsidy program to assist low-income renters who have fallen into arrears due to COVID-19 would be beneficial in Ontario. Such a program would have to balance help for those in need with the burden on taxpayers. Assisting low-income tenants now will likely save taxpayers money in the long run, because as evictions rise, so do other costs to taxpayers, including those for social assistance and health care. Plus, the shelter system was already overwhelmed before COVID-19 hit.

Alberta, B.C. and Manitoba each implemented a freeze on rent increases during the pandemic. Ontario did not. The province’s mandated caps on rent increases have generally been in the 2 per cent to 3 per cent range the past few years, so a rent freeze will have a relatively modest impact for most renters compared with the more significant market-driven impact on rent.

The supply of rental properties is expected to rise through more evictions, more voluntary endings of tenancies and fewer short-term rentals (such as Airbnb), which should reduce average rents. In fact, the August 2020 Rentals.ca report shows the average rent across Canada for properties listed on its site is down by 8.1 per cent from the previous year. So, it seems that rent freeze legislation is not a pressing issue.

Landlords and tenants are forced into negotiating rent repayment agreements to address unpaid rent. Moreover, the recently-enacted Bill 184 in Ontario requires the Landlord and Tenant Board to consider whether the tenant was offered a repayment agreement as part of an evictions hearing.

One concern with repayment agreements is the power imbalance between tenants and landlords. In these circumstances, landlords may force tenants to agree to unfair terms.

B.C. created a repayment framework to be implemented later this summer to help landlords and tenants. It requires landlords to give tenants until July, 2021, to repay any outstanding rent, as long as the tenant is regularly paying monthly instalments of rent and outstanding arrears. Similarly, U.S. Senator Kamala Harris (now Joe Biden’s running mate) unveiled a plan that would give tenants up to 18 months to cover missed rent payments.

Providing a framework for repayment agreements would likely assist landlords and tenants in their negotiations. Such guidelines may also help the Landlord and Tenant Board in its adjudications to assess the reasonableness of proposed repayment agreements. The framework should act as a guideline instead of providing rigid criteria that landlords and tenants must follow when entering into repayment agreements.

Retired from the Royal Canadian Navy in 2009 in the rank of commander, he is also a contributor to the security affairs committee for the Royal United Services Institute of Nova Scotia.

When a new piece of military technology is lost, it gets people’s attention, particularly among sailors and aviators. The technology’s novelty and its usually impressive performance tend to lend tremendous confidence to the crews that fly them.

That had been happening with the new Cyclone helicopter built by Sikorsky, a subsidiary company of Lockheed Martin. The long-overdue replacement for the old Sikorsky Sea King was something of an unknown commodity when the notoriously tight-pursed Canadian government selected it. I remember that, as the only naval officer on the board that wrote the purchase’s “statement of requirements,” we were left hoping for an aircraft with at least equal capabilities to the Sea Kings.

But we were delighted by the choice of the H-92, the naval version of Sikorsky’s civil aviation S-92 – a brand-new product that was quickly snapping up contracts, with 300 in service by 2018. Since then, several Cyclones had been deployed on operations at sea with Royal Canadian Navy frigates. The first returned triumphantly to Halifax on board HMCS Ville de Québec, on Jan. 29, 2019, to glowing reviews from crews.

But on April 29, a Cyclone crashed into the Ionian Sea in full view of the crew of its home base, HMCS Fredericton. Six members of the Canadian Armed Forces were killed. The reaction at the scene was described as “horrific” and “a gut-punch.” Having witnessed two helicopter crashes during my time on sea duty, I can personally attest to the pain of witnessing such calamities.

When the fatal crash occurred, critics were quick to condemn the flight control system, citing a problem that occurred in 2017 when a helicopter fell from the sky during flight testing before the flight control system reset itself, enabling the pilot to regain control.

There was growing dread within Canadian military circles that the fly-by-wire control system – an increasingly common system by which computers allow for smooth and efficient translation of human intention into effective mechanical response, and which saves weight and improves aircraft fuel efficiency – was a potential key point for critical failure. The Cyclone and its civil aviation cousin were the first rotary-wing aircraft to use a fly-by-wire system for pilot control of the aircraft, and if that had fundamental flaws, disaster would have undoubtedly ensued.

But the June interim report by the military’s Directorate of Flight Safety determined the crash wasn’t caused by the fly-by-wire control system, but another computer-directed system designed to assist the crew in managing the huge amounts of tactical information being generated by the Cyclone’s new sensors and being received from nearby ships and aircraft.

This flight-management system was intended to keep the aircraft safe from accidents, such as straying outside of assigned patrol areas, or potential shootdown by friendly forces when confusion about identity arises in a pitched scenario; tragically, a low-altitude, high-speed conflict between it and the control system rendered the helicopter uncontrollable.

The critical lesson for military observers is that being the first to use new technology always comes with risks, regardless of the initial reviews. The euphoria over a new level of performance and professional credibility must be tempered with the kind of caution that can only come from long experience and careful appreciation of the past.

This has all happened before, after all: Between November, 1967, and November, 1972, five brand-new Canadian Sea King helicopters were lost, leading to the deaths of five crew members. The causes were pilot error in two cases, and mechanical failure in three.

Five helicopters lost in five years is not a stellar track record for safety by any measure, but it was clear to the military’s senior leadership that the Sea King represented a quantum leap in capability, and corrective measures were put in place to mitigate the risk.

Ten more Sea Kings crashed during the 50-year record of its service, killing two more service members; still, that aircraft was able to log hundreds of thousands of hours on military, humanitarian-assistance and joint-force support missions.

The risk can produce awful tragedy, but this was always understood and accepted by the Canadian Armed Forces and its members, because the gains were eventually seen to broadly outweigh the losses. As Lieutenant-General Al Meinzinger, the commander of the Royal Canadian Air Force, said himself: “There will always be risks in flight operations.”

The Cyclone’s risks will also eventually become normalized. Corrective measures have already been taken, and remedial training for aircrew is well under way. The Cyclone flies over my home on its way to and from the helicopter base at Shearwater in Nova Scotia – and I do not worry about one falling from the sky any time soon.

Re Canadians Risk Becoming Addicted To Aid (Aug. 21): Can I assume that the authors and the groups they represent will be lobbying governments to improve labour standards?

For example, in Ontario, one of Doug Ford’s first actions was to gut recently introduced labour reforms. In particular, he cancelled a planned increase to the minimum wage and eliminated an already meagre two paid days of emergency leave. He continues to oppose paid sick leave for all workers.

These would be great incentives for people to rejoin the work force, and would certainly be constructive “structural reforms” to help us “move forward” post-pandemic.

Jeff Brown Toronto

The authors assert that the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit is too high and acts as a disincentive to work. With respect, I find that the CERB is far too low for a person to live a life of decency.

Yes, a job is better than being on the dole. A job not only provides pay, it provides identity, self-respect and purpose. The problem is that wages for low-paid workers are far too meagre.

Raising wages at the low end of the labour market would not only ensure that people are motivated to get back to work, it would provide them with more ability to stimulate the economy, thus creating even more jobs.

Corporations sitting on massive amounts of retained earnings and paying large executive salaries and bonuses should set an example: Raise the wages of their employees. If many of them could do it at the beginning of the pandemic, they can likely do so on an ongoing basis.

Perhaps this is the time to shift toward a more equitable system. The energy for this feels palpable.

It would be “old thinking” to go back to ideas of unprecedented economic growth to fuel the stock market and shareholder portfolios. New, more equitable ideas involving young people would give them hope for the future, rather than a focus on debt reduction.

Even if debt needs to be considered, it should not be the focus of moving society into the future. A universal basic income is certainly more exciting and energizing. It would create an atmosphere for future generations of wanting to be part of something, through work or other contributions.

A shift in world view feels truly wanted – and possible – at this moment in time.

Political power

Re Who Needs Parliament? Not Trudeau (Editorial, Aug. 20): Government leaders embrace democracy and often promote its virtues to other countries less enlightened. Unfortunately, once in power, that same democracy seems to become an impediment to be ignored or cast aside as it suits them.

Story continues below advertisement

I believe that Justin Trudeau has done so by proroguing parliament, something he said he would never do. Not only does prorogation dispose of investigations into his leadership and halt a Parliament in which Mr. Trudeau holds only a minority, it frees him to spend more tens of billions of dollars. That’s power, but it’s not democracy.

Stephen Harper first did it, and Mr. Trudeau complained. Boris Johnson did the same in Britain and raised a furor. Donald Trump does likewise with presidential executive orders.

Democracy is our chosen form of government. We should have leaders who respect its processes, and not just as a means to power.

David Kister Toronto

The Prime Minister is mostly lauded for his government’s handling of the pandemic. Really? That’s not too difficult when it has simply been a case of opening the gates for more spending.

Bill Morneau deserves credit for pushing back on some Liberal spending initiatives. For example, the $300 program for seniors: Why couldn’t the tax margin have been inserted into these calculations, and high-bracket taxpayers weeded out? My dollars were forwarded to a needy charity.

The ruthless persona of Justin Trudeau is well described in The Globe’s editorial. It should be time for him to go.

Re How Clashes With PM, PMO Led To Morneau’s Resignation (Aug. 20): I understand that some of the friction between Bill Morneau and Justin Trudeau was because the former finance minister attempted to put restraints on the Prime Minister’s free-spending ways. Hopefully, Chrystia Freeland will not be in total agreement with his spending spree.

Mr. Trudeau justifies his spending, saying that government absorbed the costs so that Canadians didn’t have to. I wonder who he thinks is going to pay for Canada’s massive debt.

Oil opinions

Re Alberta Is Losing The Oil Sands PR War (Editorial, Aug. 13): The oil sands produce some of the dirtiest oil on earth. Even if emissions per barrel are reduced – it’s still oil. To have a livable future, we should get off oil: 60 per cent by 2030, 100 per cent by 2050.

Financiers and insurers see this reality, as does Mark Carney when he says that “companies that ignore the climate crisis will go bankrupt.” To think that there is room for oil sands expansion seems a foolish delusion.

Our efforts should be focused on transitioning to renewable energy. This is not a public relations exercise; this is about real change – and a new vision for Alberta’s economic future.

We don’t know it yet, but this is the last time. Like millions of people we will retreat from the world, victims of arbitrary misfortune – the rotten luck of being caught in this moment of plague and economic meltdown. The rotten luck of having not foreseen this calamity, of not having prepared. The rotten luck of living through this crisis in the one place that has most thoroughly failed to withstand it: The United States of America.

In this year of plague and depression, the most powerful nation in human history has become a sad amalgam of laughingstock, cautionary tale and pariah. Roughly 170,000 Americans are dead, in large part due to a near-total abdication of federal leadership, a decades-long evisceration of the social safety net, and a health care and economic system built on a bedrock of racial and class discrimination. More Americans have lost their jobs this year than at any time for which reliable data exist, and in a country where health care is overwhelmingly tied to employment, the layoffs will likely trigger a cascade of foreclosures, evictions and public health aftershocks for years to come. And all of this at the hands of a virus from which almost every other wealthy country on Earth is now in some stage of recovery.

Even by the standards of an administration that has spent the better part of four years alternating between ineptitude and cruelty, it is a truly spectacular failure – a failure so fundamental it will live on as a schism between generations: those who knew life before the pandemic, those who didn’t.

It is impossible to live in the U.S. in this moment and not feel that something of this country is ending. The postwar world in which the U.S. rose to dominance – the world whose defining image of apocalypse, the mushroom cloud, was both instantaneous and subject to individual agency, a finger on the button, an order given and followed – has given way to something else entirely. A new generation’s conception of our undoing is not nearly so brief, not nearly so well-bounded. The existential nightmare now is a slowly building thing, an ever-worsening barrage of climate disasters and unknown diseases and species extinction – crises that cannot be bombed, bought or strong-armed.

One way or another, the U.S. will outlive this pandemic, even if so many of its citizens have not and will not. But the utter hobbling of a superpower, for months on end, at the hands of a disease that almost every other nation managed to subdue through basic leadership and some semblance of societal cohesion is itself the lasting legacy of the coronavirus. It is, in a sense, a blueprint for what this country can expect whenever the next epidemic or natural disaster or recession strikes – whenever the vectors of political and corporate life here, forever oriented away from the communal good and toward the individual good, run into a catastrophe that requires the exact opposite orientation.

This is a diary of the last American year.

On television, the President of the United States is hawking miracle cures – something about blasting the body with light and disinfectant. Later in the day, a parade of public health experts will be forced to appear on the news networks to plead with people not to drink bleach.

Farcical as the whole thing is, it is also a fitting distillation of the Trump era – a spectacle of callousness and cartoonish incompetence that dominates a single news cycle before the next spectacle obliterates it from memory. Ever since November, 2016, this kind of selective amnesia has functioned for many Americans as a kind of psychological self-defence, a means to avoid contending with the overwhelming cumulative damage this man and his administration have done.

Between the beginning and end of April, the number of Americans killed by the coronavirus jumps almost tenfold, from about 7,000 to about 66,000. But it is already becoming clear that these numbers are probably undercounts, both because testing capacity is completely inadequate and because the federal government has made almost no effort to co-ordinate a national response, leaving each state, county and city to cobble together whatever policies and procedures it can. Stories begin to surface of local officials rushing to pay for bulk shipments of protective equipment, briefcases full of cash in hand, before someone from another jurisdiction beats them to it.

Overnight, the surface layer of society seems to crack. In March, the U.S. economy loses 701,000 jobs, the biggest drop since the 2009 recession. In April, it loses 20.5 million – by far the largest drop since the government began collecting job-loss numbers in 1939. Much of the damage is in the service sector, the myriad restaurants, bars and hotels shuttered during this piecemeal lockdown. Then there are the Uber drivers and Airbnb hosts, denizens of the side-hustle economy for whom there are no institutional protections, no pensions or unions or health care plans. With stunning efficiency, a three-part hierarchy forms – minimum-wage workers are forced to stay on the job, because they have no other choice; the middle-class work from home or office according to the policy whims of their employers; and the rich pay to recreate COVID-19-proof versions of their normal lives. The death toll, in turn, begins to skew, and it quickly becomes clear that the virus is killing Black and brown people at a disproportionate rate. In the Navajo nation, where roughly 30 per cent of homes lack running water, there are eventually more COVID-19 deaths per capita than in any U.S state. Overlaid upon the country’s systemic inequities, the pandemic exposes a system not broken, but functioning exactly as originally designed.

But even as the daily caseload remains stubbornly high, by early April a growing number of Republican politicians and CEOs are calling for the economy to reopen. There is stiff resistance to this proposal, from both medical experts and many economists, the latter pointing out that if there’s another surge in cases, the economy will tank regardless. The bleakest estimates predict that, under the worst-case scenario, by the end of the summer there could be as many as 100,000 dead. Asked about these risks in an interview, the Lieutenant Governor of Texas says, “There are more important things than living.”





ESPN airs a years-old tennis match, a dodgeball game and some sort of cornhole tournament. Virtually every ad seems to contain the phrase, “In these difficult times.” The playgrounds are closed, every major gathering cancelled or made virtual. A numbing sameness sets in; we no longer pass through the days, the days pass through us.

Still, there is a glimmer of hope. For most of May, the number of daily cases flattens. Countless Americans have put their lives on hold, risked their mental, emotional and financial well-being, and now there are finally signs that the sacrifice has been worth it. Ironically, this is, in hindsight, perhaps the moment when any chance of containing the virus through societal action became untenable – the case numbers stopped climbing, millions of Americans believed it was all coming to an end, and a massive portion of collective willpower began to melt away. Later, after the country reopened too soon and case numbers surged again, the idea of a second lockdown was simply too much for many to bear.

Over the course of this month, the President again claims the virus will disappear on its own without a vaccine; he claims the United States is the world leader in testing. The most powerful man in the world lies habitually and without consequence – it has simply become the way things are.

Meanwhile, a host of conspiracy theories and fringe internet blocs start to hijack a growing portion of the national conversation around the pandemic, taking advantage of the lack of clear government messaging and a number of contradictory statements about masks and transmission made by scientists still struggling to fully understand the new disease. Online, I watch myriad videos describing how the coronavirus is a hoax intended to distract from secret pedophile sects and Satan-worshipping “deep state” elites, and it would all be funny if it were only a handful of internet trolls that trafficked in this kind of thing. But it’s not. By the end of the summer, a supporter of QAnon – the amorphous group responsible for many of these conspiracy theories – will become the presumptive House nominee in a heavily Republican district of Georgia, all but certain to head to Congress in November. As with the Tea Party and the Birther movement and Donald Trump’s own political ascendancy, what might have been completely unpalatable to mainstream American conservatism a few years ago has found a way into the tent.

Initially buried amid the many scandals and incremental COVID-19 updates, there comes news of a different kind. Toward the end of the month, police officers in Minneapolis kill a Black man named George Floyd. One kills him slowly, choking the life out of him in broad daylight. And for a while, much of this country does not care. When a major cable news network finally runs a story about the killing, the anchor begins by apologizing for not having covered it sooner.

And then there is a reckoning.

At night I drive around downtown Portland and take in what the city has become – the streets silver under police floodlights, storefronts boarded up with plywood, and on one stretch of plywood a vast mural of names and images of dead Black men and women, many of whose killers still walk free.

To watch overwhelmingly peaceful protesters in virtually every major city in the country be met with batons, rubber bullets and tear gas – a weapon banned in wartime – is to watch in total clarity the collision of American myth and American reality. Two entirely different rule sets seem to dictate this country’s institutional tolerance for violence – one universe in which politicians line up to condemn demonstrators for not being sufficiently respectful of the nation’s Apple stores, and another where a sitting Senator is afforded space in the country’s newspaper of record to argue for unleashing the military on American civilians.

More than any protest in recent American history, including the wave of public rage that followed Mr. Trump’s election, the Black Lives Matter movement of 2020 feels like a breaking point. Daily on the news we watch footage of a country at war with itself, albeit an asymmetric one. In Buffalo, police officers shove a 75-year-old man to the ground, leaving him lying in a pool of blood, and when the cops responsible are charged for the assault, a group of their fellow officers show up outside the courthouse to applaud them. In San Jose, Calif., officers shoot rubber bullets at their own implicit bias trainer, who ends up in emergency surgery. In Washington, officers launch tear gas to disperse protesters so the President can pose for a photo op in front of a nearby church, holding a borrowed Bible.

Within weeks, the impact of the movement is visible in almost every corner of American public life. Perhaps most tellingly, hundreds of corporations – from General Mills to the Cartoon Network – take something resembling a stand in support of the anti-racism movement. Many of these corporate statements are plainly empty (if only there was something the NFL could have done earlier to support peaceful protest), but the fact that the core of American capitalism has decided to say anything at all is itself an indicator that many of these companies have decided the public relations fallout of not supporting this movement is worse than continuing to say and do nothing.

In reality, many of the demonstrators’ demands are largely unchanged from what activists in this country have been advocating for the better part of a century. And while dismantling systemic racism isn’t easy or straightforward, getting rid of statues and renaming military bases dedicated to men who fought for the cause of slavery is. Even the demand that has elicited the most controversy – defunding the police – is itself predicated on questions that, in any rational society, shouldn’t be particularly controversial – would at least some portion of the billions of dollars spent on policing not be better spent on housing and health care and resources repeatedly shown to make communities safer? Should a city such as Los Angeles really be dedicating more than half of all its discretionary spending to law enforcement? If a community’s civil toolbox is full of nothing but hammers, how can it not see all its problems as nails?

In a grocery store parking lot near our home, a small group of demonstrators set up a table and a banner. They sit around in the afternoon asking for signatures. They’re trying to recall Oregon’s Governor, Kate Brown, for infringing on their rights. They don’t want to wear masks.

For most of July, the United States sees more than 60,000 new COVID-19 cases every day – a number roughly three times larger than the daily caseload during much of March and April, when the situation was deemed dire enough to warrant widespread lockdowns. But it appears increasingly impossible to institute similar measures now. Mask-wearing has become politicized, just as school shootings became politicized, just as climate change became politicized, just as any instance of communal survival at the expense of personal profit inevitably becomes politicized. When the Democratic mayor of Atlanta tries to institute a mask mandate, the Republican Governor of Georgia sues to stop her. After Republican congressman Louie Gohmert tests positive for COVID-19, he publicly muses that perhaps he might have gotten it from wearing a mask.

It is a strange and disorienting thing to watch this pettiness, not only as the virus kills hundreds of Americans every day, but also as the rest of the world starts to return to something resembling normalcy. In China, the movie theatres are running again; New Zealand goes months between active cases. Europe begins to reopen its borders, though not to travellers from the U.S., which now has a quarter of the world’s cases.

The early panic of spring that gave way to the grief and pleading of summer now gives way to a different kind of anger. It is impossible to watch the rest of the world move on and not imagine an alternate timeline in which the White House supported rather than denigrated its public health agencies, instituted a federal mask mandate, paid workers to stay home and built a program of aggressive testing and tracing. How much human and economic carnage could have been avoided?

In the middle of the month, the Department of Homeland Security dispatches officers to Oregon, supposedly to protect federal property from demonstrators. The imagery from the streets of downtown Portland – of faux-militaristic government troops violently suppressing protesters, of civilians snatched off the street and thrown into unmarked vans – hits a nerve among many Americans, undoubtedly in part because of how active a violation it is. It looks like something dictators do.

But in reality, most of the lasting carnage of this year exists in a kind of negative space – all the victims who died alone and afraid, who never received public mourning; all the weddings and birthday parties and graduation ceremonies cancelled; all the vast and hidden toll of domestic abuse and mental-health crises exacerbated by this half-year and counting of purgatory. There will likely never be a full accounting of all that was lost this year, all that was wasted, only the crushing knowledge that it never had to be this way.





There is some uncertainty as to whether the President of the United States is engaging in an active campaign to rig the coming election. There is some uncertainty as to whether the President wants to serve a third term. There is some uncertainty as to whether the President will leave office if he loses.

A new month brings a new scandal and this time it involves the post office. As the White House ramps up its baseless claim that mail-in voting is rife with fraud, the Postmaster-General – a logistics executive and Trump appointee named Louis DeJoy – begins implementing a sweeping set of cost-cutting measures at the agency. The slashing of overtime and shuttering of mail-sorting machines is seen by many of the President’s critics as a clear attempt to disenfranchise voters ahead of an election that polls show he likely won’t win. The move spurs a wave of outrage. Mr. DeJoy is summoned to appear before the House and Senate; more than a dozen states sue.

Again, part of the outrage is inextricably linked to the sense that this feels so overtly like authoritarianism – an administration crony, at the behest of the Leader, issuing orders to limit the citizenry’s ability to participate in free and fair elections. But it also casts Mr. Trump as a singular destabilizing force in American public life, and like the theory of Russian election meddling, offers the comforting promise that the man is an anomaly, a terrible mistake to be corrected in November and never spoken of again.

But the Trump presidency is neither an anomaly nor an endpoint of some temporary misguided turn. It is impossible to frame the current administration outside a lineage that includes the racist Tea Party and Birther movements, the illegal wars of the Bush era, the rise of Fox News and the general hyper-partisan slide of the American right wing that dates back at least to the Reagan administration. Nor is it possible to ignore the future of this movement, the politicians to whom Mr. Trump’s generation are poised to pass the baton – people such as Stephen Miller, the architect of immigrant child-separation policies; or Senator Tom Cotton, a man who advocated for unleashing the U.S. military on protesters and called slavery a necessary evil. Of all the damage the Trump era has wrought, perhaps the longest-lasting will be the final and probably irreversible transformation of the Republican Party into a place where men such as these represent not some fringe, but the ideological base.

As of this writing, the COVID-19 pandemic has killed more than 170,000 Americans. Likely hundreds of thousands more will die in the coming months as the President pushes for schools to reopen and considers miracle cures suggested to him by a personal friend who makes pillows for a living. Maybe a vaccine will make all of this go away, return everyone to the old normal where Black and brown people might still die at the hands of police and workers might still die on the factory floor, but not of COVID-19; the normal in which the three richest Americans control more wealth than the poorest 160 million. But what of the next calamity? What of the next pandemic, the next drought, the next problem that profit motive alone can’t solve?

One way or another, there’s a different America waiting on the other side of this year – either a country that puts communal survival ahead of individual self-interest, or one that slowly slinks away from relevance as it stumbles from disaster to disaster, its insulated few oblivious to the suffering of the rest.

There is still time to choose.

Harry Swain chaired the Joint Review Panel on Site C and is a former deputy minister of Industry Canada. Mike Harcourt is a former premier of B.C. and former mayor of Vancouver.

Here’s an ineluctable law of nature: Project costs escalate during construction. But still, there are limits around what people should accept. For B.C.‘s Site C dam, the costs have gone from $3.5-billion, which was the estimate when the project was first touted, to the $6.9-billion quoted when the project underwent public review, to the official $10.7-billion price tag that hung until very recently. Since then, BC Hydro has discovered nasty geotechnical conditions under the powerhouse and spillways, and says their cost and schedule estimates are so broken it will take them until the fall just to produce new ones.

The last time costs got away from BC Hydro, the NDP government layered on a Project Assurance Board to keep track. Clearly, its members have not done their jobs, not that their names – nor any reports – have ever been released to the public. On July 31, Bruce Ralston, the province’s Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources and the man in charge of Site C, appointed Peter Milburn, a former deputy minister of finance whose original training was in engineering, to oversee the overseers and to report back in the fall. Under media questioning, however, Mr. Ralston avoided committing to making public any of Mr. Milburn’s reports.

So, what’s the problem? BC Hydro says it discovered some anomalies in January, confirmed them in March after some more drilling – and has been studiously quiet about just what those problems are. It was, of course, a terrible surprise and had nothing to do with the competence of a corporation that hasn’t built a major dam in 40 years.

But was it really a surprise? Back in 2018, a hugely experienced dam engineer named Harvey Elwin said – in a sworn court statement for the West Moberly First Nation – that he’d never seen such appalling foundation conditions nor such secrecy on the part of project proponents. You can bet your boots that every word of his statement was parsed in the corridors of BC Hydro. They knew there were problems years ago. Either they never told the government, or the government did not want to ask, or the Project Assurance Board decided to hope the problem would go away.

BC Hydro blamed all this on COVID-19. But the problem has been staring the utility in the face for years. Its current (and late) reports to the BC Utilities Commission cover 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. Ignoring the novelty of blaming a piece of Pleistocene-era geology for a 21st-century problem, only the final two weeks of the 65 weeks covered by the report overlapped with the COVID-19 lockdown. In 1957, a 15-year-old bridge on the Alaska Highway collapsed a few miles downstream when a landslide in construction-softened clay dislodged the northern cable abutment, so this is nothing new for government.

Going forward, BC Hydro says it will concentrate on getting the diversion tunnels finished so the dam site can be dewatered while it figures out what the new costs will be. River diversion will take place on schedule, but project completion will be delayed by a year at a cost neither calculated nor confessed. They will apparently spend the summer costing out various alternatives for fixing a dam that’s being built on the geological equivalent of billiard balls.

BC Hydro has consumed all of the project’s contingency budget five years before project completion. It will not complete the project for the promised $6.9-, sorry $7.9-, sorry $8.3-, sorry $10.7-billion. At least they have pushed off the date when Site C becomes part of the rate base, to be paid off by all of us taxpayers, until after the next two elections.

But a fundamental problem even nastier than unco-operative geology still looms: the fact that even by 2025, there will be no demand for the power Site C produces. Its cost will likely be north of $120 per megawatt hour (MWh) – even more than the $118/MWh residential consumers paid last year, and more than the very high $87/MWh paid last year for power from Independent Power Producers. Couple that with the concessionary $54/MWh rates promised to the liquefied natural gas industry, and residential consumers are in for a terrific shock. And as the price rises, less will be consumed. This is the elasticity of demand: a snake that eats its own tail.

Eventually, we’ll need the power. But demand has been flat for 12 years, and we have an enormous surplus: around 70 TWh of supply versus 51 TWh of demand, and that doesn’t count the large quantity available as our rolling 10-year right under the Columbia River Treaty at, typically, less than $30/MWh. Even the most optimistic projections of electric vehicle demand or new industrial load will not fill that gap for at least 20 years. Timing is everything when it comes to investments.

In 2017, the NDP government decided, against much evidence, that the B.C. Liberals had succeeded in pushing the project past the point of no return. They now own this project, period. It’s time for a serious, objective, swift, experienced and professional review – not the narrowly circumscribed predetermined review that an embarrassed BC Utilities Commission was obliged to undertake in 2017. It’s still not too late.

No political party in the world has undergone so many identity crises so often as the Republican Party, which on Monday begins its rump convention to renominate Donald Trump as president.

At the turn of the last century, it was forced to decide whether it was a redoubt of conservatism or a vanguard for reform. (Reform won, at least for a while.) At the end of the First World War, it had to decide whether it believed in world engagement or retreat. (Retreat won, until the next world war.)

For the past 80 years, there have been countless wars for the soul of the Republican Party – indeed, it is remarkable how often that very locution has been employed to describe a party otherwise known for steady habits and placid “normalcy,” a word coined by its 1920 nominee, Warren G. Harding.

The war for the soul of the GOP that now is going on – between those aligned with Mr. Trump, and adamantine Never Trumpers including some who have formed a political action committee called the Lincoln Project – has multiple antecedents.

In 1940, when Canada already was engaged in combat in the Second World War but the United States was not, that war for the Republican soul was between isolationists such as New York district attorney Thomas Dewey and interventionists such as the businessman Wendell Willkie. In 1952, it was between conservatives led by senator Robert Taft of Ohio and moderates favouring Dwight Eisenhower, then the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. In 1964, it was between far-right sentinels such as senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona and more liberal figures such as New York State governor Nelson Rockefeller. And almost constantly since 1976, when conservative governor Ronald Reagan challenged incumbent president Gerald Ford for the Republican nomination, it has been over the definition of conservatism in a mature democracy.

“The Republicans are in a perpetual war with themselves,” said Kathleen Iannello, a Gettysburg College political scientist. “They tend to be in a constant argument, and they seldom resolve that argument.”

This era’s war within themselves – this year’s edition of the constant argument – pits classical conservatism against a muscular populism with trace elements of iconoclasm but without ideological grounding. In the air in North Carolina next week, as across the country, is the political question of the age: In the post-Trump era, which will begin either next January or four years later, what will be the character and composition of the American institution known as the Grand Old Party?

Is it the party of international institutions and of NATO, which Mr. Eisenhower led? Or is it the party of global disengagement, as Mr. Trump has undertaken? Is it the party of both the tidy small-town traditions of Main Street and the wealthy wolfishness of Wall Street? Or is it the party of the white non-college workers in mines, factories and construction sites, who were the reliable, sturdy base of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal coalition but who migrated into the GOP after the hard-hat rebellions of 1970 in the Richard Nixon years, the common-sense entreaties of Mr. Reagan, and the full-throated welcome of Mr. Trump? Is it the party of the establishment, or the party of political insurgents? Is it the party of Edmund Burke, the 18th-century philosopher whom many conservatives regard as their ideological North Star? Or is it the party of Edward Lorenz, the MIT professor remembered today as the progenitor of chaos theory?

On the resolution of those questions, the Republican Party – and perhaps American politics as we have known it for the past century – depends.

“The Republican Party doesn’t know what it is right now,” said Natalie Davis, a political scientist at Birmingham-Southern College.

“But it has to decide. Presidential elections are the one time when Americans assess their country, and the Republicans are going to have to take a big-time look inside their party and figure out just who they are – especially if Trump eventually gets trounced and if the Senate flips to the Democrats.”

Right now, Mr. Trump is leading an outlaw party, at conflict with its heritage – but with great adherence from elected GOP officials, if not from the old Republican elite or the Republican mainstream.

“As long as Trump is president, the splits will be less evident than they are in reality,” said Peter Wehner, a senior fellow at the conservative-oriented Washington Ethics and Public Policy Center and a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. There remains a fear and aversion among most Republicans to break ranks from him. But Mr. Trump never reflected the views of mainstream Republicans, who have stayed quiet to protect their political careers.

But, Mr. Wehner said, if Mr. Trump is defeated in November, “there will be a civil war in the Republican Party – extremely intense, and with a lot of acrimony.”

Just 20 years ago, George W. Bush – the blue-chip patrician son of a president and grandson of a senator who was named for his great-grandfather, George Walker, the banker who established golf’s Walker Cup – won the Republican presidential nomination. And in his acceptance speech, he spoke of the GOP as the party “not of repose but of reform.” He discussed “our sense of community” and introduced the term “compassionate conservatism” to a nationwide television audience. He said, in a phrase with more poignancy for our time than for his, “I will not attack a part of this country because I want to lead the whole of it.”

Mr. Bush may not be remembered fondly; he presided over a disastrous war in Iraq and a near meltdown of the economy. But his speech is a good marker for the party’s passage in the 21st century.

“You listen to George W. Bush and he talked about service and character and helping others,” said Stuart Stevens, a top strategist for every GOP nominee between Robert Dole in 1996 and Mitt Romney in 2012, and who is now a leading figure in the Lincoln Project. “That is like language from an ancient, lost civilization. Anyone who talked like that today couldn’t win 20 per cent in a Republican primary. All those qualities, Donald Trump considers weaknesses.”

Now examine Mr. Trump’s acceptance speech 16 years later. “My message is that things have to change,” he said to the audience at his Cleveland convention, “and they have to change right now.” In that one bellowed sentence, Mr. Trump defined himself as a revolutionary – a repudiator of the notion of a Republican president as the nation’s Respectable-in-Chief, as a stable, sober guarantor of social order, for he was clearly determined to reject the ethos of George H.W. Bush, who in a foreign-policy memoirs wrote that “among our most valuable contributions will be to engender predictability and stability.”

In doing so, Mr. Trump catalyzed another GOP departure from the past 30 years: decorum, a mainstay of a Republicanism as antique as a musical cigarette box. For decades, Republicans on Capitol Hill and in presidential elections were described as “courtly” – a characterization that may have seemed discordant for Mr. Nixon but was apt for Mr. Goldwater, Mr. Ford, Mr. Reagan, both Bushes and Mr. Romney, the party’s last nominee before Mr. Trump and now an outspoken Trump dissenter.

That phrase can hardly be applied to Mr. Trump – and indeed, the depletion of the decorum impulse began years before on Capitol Hill, when four decades of minority status in the House boiled over with the ascendancy of the combative representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who introduced a bruising style of Republicanism in Congress. Mr. Trump has taken this to new levels, baldly criticizing and even demeaning his rivals while bitterly attacking his GOP predecessors, especially both Bush presidents.

This coarsening has only made the party fissures, inflamed and dotting the face of U.S. politics, all the more obvious.

They are evident in reliably Republican Oklahoma, which has voted Republican in 16 of the past 17 presidential elections but where unemployment reached nearly 15 per cent in April, and where Mr. Trump held a disastrous, low-attendance rally on June 20. They are burgeoning in swing-state Pennsylvania, where Mr. Trump prevailed four years ago but where he now faces an uphill battle, particularly in Philadelphia’s suburban counties. And they are widening in Massachusetts, which voted Democratic in the past eight presidential elections in a row but which, a century ago, was a sturdy centre of Republicanism, contributing three GOP presidential nominees in the past century, and electing more Republicans than Democrats to the governor’s chair on Beacon Hill since the start of the 20th century.

And on Capitol Hill, where Republican lawmakers have displayed almost iron-clad loyalty to Mr. Trump, there remain important divisions within the party.

For much of this month, Republicans have fought over fiscal legislation, tangling over the composition of the latest coronavirus financial-aid package. They looked askance at Mr. Trump’s executive order for payroll tax cuts, expressing worries the measure would endanger the solvency of the Social Security system. They took sides in a brutal GOP primary in Kansas, with many of them backing the successful establishment contender over the candidate closely identified with Mr. Trump. And they engaged in a range war with a member of one of the Republican Party’s signature families, criticizing Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the party’s highest-ranking woman in Congress, for her apostasy on foreign policy and her support of infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci, whom she called “one of the finest public servants we have ever had.”

But the greatest Republican Party struggle is with its own history.

Story continues below advertisement

Founded as an anti-slavery party in 1854 and electing its first president, Abraham Lincoln, six years later, the Republicans were the original civil-rights party. For generations, the few Blacks offered a ballot voted Republican, the party inevitably described as the “Party of Lincoln.” Indeed, as late as 1964, a larger percentage of Republicans in both the Senate (82 per cent) and the House of Representatives (80 per cent) supported the landmark Civil Rights Act than did the Democrats (69 per cent and 61 per cent, respectively).

Black affinity for the Republicans is one of the explanations for Southern white affinity for the Democrats, who after the end of post-Civil War Reconstruction in 1877 depended for their power on the so-called Solid South, where a one-party system ruled the region, sending Democratic segregationists to Capitol Hill who repeatedly blocked progressive legislation while building up enormous seniority that provided them with powerful committee chairmanships.

The erosion of the Democrats’ vaunted Solid South was gradual, occurring after the so-called Dixiecrats bolted from the Democrats in 1948 because of president Harry Truman’s support for Black rights and a strong civil-rights platform plank. Other than his Arizona home state, all of the states that sided with Mr. Goldwater in the GOP’s 1964 debacle were in the Deep South.

Mr. Nixon’s “Southern Strategy” gave the 1968 nominee Virginia, North Carolina and Florida – and would likely have provided him with five additional Southern states had former governor George Wallace of Alabama not undertaken a third-party candidacy. By 1980, with the ascendancy of Mr. Reagan, a new Solid South – solidly Republican – had taken form. Mr. Trump, who took every state of the Old Confederacy except for Virginia in 2016, is likely to do well in the South again this year, but Texas, North Carolina and Georgia may be within the Democrats’ grasp; Florida, where Democratic nominee Joe Biden has opened up a double-digit advantage over the President, could abandon Mr. Trump.

Still, it remains possible that even after Mr. Trump’s presidency, Republicans could retain his style and political portfolio.

“A large part of the Republican establishment and the very different conservative establishment are eager to return to regularly scheduled programming and to write Trump off as an anomaly and believe there are no lessons to be learned from him,’' said David Azerrad, a Montreal-reared conservative theorist who now teaches at the Washington campus of Hillsdale College. “Republicans can’t win electorally on Reagan lobotomized and cryogenically frozen, which is the view of a large part of the donor class and the Republican consulting class.”

Yet as the United States becomes more diverse – it is projected to be a “majority minority” country in a quarter-century’s time – the demographics of the Republican Party are, in the characterization of Harvard Kennedy School political scientist Thomas Patterson, “horrible.” “The two groups the Republicans depend on – evangelicals and working-class whites – are in decline,” he said. “Republican groups are shrinking and Democratic groups are growing.”

Prof. Patterson, projecting the political future by working with Census Bureau estimates, says that based on population change alone, the Democrats would have a 59-41 percentage point advantage in only a dozen years. The presence of Senator Kamala Harris of California, the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, on the Democratic ticket, only reinforces the demographic differences between the parties – and the long-term challenge the GOP faces.

But for the short term, Republicans are focused on the 2020 election and the stark choice that partisans of both sides identify.

“It doesn’t do very well to say that Trump is not perfect and is no better than these liberal nuts who are trying to destroy the country,” said Victor Davis Hanson, a prominent conservative thinker at Stanford’s Hoover Institution. “It’s not hard to see the bright side of Trump. Everybody was getting a job. The border traffic was closed. Everybody was happy. But the elites in the Republican Party didn’t get it. I don’t think they get it now.”

Thus, even as the Republicans seek to unite themselves next week, their divisions are writ large.

“This is not a united party,” said Mr. Wehner, the veteran of three Republican administrations. “It is not a coherent party, and it is not a happy party.” Luckily for them, the festivities in North Carolina will be restricted because of the coronavirus threat. There’s too much unease within the party to party.

Liberal literature

Re Morneau’s Office, Kielburgers Described As ‘Besties’ In Newly Released Documents (Aug. 20): Ferreting out dishonesty in the government’s 5,000 pages on the cancelled volunteer program will demand an uncharacteristically assiduous team of well-diggers. Like the philosopher Diogenes, who went amongst the people holding a lantern, seeking an honest man at noon hour, the opposition is in dire need of a dishonest government to expose.

It is true that the process which earmarked millions of dollars for WE Charity was hurried, and short on identifying other worthy organizations to administer the funds. On the other hand, no one has been shamed, because no self-interested functionary has laid hands on public funds.

Re Who Needs Parliament? Not Trudeau (Editorial, Aug. 20): Reading Chrystia Freeland’s 2012 book Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else was like being a voyeur, gleaning tidbits on the rich and famous and the glories of capitalism.

Ms. Freeland provides numerous insights into how and why the global elite identify only with themselves. She also highlights how Ivy League graduates are flocking to jobs in finance because it’s easier to rearrange other people’s money than create their own.

Every time Justin Trudeau and his Liberals open their mouths, I’m reminded of the disconnect between those with silver spoons and those of us who are polishing the silverware.

Re Class Sizes Capped In Areas Hit Hard By COVID-19 (Aug. 21): I am a teacher who is extremely nervous about going back to school.

I am slated to be in a portable with 26 students in a split class of grades 4 and 5. It will be impossible to put 26 desks at two metres apart. My board’s policy says that portable doors are to remain locked at all times, and COVID-19 protocol is for fans to remain off to prevent possible spread.

Imagine what it is going to be like wearing a face mask for 300 minutes a day in these conditions. I cannot. If the Ontario government still feels it is unsafe for all MPPs to return to Queen’s Park, how can it be safe for 26 children and one teacher to be confined in such a small space?

We are not asking for more money for ourselves. We need it so that a return to school is as safe as possible for everyone.

Re Trump Is Targeting A Cherished Piece Of American History (Aug. 19): The efforts of the Trump administration to disable mail-in voting includes blocking the rights of U.S. citizens in Canada. To vote in U.S. elections, we must register in our previous voting district and mail in our ballots.

I am not surprised by this move – Donald Trump seems to have never shown any care for Americans outside his core electoral college states.

Dream on

Re Never Be The Same Again (Opinion, Aug. 15): In my experience, the past is always irrecoverable; COVID-19 has made that reality global. Like the Trump presidency, it has enabled an unsought mass civics class in how our economies and societies work.

Those who are “just about making it,” as Theresa May boldly identified them, were numerous before COVID-19, are more numerous now and will quite likely be more numerous again as things unfold. This should be an indictment of what we are as a society.

Conditions for most Canadians have visibly and statistically deteriorated over my lifetime. In the 1960s, when Canada rejoiced in a short-lived primacy after the Second World War, it was possible for my generation to imagine (with John Lennon) a better world, one with growing and spreading prosperity and dignity. But San Francisco was not about social justice, then or now.

As governments continue to drive spiralling collective spending to support collective survival, we could usefully consider and act on our responsibilities to fellow citizens.

Contributor Lori Fox dreams of an idyllic life sustained by her writing. She suggests that it is capitalism that keeps the dream out of reach.

A world where each of us contributes by participation in our favourite activity would be wonderful. However, most of the work that needs to be done is not anyone's first choice for a career. That is a fact that resource redistribution cannot change.

We don’t dream about what we have. We dream about what is out of reach. When we fail to attain it, we might look to the system or to ourselves for an explanation. Both may provide answers, but looking at ourselves is less comfortable.

The truth is that most of us lack the talent to be paid to do what we love most. The appeal of such professions makes them so competitive that many talented people can’t make the cut.

Shortcomings and dreams are hallmarks of the human experience. They are not unique to an economic system. Neither is the importance of finding contentment in the compromises we live.

Time is a flat circle

Re Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is? (Opinion, Aug. 15): During the pandemic, space and time have compressed as we remain at home, with only the internet connecting us to the outside world.

Decades ago, before the internet, our experiences of time were influenced by the schedules and geographic boundaries of our workplaces and homes, or by travel and recreation. Laptops and smartphones erased such boundaries, creating a world of anytime, anywhere. That has efficiencies, but comes at the loss of geographic distinctiveness and temporal independence.

When we make ourselves available anytime, anywhere, we no longer control time – it controls us.

After a difficult five months, it finally feels like the worst is over. That the novel coronavirus pandemic is receding. That maybe we can get back to some semblance of normal and be done with the worst aspects of the lockdown.

The virus that causes COVID-19, however, is not done with us. British Columbia and Manitoba – two provinces that had been successful in the virus fight – have recently reported their highest tally of daily new cases since the pandemic began. This is a long way from over.

The first wave of the virus forced a lot of sacrifices on Canadians. Our collective effort kept the pandemic contained at reasonable levels. Now, as the country carefully reopens – with many still jobless and the unemployment rate at a stark 10.9 per cent – personal vigilance is as important as ever.

On Aug. 7, Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, issued a warning. She outlined a “reasonable worst-case scenario” that could see a surge of cases this fall much greater than the peak in late April. Such a scenario could overwhelm the health care system.

The goal, instead, is a “slow burn,” where the virus is contained at the current low levels, and life can continue semi-normally. Canadians are the first line of defence in this effort, Dr. Tam said. Our commitment and personal comportment are the key factors in keeping the pandemic in control.

“What we do now will influence the probability for that fall peak,” she said.

That means physical distancing, washing our hands often and keeping our bubble of close contacts small. It means wearing a mask when distancing isn’t possible, staying home if you have symptoms and avoiding high-risk settings – namely, crowded indoor spaces.

That’s where the virus can run free. Private parties and bars, for example, have sparked clusters of cases in B.C. The province has shut down several bars and, after a longstanding go-soft-and-persuade approach, is looking at the policing of private parties at which public-health rules are ignored.

Asymptomatic transmission among people under 40 is an issue. But while young people and bars have gotten a lot of attention, it’s important to note that, nationally, most outbreaks of COVID-19 are still happening in long-term care homes and seniors’ residences – where the disease is at its deadliest.

The critical goal this fall in every region will be to have fewer than one new daily case per 100,000 people, a level that indicates low community transmission. This is essential for the safe reopening of schools.

Some of the latest data are worrisome. From Aug. 13 to 19, B.C. stood at 1.6 daily new cases per 100,000. Edmonton hit 5.8 from Aug. 10 to 16. At the worst of the pandemic in Ontario, in April, the number there was 3.9. The United States hasn’t been below 14 since late June.

There is good news. On a national basis, the new-case rate in August has been steady at about one per 100,000. Ontario has corralled the virus, and the rate of new infection there is now 0.7 per 100,000.

This coronavirus is persistent, and setbacks such as the one in B.C. are not a surprise. Looking around the world, countries that were among the most successful against the virus in March, April and May – places including South Korea and Australia – are battling new spikes. Australia has put Melbourne on a partial six-week lockdown that includes a curfew between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m.

When the pandemic hit in March, Canadians answered the call to duty. Not much is often asked of us as citizens, but Canadians have shown we are at our best when the common good calls for it.

A recent Angus Reid survey suggests that about half of Canadians remain fully vigilant. Another third are inconsistent in their caution, but mostly abide by key measures such as physical distancing and hand washing, even if they don’t always wear masks. But one-fifth of Canadians are “cynical spreaders” – people who are less concerned about the pandemic and take few precautions.

When Dr. Tam outlined the two possible scenarios for this fall – a huge wave, or a slow burn – she said the latter could last into 2022.

That’s a ways off. There are big hopes for a vaccine. But this virus will be with us well into next year. It is our individual actions that, taken together, will keep COVID-19 at bay.

Jessica Leonora Whitehead is an arts and sciences postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto. Her research has appeared in such publications as the Canadian Journal of Film Studies and Mapping Movie Magazines, and she is currently working on a book project exploring Italian-Canadian cinema cultures.

The dawning realization of vast tragedy is, unfortunately, a common feature of pandemic history.

When the second wave of the Spanish flu pandemic hit Canada in the fall of 1918 – killing even more Canadians than the first – governments that had time to implement better processes were slow to act. In part, that was because Ontario’s provincial health officer J.W. McCullough insisted that closing schools, movie theatres and churches wasn’t necessary, even in early October. But Harold Fisher, the mayor of Ottawa, shut down his city on Oct. 5, adding that Mr. McCullough would eventually “wake up” to reality. Mr. Fisher was right: When more than 200 people died in Toronto in the two weeks after Ottawa’s lockdown, the province finally banned all public gatherings. The parts of Canada that hadn’t already locked down quickly followed. The risks around movie theatres were part of that era’s dawning realization, too: It only became clear to officials that theatres were vectors of infection at the time of that second wave.

Today, amid the third phase of reopening after COVID-19 lockdown, movie theatres are trying to get back to a kind of normalcy. On Friday, Cineplex Inc. became the first major theatre chain in the world to return all of its cinemas and screens to service, having implemented preselected “physically distanced” seating, mask requirements and new cleaning procedures. But with a still-murky future for the film and theatre industry – which had already been enduring long-standing revenue decline – there are lessons in how the same sectors endured the Spanish flu more than a century ago.

At first, exhibitors – many of whom were consulted directly – were happy to comply with 1918′s public-gathering order. Although Thomas Scott, the secretary of the Motion Picture Exhibitors Protective Association of Ontario at the time, seemed to resent that stores were not facing the same bans – calling for governments to impose a “partial closing” on them – he said the industry would do its part to protect the public.

While the bans led to financial hardships – in Winnipeg, theatres asked the city for $23,000 (more than $330,000 in today’s dollars) so they could pay their employees – exhibitors remained optimistic. Many used the time off to renovate, confident that they could easily recoup their losses when entertainment-starved soldiers coming home from the war – along with countless weekly moviegoers – were allowed to return to the cinema.

Eventually, however, some exhibitors decided to fight flu bans – some because they were losing too much money, others because they felt unfairly targeted, echoing Mr. Scott’s grievances. A common claim deployed by desperate owners was that the air in theatres was “better than the street” due to their ventilation systems; some even suggested that epidemic fears were overblown and health officials were overreacting.

Film production, in the meantime, was also affected. Nearly every Hollywood studio ceased production for five weeks, and many of the leading ones laid off their employees without pay. Film stars were infected by the disease; Harold Lockwood was one of the first stars to die of the Spanish flu, and Canada’s own Mary Pickford, the Toronto-born actor known as “America’s Sweetheart,” contracted the flu in 1919, but eventually recovered.

Masks were a hotly debated issue then, too. In October of 1918, the province of Alberta enacted a by-law that masks must be worn anywhere outside of individual homes, including in reopened theatres; advertisements for masks appeared in newspapers across the country as Canadians snapped them up. But some editorials made it seem that masks were dangerous, citing the hospitalization of a California woman who had a “break from sanity” after witnessing masked crowds. Hundreds of Albertans went on to flout the mask by-law.

Before the flu vaccine finally became commonplace, large influenza outbreaks continued to wreak havoc on North American communities after the 1918 second wave. Theatres in some North American communities were closed well into the 1920s because of rolling influenza outbreaks, curdling that initial goodwill. In the winter of 1920, for instance, exhibitors in the city of Topeka, Ka., refused to comply with another flu ban, prompting the dispatch of police to block theatre entrances.

Many of these elements are simmering during today’s COVID-19 crisis. While most Canadian exhibitors only endured lockdowns of between four and seven weeks in 1918, our current pandemic shuttered theatres for months. On the production side, the continued closing of the U.S.-Canada border means American actors and crew cannot yet work here, while lower-budget independent films face potentially fatal financial obstacles with insurance liabilities. A second COVID-19 wave or any further delays – including to the development of a vaccine – will only increase financial pressures on companies, and 1918 showed us that this can inspire more belligerence in time. And slow-and-steady, rightly, remains the plan: “Nothing significant will be shooting until after Labour Day,” Pinewood Toronto Studios chairman Paul Bronfman told the Hollywood Reporter. “Things will take time to get used to, production will take more time on set, and it will cost producers more money.”

There remains a sense of optimism among Canadian film producers, with Mr. Bronfman adding that “there’s a feeling that when the recovery happens, our production community is in the best position of anybody in the world to handle television and film.” But for Canadian exhibitors, 1918′s postban hope isn’t there. When the flu bans were lifted, the trade papers reported that film fans were “show-hungry,” with moviegoers returning in droves; today, thanks to the quality of TV programming and the rise of streaming services, the industry cannot assume that customers will simply come back. Staggered showtimes and reduced theatre capacities by as much as 80 per cent do not add up to long-term financial success, either.

After the Spanish Flu closings, the movie business grew to new heights with the vertical integration of the industry, which some film historians have suggested was facilitated by the post-1918 closing of many small mom-and-pop theatres. It remains to be seen if the current industry can also adapt – before we come to the dawning realization that it’s too late.

Jeff Rubin is the former chief economist and chief strategist at CIBC World Markets. His latest book is The Expendables: How the Middle Class Got Screwed by Globalization, from which this essay has been adapted.

You could see the pandemic coming. It wasn’t as though there was no warning. The virus emerged in China but arrived in North America before we were ready, and it landed with the destructive force of a tsunami. Record-setting consumer spending hit a brick wall as shoppers stayed home. New car sales went over a cliff. And following just like clockwork, unemployment went through the roof as shops and factories shut down. An unprecedented bull run on the stock market quickly turned into panic selling, and the Dow cratered, seemingly overnight. The S&P dropped over 20 per cent into bear market territory, and the result was a global recession that seemed to come out of nowhere. More than 116,000 people died in the United States.

Elvis Presley appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show that year, the Frisbee was invented, Ford introduced the Edsel with great fanfare, Canada unveiled the Avro Arrow jet fighter, the USSR launched Sputnik, and Dwight Eisenhower was sworn in as president of the United States. It was 1957.

By the way, the world recovered almost immediately from the Asian flu, as that pandemic was known. After a staggering 10-per-cent decline in gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter of 1958, by the third quarter growth had spiked to 10 per cent – a 20-percentage-point swing. So, no big deal, right? The economy got the flu, it took some time off, and it went right back to churning out jobs and profits. In fact, when economists and historians talk about the “Eisenhower Recession,” they seldom even mention the Asian flu as a cause.

It would seem to follow, then, that we have a model to help us predict what the recovery from COVID-19 will look like. Just look at 1958, and then wait for the jobs and the markets to return to form and the good times to resume – not quite the catastrophe we feared.

But while consumer spending, consistent GDP growth and a record-breaking bull run on the stock market may make it feel as though we’ve wandered into the past, that is a dangerous illusion, especially if you’re a member of the rapidly shrinking middle class. Because consumer spending, GDP growth and stocks have almost nothing to do with your economic health.

In fact, those things measure only rich people’s economic health. And of late, these folk haven’t been getting rich by making more Edsels or engineering more Arrows. Those cars and planes belong to a different world, a world in which factory jobs paid a middle-class wage and products on the shelves came from factories down the road. A world in which local labour was so essential that their jobs were secure. And a world where taxes were so progressive that the rich actually paid their freight. That was a long time ago.

Looking backward in politics is usually considered poor form. It’s much safer to be considered progressive and look ahead. But the fact is that the late 1950s and early 1960s may have marked the greatest economic equality in history. And that economic health was like immunological health. The economy got better quickly because it was already healthy.

But two other things happened in 1957 that give us some sense of why the recovery from the COVID-19 recession might be a lot harder than shaking off the Asian flu.

First, the Treaty of Rome was signed in March of that year, establishing the precursor of the European Union (the European Economic Community). Though the tight political and economic integration of a “United States of Europe” was still just a dream, the Treaty of Rome was an important step in creating a common market. Up until that point, each country had the ability to impose tariffs to protect key industries and the associated jobs. From that moment on, France, West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg would give up that ability in exchange for the right to sell in each other’s markets without facing tariffs. The hope behind lifting tariffs was that in a world of economic expansion, workers and industries wouldn’t need protection: There would be so much wealth to go around that everyone would be better off.

In other words, it was a form of free trade and a precursor of what was to follow. Free trade was an idea that was sweeping the world. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a treaty designed to increase international trade by removing protections for industry and labour, had been signed into law in 1947, and went through several rounds of updates, each slashing more tariffs. In 1956, the so-called Geneva Round (because it was negotiated in Geneva) eliminated US$2.5-billion of protections between 26 countries. So, globalization was swirling in the air as the Asian flu was making its way across the Pacific.

The Asian flu could have cratered the global economy, but it didn’t. By coincidence, there was another near miss that year that most people didn’t even notice at the time. In 1986, it was revealed that a U.S. Air Force B-36 bomber had accidentally dropped a hydrogen bomb on New Mexico in May, 1957. It was, it turned out, the most powerful nuclear bomb ever built. At ten megatons, it was bigger than anything in today’s nuclear arsenal, and about 625 times more powerful than the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. Though the 42,000-pound bomb did not detonate, it left a crater 3½ metres deep and more than seven metres wide. If it had gone off, it would have vaporized the air base where the bomber was scheduled to land.

An investigation revealed that a safety mechanism had been removed.

You would think the Air Force would have been a little more careful with warheads by 1957. They’d already jettisoned one bomb off the coast of British Columbia, and another in the St. Lawrence River, in addition to crashes of nuclear bombers in the Atlantic and in the mountains of New Mexico. Another two nuclear bombs fell out of the sky in 1961 over North Carolina. Removing protections when so much is at stake, even to increase efficiency, can be more than dangerous. It can be apocalyptic.

None of those bombs detonated, but the slow-fuse-burn of GATT and globalization has left an industrial landscape every bit as cratered as the destruction left by a nuclear warhead. If a worker from 1957 could see Detroit today, what would he think? The shuttered factories across North America, the boarded-up main streets, the empty union halls – the physical toll of globalization would be inescapable.

Which brings us back to the flu.

Early on in the COVID-19 crisis, the scale of the required government response was often compared to that needed during the Second World War. It was time for our ingenuity and industrial might to be put to good use and mobilized, much in the way it had been a couple of generations ago. The United States built more than 2,700 Liberty-class freighters between 1941 and 1945. That’s two 14,000-tonne ships every three days (or more than 39 million tonnes of ship). Surely, the world’s biggest economy could make some N95 masks.

Well, not really. On March 19, 2020, Taiwan announced it could spare 100,000 masks a week for the United States (their sole military ally, which has been protecting them from Communist China for generations at immense cost). That’s out of a weekly output of seven million masks. So the Taiwanese were willing to set aside 1.4 per cent of their mask capacity for their much larger ally.

The EU also adopted a policy of “every man for himself.” In March, Brussels banned the export of medical equipment, even to other European countries, before eventually relenting in the face of pleas from member countries such as Italy that were hit particularly hard by the pandemic. Exasperated Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic stood in front of television cameras and said: “European solidarity doesn’t exist. That was a fairy tale on paper.” Shortly thereafter, Serbia shut its borders. The only foreigners allowed to enter the country? Chinese doctors. Mr. Vucic called China “the only ones who can help.”

He did have a point (though Russia also sent several transport planes full of equipment and medical personnel). Before the crisis broke, half of the world’s masks were made in China. Since then, the country has increased production twelve-fold. By the end of March, factories in China were pumping out 115 million a day.

While the Chinese government is busy controlling the world supply of crucial commodities, Canadian diplomats are reduced to sending out messages on social media, hoping that Chinese alumni of Canadian universities will be willing to help find a few boxes of gloves and masks. Hardly the commanding heights of the global economy that globalism promised.

What the COVID-19 crisis has shown us is that questions of economic theory aren’t just about economic health. They’re about health. Period. Because it’s not just masks and protective gowns the Chinese government effectively control. For years, lax regulatory control and low wages have made China a major source for the majority of component chemicals that go into generic drugs – that is, nearly all of the drugs Canadians and Americans are prescribed.

In a world frequently described as “globalized,” that’s not supposed to matter. The magic of just-in-time delivery, combined with efficient labour markets and economies of scale, is supposed to provide us with whatever we need, in abundance and at the best prices. That may work for flip-flops and lawn furniture (or whatever globally sourced product you buy at Walmart), but, as it turns out, it doesn’t work in an emergency. It doesn’t work when you absolutely need it to work.

It shouldn’t have taken a pandemic to teach us this lesson. The evidence has been piling up around us for years. But tragedy has a way of focusing one’s attention. Global deregulation was always a bad idea. It was always set up to benefit a small number of people at immense cost to everyone else. Exactly what that cost is becomes clear when we compare today’s economy with 1957′s.

“We don’t want a dealer on every corner,” the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users’ Hugh Lampkin told me recently.","Travis Lupick is the author of Fighting for Space: How a Group of Drug Users Transformed One City’s Struggle with Addiction.

The debate around decriminalizing all drugs, including heroin and cocaine, has moved decidedly into Canada’s mainstream. In July, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police (CACP) called on Ottawa to drop criminal penalties for the possession of small amounts of drugs. Meanwhile, many public-health agencies have arrived at the same conclusion; through 2019, top health officials for the country’s three largest cities – Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver – all stated publicly that they, too, favour ending arrests for minor drug crimes.

Then, on Aug. 20, The Globe and Mail reported that the independent Public Prosecution Service of Canada (PPSC) has directed members to henceforth refrain from pursuing charges for drug possession in all but the most serious of cases. This could mean de facto decriminalization.

These moves were largely in response to an overdose epidemic that has only intensified since COVID-19 arrived. Overdose deaths have soared over and above anything the fentanyl crisis had brought before. Toronto Public Health just revealed that, with 27 suspected overdose deaths, July was the city’s deadliest month on record. Authorities are growing desperate and turning to ideas they previously might have considered too controversial.

Despite the growing chorus of experts and stakeholders calling for decriminalization, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeatedly stated that the Liberals would not do so. But that chorus is missing one important voice: Canada’s drug users. Many want decriminalization, but they will also have tough questions for any potential move – and their warnings might surprise people.

For drug users, the potential pitfalls of decriminalization are frightening and all too likely to happen. One fear they have about decriminalization is that authorities will drop criminal punishments, only to raise an oppressive regime of civil penalties – specifically, issuing tickets and fines. Maya Schenwar and Victoria Law’s new book, Prison By Any Other Name, uses U.S. drug courts in the United States as an example of how this can backfire. In the U.S., it is increasingly common for someone caught with drugs to be diverted from the criminal system and instead directed through a drug court into treatment. While this sounds like a victory for health care over incarceration, the book’s authors show that drug courts’ lower threshold for apprehension actually “widens the net,” resulting in a larger overall number of people facing oppressive interactions with the state. “And then when people violate the terms of their drug-court sentence,” Ms. Schenwar told me recently, “often the penalty is incarceration, and often it is the maximum sentence.”

It’s easy to imagine the same thing happening with decriminalization, where someone caught with a crack pipe might receive a $300 ticket instead of a prison sentence, but then fail to pay that fine and find themselves imprisoned for that offence. And because police officers will likely hand out more of these tickets than they currently make actual arrests for possession, the result could be a larger number of people interacting with Canadian police, cycling through the courts and ending up in prison.

This is drug users’ greatest fear around decriminalization: that it will not result in less police harassment, but in fact mark the beginning of a new phase of the war on drugs, involving a different kind of violence.

A second fear is that decriminalization will be seen as the finish line, when it should in fact be where reforms only begin. As much as people who use drugs are fighting for decriminalization, it’s not the ideal solution. Decriminalization only concerns the demand side of the illicit drug market; it leaves supply in the hands of organized crime. The deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl will continue to kill users. Activists ask for decriminalization because they consider it a goal that is within reach, but what they actually want is full legalization and regulation – something akin to what the Trudeau government did with cannabis in 2015 (though the distribution of hard drugs would likely be somewhat medicalized). Users want to know what they put into their bodies. And a fear is that if Canada does decriminalize drugs, that’s where the experiment will end – far short of bringing in the regulations users argue would truly allow autonomy over their bodies.

People who use drugs want decriminalization, and they want it without delay – but not as a free-for-all. “We don’t want a dealer on every corner,” the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users’ Hugh Lampkin told me recently. “All we really want is the police to leave us alone.” Indeed, decriminalization should be an orderly end to police harassment, without new penalties replacing old – and only the first step on the road to legalization and regulation.

Peter Donolo is the vice-chair of Hill + Knowlton Strategies Canada. He served as director of communications to prime minister Jean Chrétien.

It’s been the fevered nightmare of Canadian progressives for the past four years: That any day now, the pathogens of Trumpism – with all its hatred and rage – will jump the border and infect the Canadian body politic.

In fact, U.S. President Donald Trump’s very name has become a despised epithet hurled at populist politicians on the right. During the 2018 Ontario election, Naomi Klein labelled now-premier Doug Ford “our very own Donald Trump”; Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has routinely been called Trumpian, and ditto to Quebec Premier François Legault.

Story continues below advertisement

But the comparisons ring hollow. Neither Mr. Ford nor Mr. Kenney could be accused of playing the bald white-power politics that is at the core of Trumpism. The annual Ford Fest held in Etobicoke hosts an enthusiastic crowd as diverse as any political gathering anywhere in Canada on the left or right, while Mr. Kenney, a senior cabinet minister in Stephen Harper’s government, was a singularly effective ambassador to Canada’s ethno-cultural communities.

In fact, both premiers represent conservative strains that are as Canadian as maple syrup. In Mr. Ford’s case, it’s a message loop of chamber-of-commerce bromides that hark back to the Mike Harris years. For his part, Mr. Kenney, with his strident axe-grinding, feels like a throwback to regional strongmen such as B.C.‘s W. A. C. Bennett, Saskatchewan’s Ross Thatcher and Newfoundland’s Brian Peckford.

And while Mr. Legault evinces an outright hostility to diversity that might strike some as Trumpian – particularly in the profoundly illiberal (though avowedly pro-secular) Bill 21, which bans the wearing of religious symbols by Quebec public sector employees – this too has a long and particular pedigree in the politics of the province, from Maurice Duplessis’s persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses to Jacques Parizeau railing against “money and ethnic votes” on the night of the 1995 referendum. And on a wide range of issues, including climate change, the Legault government is the antithesis of Trumpist.

Indeed, the only two prominent Canadian politicians to openly embrace Trump-style populism and xenophobia – 2017 Conservative leadership candidate Kellie Leitch and People’s Party founder Maxime Bernier – crashed and burned spectacularly, destroying the political careers they had spent years building.

So what is it about Canadian soil that makes it inhospitable to Trump-style politics? The pollster Michael Adams wrote a whole book on the subject, Could It Happen Here? Canada in the Age of Trump and Brexit, and found that the answer to his question was no. He and others point to Canada’s long history of compromise and accommodation (even if it’s often most accommodating to the elites) – and whatever it lacks in glamour or drama, it makes up for in effectiveness. Our broad national consensus over public health care is often cited, as is our openness to immigration. Indeed, Mr. Adams sees the latter as the fuel for continuing demographic renewal that has quite plausibly become “not only our defining feature, but also the engine that injects values of openness, tolerance and compromise into every sphere of social life.”

These and similar explanations make sense, as far as they go. They are, however, also a little too redolent of Canadian smugness – a characteristic often at play when we compare ourselves to the United States. And they miss what is likely the most important explanation of all: money and economies of scale.

Put simply, Canada won’t produce a Donald Trump for the same reason we don’t have a domestic automobile industry: our market isn’t big or lucrative enough.

Open this photo in gallery Political historians can trace some of Trumpism's roots to the conservatism or populism of politicians like Joseph McCarthy and Barry Goldwater (first row) or George Wallace and Huey Long (second row). To win and hold the presidency, Mr. Trump has borrowed from the playbooks of Republican predecessors like Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan (third row). The Associated Press, The New York Times

By one measure, Mr. Trump is the latest manifestation of a strain of American politics dubbed “The Paranoid Style” by the historian Richard Hofstadter more than half a century ago. In this sense, the U.S. President’s lineage can be traced through populists such as Louisiana’s strongman 1930s governor, Huey Long, through Red-baiting senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s, to segregationist governor and presidential candidate George Wallace in the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, Mr. Trump’s most recent re-election gambit – representing the forces of “law and order” against urban protesters – directly swipes from Richard Nixon’s successful 1968 playbook.

But in a more fundamental way, Trumpism owes more to P.T. Barnum and Arthur Nielsen than to Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater. In fact, his election was more or less the culmination of a 30-year process in which right-wing politics was transformed into a huge and vastly profitable business.

The seeds were planted in 1987, when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the U.S. broadcast regulator, eliminated its so-called “fairness doctrine,” which required broadcasters to present contrasting views in any airtime discussions of controversial public issues. That decision opened the way to the first generation of right-wing talk radio – and stars such as Rush Limbaugh – and television, particularly Fox News. Over the past 20 years, the internet, never subject to FCC-style content-regulation, carried on what radio and television started, catering to a vast audience – and, equally important, a vast advertising base – that revels in angry, often apocalyptic, wall-to-wall political indoctrination, packaged as news and performing as entertainment.

As the historian Rick Perlstein explained in an influential 2012 essay, The Long Con, this massive politico-entertainment complex has more to do with money than it does to politics. And the profit machine works on the most reliable, time-tested technique of all in mass media: attracting eyeballs and selling advertising, ideally in huge volumes.

Consider that, according to Forbes, marquee Fox News host Sean Hannity earned US$36-million in 2018. Consider too that Alex Jones, the online conspiracy maven who has posited, among other claims, that the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school massacre was a government-planned hoax, rakes in at least US$10-million a year selling ads on his website for survivalist gear and dietary supplements. Even in the face of relentless public pressure, Amazon has decided to continue advertising on the alt-right Breitbart news site. And this summer, an investigation by the Alethea Group showed that right-wing websites “monetize the anger stoked by misleading political content” by collecting the e-mail addresses of their readers and selling them to commercial brands.

The symbiotic relationship between hucksterism and right-wing politics is vividly illustrated by the case of former Navy Seal Edward Gallagher. Fresh from being pardoned by Mr. Trump last year, after a trial for war crimes committed in Iraq, Mr. Gallagher promptly launched his own “lifestyle” clothing line and signed on as a spokesman for various dietary supplements, which appear to be inordinately popular among the right.

Right-wing media is very much a part of this profitable ecosystem. It’s a self-sustaining world also composed of think tanks, lobbyists, evangelical churches, schools and universities, all generously financed by corporations and deep-pocketed benefactors such as the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson. As The New York Times’ Paul Krugman has written, if you follow the money, it leads to jobs and wealth for those who peddle right-wing dogma – an argument that he uses to explain the reluctance of elected Republicans to criticize Mr. Trump, even after they’ve left Capitol Hill.

But what sets the right-wing media apart from its broader right-wing universe is that to hold on to viewers – and keep the advertising dollars rolling in – it has to keep ratcheting up the sensationalism.

In a review of the book Network Propaganda, Jeffrey Toobin explained the process: “False stories are launched on a series of extreme web sites, such as [Alex Jones’s] InfoWars … Those stories are then transmitted to outlets such as Fox News and the Daily Caller, which, according to the authors, ‘do claim to follow journalistic norms,’ but often fail in that function when it comes to tales from the web sites.”

Once used to this steady diet of red meat, viewers lose their taste for milder fare. After the death of civil-rights icon John Lewis this summer, Fox News did what any normal all-news network would do: it ran his Atlanta funeral service live on air. But its ratings, in the words of one media observer, “fell off a cliff” when its regular viewers abandoned the coverage in droves.

As a result of this climate, an increasingly radicalized segment of the electorate was drawn to figures such as Mr. Trump, whose policies and rhetoric would have made him unelectable a decade earlier. It is an endless cycle that radicalizes viewers and monetizes that radicalization – with the purveyors laughing all the way to the bank.

That’s why the Trump phenomenon isn’t at play here: the simple demographic reasons of our population size, and as a result, the inability to generate a huge economic payout.

Just ask Pierre-Karl Péladeau. In 2011, the separatist Quebec media mogul, working with associates of then-prime minister Stephen Harper, launched the Sun News Network. The television network was a fiasco in real time, finally shuttering in 2015, having lost an impressive $46.7-million in three years. The network was attracting only 8,000 viewers at any given moment.

The sunk costs of television production (on-air talent, the technicians, studios and equipment) are considerable. Even Sun News required a staff of 200 to operate. And these costs don’t vary significantly based on audience size, at least not in the startup years. Over time, the salaries of stars – based on ratings and thanks to ad revenue – might rise, but the initial set-up costs of a Sun News and a Fox News are comparable. What’s not comparable: a U.S. viewing audience that is many times larger, and thus infinitely more profitable.

Sun News is just the most dramatic example of how Canada’s national makeup and economy of scale protect us from the most noxious manifestations of right-wing politics. The same is largely true online, even though large budgets are less essential in that industry; Rebel News and The Post Millennial both preach their disinformation to a tiny coterie of aficionados, therefore limiting advertisers’ interest.

Indeed, Canadian right-wing “personalities” who do attract a higher profile – people such as the gender-contrarian Jordan Peterson and the white supremacist Faith Goldy – tend to market themselves to the U.S. right-wing ecosystem, where the real money is.

Canadians, of course, are not a uniquely virtuous or tolerant people. Our history – which includes residential schools, the Chinese head tax, the Manitoba Schools Act, and the internment of Japanese Canadians, just to name a few – has its fair share of shameful episodes. The Quebec City mosque massacre of 2017 and this year’s mass murders in Nova Scotia show that we are not immune to the toxins of hate that infect so much of the modern world.

Good fortune – and the hidden advantages of our size – have protected us from the particular scourge of Trumpism. But it isn’t infection that poses the danger to us; it’s what Trumpism is doing to a neighbour to whom we are tightly bound. The presidential election is far from over, and as a result, so is the danger to Canada. After all, electing Mr. Trump once might have been an accident, but electing him twice would be a sign of anti-democratic pathology on the part of Americans – and it’s always a bad move to cast one’s lot with the pathological.

With the resignation of Bill Morneau, the Liberal Party of Canada has added another name to its historical finance-minister hit list. Mr. Morneau joins Walter Gordon in 1965, John Turner in 1975 and Paul Martin in 2002 as victims of insurrection and counterinsurgency in a party at the centre of Canada’s political landscape. And it’s so often the same story: death by internal sniping and anonymous leaks, fueled by clashing egos and differing visions for the country.

The Liberal Party is certainly not the only Canadian home for intraparty squabbles. George Perlin’s 1980 book The Tory Syndrome reflects the disparate camps that long jockeyed within the Progressive Conservatives; the warring tribalism that produced splinters in the Reform Party and the Canadian Alliance was eventually quelled by the reconstituted Conservative Party. But these new Tories have been generally united, or at the very least, have tended to keep the infighting to when they’re not in power. Meanwhile, the New Democrats have a strict culture of closed ranks, and typically hang their dirty laundry in private.

Even Gerald Butts, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s former principal secretary, has noted the Liberals’ seemingly unique Machiavellian instincts. “Liberals are more lethal to Liberals than are any competing partisans. Canadians have little patience for this stuff in the best of times, and these are not those,” he said on Twitter this week. “Friendly advice to former colleagues: knock it off, unless you miss losing.”

Why does the Liberal Party seem to have its worst fights when it’s on top? Much of it has to do with the confidence that comes with winning so often that the Liberals have become seen by some as Canada’s “natural governing party.” That makes the party’s leadership a particularly powerful prize, especially because, between 1887 and 2006, no permanent Liberal leader had failed to eventually become Prime Minister.

The party’s internal arguments in recent decades have as often been about electoral strategy and policy direction as about brokering the spoils of inevitable-seeming victory. It is a party where powerful men (and it is always men) constantly fight to be the alpha – harnessing different ideological strains within the large, creaking machine to undermine each other.

In the mid-20th century, Liberal leaders Mackenzie King, Louis St. Laurent and Lester Pearson were remarkably effective at keeping together two of the party’s most vital camps – wealthy “business Liberals” from Corporate Canada, and those who espoused “welfare liberalism.” But when the rise of Quebec separatism and other national unity tensions were added to the mix, Pierre Trudeau – who was somewhat indifferent to the business/welfare distinction, but had exceptionally firm views on the constitution and Quebec’s place in the federation – took advantage of these increasingly complex fault lines. Business and welfare Liberals could band together in Mr. Trudeau’s unyielding centralist and centrist vision.

At around the same time, the party’s leadership races were becoming more fractured and bitter. From 1919 to 1968, these races had largely been simple acts of succession, where heirs apparent cruised to mostly inevitable victories before reigning at their relative pleasure. But the 1968 leadership race was wide open, becoming a clash of titans from Mr. Pearson’s well-stocked cabinet.

Mr. Trudeau eventually beat out Robert Winters, who summarily re-retired from politics, but loyalists of third-place finisher Mr. Turner – the “195 Club,” referring to the number of votes he won – became determined to make sure their man was the next leader. And for the next 40 years or so, the fortunes of the Liberal Party revolved around many of the dynamics sparked in that 1968 race, in which runners-up challenged leaders, even if the leaders were still in office.

Mr. Turner stuck it out in Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet for seven years before departing in 1975, allegedly over policy disagreements but with an obvious impatience that his political career had flatlined under an entrenched leader. Mr. Turner, anchored in the “business Liberal” side of the party, then led a less-than-subtle campaign to be his successor.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Turner did wind up winning the leadership in 1984, but only by stepping on the ambitions of popular Trudeau-era cabinet minister Jean Chrétien. Mr. Chrétien soon undertook his own political exile and an even less subtle and sometimes vicious campaign to take down Mr. Turner, who led the Liberals to a disastrous showing against Brian Mulroney, before losing another election and eventually his job in 1988. Like Mr. Trudeau, Mr. Chrétien was able to slip into business and welfare liberalism depending on the context, but also espoused strong views on federalism, so he was able to link his personal ambitions to larger policy issues in the party.

When Mr. Turner finally resigned, Mr. Chrétien won the top job over Paul Martin, the star-candidate son of a long-time Liberal cabinet minister who was himself edged out of his own leadership dreams. The rivalry between Mr. Chrétien and Mr. Martin, who was seen as an ideological successor to Mr. Turner, defined the party for over a decade until Mr. Martin finally prevailed in 2003. But his prize was a bitterly split party.

Vestiges of these duelling camps lingered after Mr. Martin resigned in 2006, through Stéphane Dion, a Chrétien protegé who was eventually undercut by supporters of Michael Ignatieff, who was more associated with Martinites (though these lines blurred over time).

Exhausted by 40 years of infighting, the Liberal Party went to hell and back in the 2000s, culminating in its humiliating third-place finish in the 2011 election amid questions whether it could even survive. This meltdown reset the party, mostly clearing the deck of old rivalries. The 2013 leadership race appeared to be a return to old patterns, with heir apparent Justin Trudeau, but there was no major runner-up to serve in the traditional role of sore loser. Mr. Trudeau’s miraculous majority in the 2015 election further cemented his pre-eminence. The Liberals seemed to have finally shed their decades-old bad habits.

But Mr. Trudeau is beginning to show that old Liberal tendency to drive out those who oppose his will, first with Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, and now with Bill Morneau. None were direct rivals to Mr. Trudeau’s leadership, but they challenged him on policy decisions and directions. That growing imperialism in the face of principled colleagues only anticipates further defenestrations. And the history of the party suggests that, sooner or later, someone will begin an insurrection campaign, even if the Liberals are still in power.

That’s what makes Mr. Butts’s warning somewhat ironic; there is an implication that Liberals should be lining up to unite behind, not fight, his friend and current leader, for the good of government. Still, he’s right: The greatest threat to the Liberal Party might just be members of the Liberal Party.

Amy Rosen is a freelance journalist and cookbook author.

By now, most of us realize things aren’t going back to normal any time soon and some of us will probably be working from home for awhile yet.

This got me thinking: What are the options for office workers used to gathering for meetings and brainstorming sessions? Where to hold the water-cooler talks and team-building experiences? What to do when we finally succumb to Zoom fatigue? In other words, where is there enough space for co-workers to safely gather while their office spaces are temporarily off-limits?

Here’s one possibility: Restaurants, bars and food halls have enough room to create co-working spaces that can be pre-booked and time-allotted. A meal, a meeting and a boost to both morale and the hospitality industry. In other words, there’s never been a better time to bring back the three-martini lunch!

In England, they’re calling it “pubworking” – a way to help newbie home workers cope with their newfound loneliness. As someone who’s been a freelancer for most of my career, I’m accustomed to lots of alone time. Having always dealt with editors over e-mail and the phone, the adjustment for me has been negligible. But when I did work in an office, I loved the camaraderie – the whiteboard meetings, the group lunches, competitive snack smack-downs and after-work drinks. And part of my freelance lifestyle has always included daily or evening meet-ups with friends and workmates, so even I suddenly miss the water cooler chat. Talking about Tiger King or the Raptors over FaceTime isn’t nearly as satisfying as discussing it over a postwork beer.

The good news is some of these chats can now take place at The Chickadee Room in Juke in Vancouver. Co-owner Justin Tisdall says that when the pandemic first hit, they were inundated with calls from companies doing simultaneous take-out orders for 20 workers at 20 different addresses so they could all “eat together” during Zoom meetings. That was step one, he says. Step two involved building out their small space while focusing on the idea that people would soon want to gather face to face in a safe and meaningful way.

“Right now we have about 16 seats so people can rent us out for lunch,” Mr. Tisdall says. “They have their own space and we have dividers between the tables so they can even socially distance within their own group.” The staff wears masks and gloves, and is behind Plexiglas.

It’s contactless ordering, too: Food and drinks are ordered from a smartphone app and there are drop stations on each table. The cost for a buyout during the day starts at $500 including food (beer, wine and cider are extra), and if you want some added team-building fun, you can request a bartender and they’ll shake up some nice cocktails.

“We see it as a way that you can get co-workers interacting safely while people are still apprehensive about going out,” Mr. Tisdall says. “When we were doing the build-out we thought, how can we make things more safe and secure and relaxing for them? It wasn’t to promote sales, it was about doing the right thing.”

For the most part, strategy meetings over steak suppers have long been replaced by sad desk salads in our modern go-go era, but not so at The Rights Factory. In lieu of a bricks-and-mortar office, long lunches with teammates is how chief executive Sam Hiyate says his literacy agency has always gotten the intimate time needed for strategizing “and feeling close to co-workers and clients rather than using weird online tools.”

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Hiyate’s business is one where face to face is the norm and he’s been back to Café Diplomatico and Bar Centrale in Toronto for patio lunches. “I’m trying to do weekly restaurant meetings now.”

It’s an idea that’s growing. The Flexday app, a Toronto startup that launched in 2017, seems almost prescient now. The idea behind it is that during restaurants’ typical downtimes (which have increased to almost always during the pandemic), empty tables at restaurants transform into workspaces. Users pay a monthly membership fee or can opt for an unlimited Flexday plan for $99 a month – less than the cost of a month’s worth of lattes. For harried parents who have been booking themselves into hotel rooms to get work done, this seems to be a more tenable solution for safe, productive meetings.

Much is lost when meetings are held digitally instead of in 3-D. Especially in a group situation, where eye contact and focusing attention on one team member can only really happen in person. Facial expressions, gestures and body language aren’t as obvious on the computer screen, and digital lag time is commonplace. Miscommunications increase and joyful camaraderie decreases.

And while you may find yourself more productive without the dreaded desk drop-by interruptions, suddenly, you also find yourself wistfully missing them. Who would have thought we’d grow nostalgic for Phil from accounting?

Justin Tang/The Canadian Press

Donna Dasko is an Ontario Senator and former pollster.

On July 31, many weeks after the initial announcement, the governments of Canada and Ontario launched the voluntary, privacy-first COVID Alert smartphone app. The government of Alberta just announced that it, too, will adopt the app, meaning a big win for public health could be in the works.

COVID Alert is best described as an exposure notification app. If a user tests positive in Ontario, they are provided with a single-use code by Ontario Public Health, which the user can choose to enter into the app. At that point, all devices within two metres of the user for more than 15 minutes over the prior two weeks will receive an exposure notice.

Story continues below advertisement

The app does not store information about individuals, locations or times of contact. Therefore, users will not be able to determine where or when they were exposed to the virus; they will simply be informed that they were exposed and can then decide if they want to get tested. Canadians are thought to be especially privacy-sensitive, so it is not surprising that privacy considerations have dominated this app’s operations. The privacy commissioners for Canada and Ontario both reviewed the app and gave it their approval. Daniel Therrien, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, said he will be using the app himself.

The importance of privacy considerations, however, means we are left with an app that apparently provides minimal support to public-health authorities in their efforts to track and trace the spread of this virus. For instance, some experts have expressed concern that the app cannot be integrated with traditional contact-tracing methods, which means contact tracers will still need to manually track down those who have been potentially exposed to COVID-19.

The ability to collect data and measure the effectiveness of the app in reducing the spread of the virus is integral to understanding its usefulness and improving its design, but there are questions here, too. Will public-health authorities ask Ontarians about their use of the app at COVID-19 testing facilities? Can public-health institutions collect data on how many users receive notifications?

One key measure of success will be the number of Canadians who download the app, but there are concerns on this point as well. On June 26, Stephen Lucas, the federal Deputy Minister of Health, told the Senate standing committee on social affairs, science and technology that the utility of contact-tracing apps is maximized when they are used by between 50 per cent and 60 per cent of the population. Dr. Lucas stated that the goal should be to have the app in the hands of about half of all Canadians.

Conditions are ideal for public uptake. A national poll commissioned by myself and senators Rosemary Moodie and Colin Deacon this spring found considerable support among the public for using such an app. Of the respondents, 82 per cent said they wanted to be anonymously notified via a smartphone if they were exposed to the virus, and 92 per cent said they were willing to share the results of a positive test so others could be notified.

Canadians show high levels of trust in public-health authorities and are motivated to act in this crisis by concerns about their own health, that of their families and of Canadians as a whole.

Still, translating such sentiments into action requires a huge effort, and achieving that 50-per-cent figure is a tall order.

Story continues below advertisement

A Leger poll released on Aug. 11 found that just 14 per cent of Canadians had downloaded the app, 20 per cent said they planned to download it, while the remainder said they either would not download it or were not sure. A Mainstreet Research poll released Aug. 14 found the app download rate among Canadians was around 21 per cent.

According to a report from technology news site The Logic, the federal government will spend $10-million raising public awareness of the app, which is welcome news, but details have yet to be provided and no campaign is yet visible.

A major public awareness and marketing campaign is needed, and the messages must be consistent, clear and constant in order to convince Canadians that COVID Alert is an important tool in fighting the pandemic.

Appropriate target markets should be identified, with a particular focus on the younger, more mobile segments of the population who are most likely to benefit from using the app.

Public-health officials must be involved, much like they have been in delivering messages about physical distancing, hand washing and wearing masks, and they must find credible spokespeople to assist.

In the development of this app, the government made a host of compromises that increase privacy at the expense of greater utility.

Now launched, it is time to highlight those safeguards and encourage Canadians to download this app through a serious public health campaign. Otherwise, why launch it in the first place?

Liberal life

Re Morneau’s Office, Kielburgers Described As ‘Besties’ In Newly Released Documents (Aug. 20): I continue to believe that the press has been biased against Bill Morneau in its treatment of the WE Charity scandal.

Most stories, including in-depth ones, fail to report that the non-invoiced cost of more than $41,000, for a trip to solicit support, resulted in donations from Mr. Morneau’s foundation totalling $100,000. In addition, other trips taken by Mr. Morneau with expenses over $50,000 were duly paid.

Mr. Morneau’s oversight may have been bad, but it was not terrible. Financially, WE – not Mr. Morneau – came out on top.

Jim Fleck Toronto

Re Power And Prorogation (Letters, Aug. 20): I worked in Finance Canada over half my career. The central agency sets economic, fiscal and tax frameworks for the public interest; acts as a challenge function on federal economic and social policy; works with provinces on transfers and other issues, and other countries on economic and trade issues. It does so with a large cadre of experts, including its senior executives and deputy minister.

The finance minister needs to be very smart, have a backbone, understand tradeoffs and brook no fools. Bay Street can’t claim a corner on these traits, more often providing a blinker on many issues. I find that Chrystia Freeland has these qualities and more. We know: Men with her CV would be praised as good fits.

L. J. Ridgeway Ottawa

I believe it does no good to compare the actions of a prime minister 50 years ago to one today, especially when the only similarity is the same last name. The time to have a government that takes strong centralized action is during a pandemic – look at the results of the weak U.S. response.

As well, Pierre and Justin Trudeau are not the only prime ministers who have taken control. Stephen Harper prorogued Parliament four times and was known to limit or vet questions at news conferences.

Let’s judge government action in terms of the situation, not the name of who is doing it.

Re TDSB To Finalize New Back-to-school Plan This Week (Aug. 20): We are part of the French public school board Conseil scolaire Viamonde. Our situation seems to be completely the opposite of what is being reported.

We have received very detailed communication from the board. We were surveyed on whether we would send our child back to school or go totally online, and what technology we had at home. A website provides up-to-date guidelines and protocols.

Our school will provide five days of in-person schooling; teachers will provide the divisive 300 minutes per day of instruction; the breakfast program will be back with individual bag distribution; children will be placed in cohorts and they will wear masks.

Yes, there will be adjustments to make and there are still unknowns, but this is the world we live in right now. It seems that our board, schools, unions, teachers and other staff – everyone is making efforts to work together for the good of our children.

Do not come from away

In response to contributor Michael Bryant’s question, “Has COVID-19 quietly killed Canadian Confederation?” (Aug. 14) I would answer no.

Public-health measures do not weaken Confederation. Viruses naturally spread from regions where per capita infection rates are higher into regions where rates are lower. That is math, not law, politics nor public opinion.

Viruses are not carried by raindrops. They are carried by people. To impede the dispersion of COVID-19, jurisdictions must erect barriers to mobility, ugly as they are, between nations, states or provinces, municipalities and even dwellings.

The boundaries of Newfoundland and Labrador are as logical as any other place to locate yet another impediment to COVID-19 propagation. I would not sue to break Newfoundland’s boundary restrictions any more than I would sue to get on the Toronto subway without a mask, or to hold a house party for 200 guests in Montreal.

The right stuff

Re Out Of Line (Letters, Aug. 14): As a Day 1 volunteer ambassador for the Canadian Museum for Human Rights who logged more than 1,200 hours of volunteering and 250 hours of training, I can say that at no time did I feel the “tyranny” of the CMHR’s design and programming, as one letter-writer put it.

We were trained to ask guests about their interests, which allowed us to make informed suggestions and provided directions. They were additionally “empowered to make choices, including serendipitous, conscious self-selection” with the aid of detailed pamphlets and the option of group tours tailored to specific galleries. Schoolchildren were provided with content collaboratively designed and delivered by educators and museum staff.

The CMHR has received in excess of 30 international, national and regional awards. Tyranny is seldom celebrated by such levels of praise.

Brian Head Sidney, B.C.

Lead by example

Re It’s Well Past Time To Stand Up To Systemic Prejudice (Report on Business, Aug. 14): Kudos to contributor Tony Comper for leveraging his wealth, name and connections for social good. A greater challenge for business leaders likely lies in the workplace. The Governor-General, Ellen DeGeneres, the former director general of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and, of course, Donald Trump – they all suggest that successful individuals frequently create toxic workplaces as leaders.

Could similarly public-minded business leaders such as Mr. Comper differentiate those who demand high performance (as those toxic leaders would self-describe) from those who make unreasonable demands and inflict belittling tyrannies? It’s a greater challenge, as this leadership style persists because it often drives results. Are there workable boundaries on winning at all costs?

Story continues below advertisement

“Let us commit … never to be bystanders,” Mr. Comper writes, but in hierarchical workplaces, employee voices may not be heard or may suffer negative consequences. The onus should be on those with power – the peers and superiors of alleged perpetrators.

Chester Fedoruk Toronto

Past due

Re Does Not Equate (Letters, Aug. 20): I believe a letter-writer misconstrues my original letter of Aug. 19.

What is scandalous about the Meng Wanzhou case is the time it is taking to get to trial. It will be more than two years since her arrest.

This case should have been disposed of within three months. If it had been, then Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor would likely have been freed long ago.

Bill Morneau, who was pushed out of the job by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this week, was a prototypical finance minister – a man with business experience in the private sector and ties to Bay Street, Canada’s nexus of bankers and investors in Toronto.

Before him, it was Michael Wilson who most fit the prototype. He was a Bay Street investment executive before he became Brian Mulroney’s finance minister in 1984. He helped craft the free-trade agreement with the United States and introduced the GST. He later helped negotiate the North American free-trade agreement.

It makes sense to have someone embedded in Canada’s business world oversee the nation’s finances. But it’s a mistake to believe that’s the only acceptable curriculum vitae for the most important job in the federal cabinet outside of prime minister.

Jim Flaherty, after whom the Finance Canada building in Ottawa is named, did not follow the old path. He worked as a personal injury lawyer before entering Ontario provincial politics, where he served as labour minister and attorney-general, before he rose to finance minister. In 2006, he became Stephen Harper’s finance minister – and guided Canada through the 2008-09 global financial crisis.

In British Columbia, the province whose finances are arguably the strongest in the country, Carole James worked in social services before extensive local and provincial political experience led to her appointment as B.C. Finance Minister in 2017. She has presided over budgets that balance prudence and ambition, work this page has supported.

Chrystia Freeland, who was named federal Finance Minister on Tuesday, also defies the old archetype.

She is the first woman in the job in Canada’s history, and she has never worked in banking or finance. Some have questioned her qualifications, given the intense pressure on government finances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Her résumé, however, is sterling. From an early start as deputy editor of this newspaper, she went on to senior jobs at the Financial Times and Thomson Reuters. Her 2012 book Plutocrats was an investigation of the world’s richest people and the global problem of income inequality.

In government, as minister of international trade, Ms. Freeland, like Mr. Wilson, has had her hands all over major trade deals. She earned praise for leading Canada’s defence of NAFTA, and for negotiating the subsequent Canada-Mexico-United States Agreement.

In 2018, as foreign minister, she was named diplomat of the year by Washington’s Foreign Policy magazine. She is considered a savvy negotiator and a good listener (a skill Mr. Morneau lacked), and she’s tough – standing up to, and earning the ire of, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump.

She’s made mistakes. Criticizing Saudi Arabia on Twitter was miscalculated. Worse, she and the Liberal government have badly underestimated Xi Jinping’s China.

But Ms. Freeland has the experience and abilities needed in these troubled times. Her toughest job, in fact, may be having to stand up to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, what with his disdain for contrary opinions. A finance minister can only be as good as her advice being heard and acted on.

Given that Mr. Trudeau and Ms. Freeland seem to agree on an expansionary agenda, there may be little friction between them. Mr. Trudeau outlined big ambitions this week when he prorogued Parliament and announced his government will deliver a Throne Speech on Sept. 23. He also made the case for Canada’s fiscal capacity to deliver expanded programs through deficit spending.

This page supports policies such as pharmacare, and has argued repeatedly that Canada can shoulder rising debt while tackling national challenges in health, education and poverty. But it won’t be easy. Ms. Freeland’s role will be to oversee the judicious pursuit of an ambitious agenda. As Mr. Trudeau’s minority government pushes new ideas, restraint will still be essential.

What is certain is Ms. Freeland is well qualified for the job. Her career has been defined by a critical, outsider eye on the worlds of politics, finance and trade, and her accomplishments compare easily with those of her successful forebears.

A flurry of media attention greeted the release earlier this month of new clinical guidelines for treating “obesity.” Dubbed a “paradigm shift,” these guidelines are summarized and published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. The authors elaborate on the guidelines on the website of Obesity Canada, which oversaw this project with the Canadian Association of Bariatric Physicians and Surgeons.

Calling on health care workers and policy-makers to address weight bias and stigma – what others call fatphobia – the authors make five key recommendations, including asking permission “to offer advice and help treat this disease in an unbiased manner,” and assisting a patient with “identifying the root causes, complications and barriers to obesity treatment.”

So, what is wrong with tackling bias and stigma? After all, many support efforts to counter stigma and fatphobia in society and especially in health care institutions.

The trouble with the guidelines – and other efforts to encourage so-called “healthy living” – is that they seek to sensitize others to the dangers of stigma but cling to a model that pathologizes obesity as a disease. While the authors acknowledge that the body mass index (BMI) is a poor measure of health, they still circle back to weight loss or bariatric surgery as possible “treatments.” So obesity may be complex, but it is still seen as a disease that can be managed medically.

Many scientists, scholars and fat activists alike reject the notion that their bodies are diseased, and encourage us to see fatness as a healthy form of bodily diversity. They use the term “fat” deliberately to reclaim a word that has been used to harm people.

Many obesity researchers steer clear of the term fat, preferring people-first language such as “person living with obesity,” which they say humanizes fat people. But were fat people not quite human in the first place? People-first language is not somehow instantly empowering. Some communities reject it because it distances the person from their identity. For instance, saying “disabled person” can be seen as less pathologizing than “person with a disability.” And disability communities can teach all of us a thing or two about having your humanity called into question.

Fat people are not the only victims of hatred and discrimination, of course. The structures and systems that devalue fat bodies are linked to other forms of oppression rooted in race, gender and ability. There is much to learn, for instance, from connecting the dots between fat oppression and racism.

In her recent book, Fearing the Black Body: The Racial Origins of Fat Phobia, author Sabrina Strings explains how fatphobia is rooted in white supremacy, arguing that “the slender ideal and fat phobia are not distinct developments... The fear of the imagined ‘fat black woman’ was created by racial and religious ideologies that have been used to both degrade black women and discipline white women.”

Health care for fat people is still delivered in a system with a firm hierarchy between patient and health care provider. Suggesting that physicians refrain from raising the issue of weight unless their patient does seems naive at best. Patients are hardly in a position to push back against a fatphobic or racist physician. This is not a marketplace in which individual patients simply move on to the next physician if they don’t like the service they are receiving.

Fat people avoid visiting doctors because they dread being the object of shame and judgment. In 2018, Ellen Maud Bennett died of complications from cancer after spending years being told that she would feel better if she just lost weight. She took the unusual step of writing her own obituary to call attention to fat shaming. Physicians use a dehumanizing, “secret language” to talk about their fat patients.

Fatphobia is fuelled by outdated ideas about “normal” bodies, and by the suggestion that individuals should know better than to let their weight spiral out of control. Despite evidence of the pernicious effects of the weight-loss industry, there is a stubborn acceptance that by managing our weight, we can gain personal and social transformation.

Efforts that purport to turn the page on weight bias need to genuinely move beyond weight as a measure of health, rather than wrap their interventions in the cloak of anti-stigma.

Kevin Lynch is the former vice chair of BMO Financial Group and former clerk of the Privy Council.

Policy interventions in crises face the age-old challenge of moral hazard – the economic concept that an entity protected in some way from risk will behave differently than if it did not have that protection. Without the proper safeguards, good intentions can lead to unintended outcomes.

The government has deployed a panoply of policy instruments – unprecedented in scope and scale – to address the effects of COVID-19 lockdowns on employment, incomes and liquidity. The aid has been vital for many Canadian households and businesses. And since none of the recipients contributed to the cause of the crisis, moral hazard may not seem to be a top-of-mind concern. But moral hazard is about unintended responses to policy, no matter how well-intentioned the objective. It is present in the government’s actions in this crisis, and needs to be addressed.

First, the Prime Minister’s repeated message that “the government has your back” offered the needed assurance to Canadians that government would help them with their employment and income losses. But the assurance, delivered through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and other direct payments, has turned into transfers to households totalling $65.3-billion in the first half of this year – 150 per cent of the actual employment income losses of Canadians ($44.6-billion), according to the Department of Finance’s July Economic and Fiscal Snapshot. It is as if an insurer agreed to cover substantially more than the actual losses in the case of an accident – something that runs counter to basic principles.

The challenge today is how best to restart the economy with unresolved pandemic risks that may last for many months if not years. The widespread return to work will require appropriate public-health safeguards including testing, tracing, physical distancing, masks and workplace redesign. It will also require that temporary support programs do not create unintended disincentives.

However, that is what CERB and other transfers do. If workers can earn more income staying home safely, there is no economic incentive to rejoin the work force. Moreover, if the perception sets in that government can insure them against all risks all the time, the behavioural response may be resistance to change, including training for new or better jobs. To counter this moral hazard, programs should pivot from solely supporting income to promoting adjustment. This will be an important litmus test for the just announced winding down of the CERB, with changes to eligibility rules to Employment Insurance and new income support measures.

Second, the government has been massively flowing credit and aid to business to help provide liquidity to firms hurt by revenue losses. An inevitable side effect is more and more private sector debt piled on top of corporate and household debt levels that were already worrisome before the pandemic struck. Like many strong medicines, the longer you take it, the greater the chance of addiction. The moral hazard arises from expectations that some temporary assistance will become indefinite, and that some private debt will be forgiven, effectively nationalized. Since the aid is based on the needs of firms – not their economic performance – the further unintended outcome would be a misallocation of both public and private capital, impairing Canada’s long-term growth capacity.

Third, the government is borrowing massive amounts of money to finance its exceptional interventions, with the support of the Bank of Canada and accommodating financial markets. And yet, thanks to historically low interest rates, government debt servicing costs will actually decline this year. It is as if, magically, the added debt is free and unprecedented deficits are costless.

But they are not, and therein lies the moral hazard. We have remortgaged the house to get through the pandemic, as we should, but now we must pay for it, otherwise we are creating intergenerational inequity by effectively taxing future generations for today’s crisis. The way to address this particular moral hazard is a clear and credible economic and fiscal plan.

This brings us back to where we were before COVID-19, but with even greater urgency: the need to innovate, to raise productivity and to be competitive in the global economy. An unprecedented crisis called for extraordinary measures. As we move forward, avoiding or deferring the structural reforms required to grow our standard of living sustainably and inclusively would be the greatest moral hazard for Canadians.

She served as chargé d’affaires in Moscow in 2019.

When the people have had enough, they will mobilize to secure their freedom.

That is the message from Belarus, a former Soviet republic at the heart of Europe. It all started when Svetlana Tikhanovskaya – whose activist husband, Sergei, was arrested in May – announced she would run for the presidency in his place against incumbent Alexander Lukashenko, who has been Belarus’s dictator since 1994. With the support of Veronika Tsepkalo and Maria Kolesnikova, two women representing opposition politicians barred from running, she rallied Belarusians against the thuggish President.

As expected, however, the election was rigged, with Mr. Lukashenko claiming victory with 80 per cent of the vote. Security services unleashed a wave of violence on protesters, arresting and torturing them; Ms. Tikhanovskaya herself was forced to flee to Lithuania. As Belorussian Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich aptly put it: “The authorities have declared war on the people.”

Since then, hundreds of thousands of ordinary Belarusians have continued to take to the streets in support of free elections. And it’s not just young urban intellectuals calling for an end to Mr. Lukashenko’s dictatorship – it’s factory workers, the state-controlled media and everyday people from across the country. The streets have thrummed with euphoria after years of pent-up frustration.

Geopolitical factors are part of the story, too. Sandwiched between Russia and the West – a victim of its geography and history – Belarus has been a battleground for armies, the site of some of the worst Nazi atrocities of the Holocaust, and a victim of the effects of the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown. While revolutions of the late 1980s liberated much of Central and Eastern Europe from communism and Soviet rule, this corner of the former Soviet bloc remained tied to Moscow.

Unlike in neighbouring countries, there is no deep reservoir of anti-Russian sentiment in Belarus, and many Belarusians had been largely happy to trade freedom for a dysfunctional legacy of inefficient industries propped up by cheap Russian energy. When the economy began to falter, however, Mr. Lukashenko tried to play nationalist and energy politics with Moscow, only to find himself out of his depth and increasingly at odds with both his patrons and his own population. Then COVID-19 made a bad situation even worse.

What is happening in Belarus is a continuation of the unfinished fight for freedom that began 30 years ago.

From the perspective of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mr. Lukashenko had a simple job: keep the people down, the EU out and Russian gas flowing westward through the strategic pipelines that cross the territory of Belarus. The instability and unpredictability that characterize the current situation are anathema. Mr. Putin has his own domestic troubles and critics, not only in Moscow but as far away as Khabarovsk, a normally quiet city in the Far East that has been the scene of protests over the summer; already, the Russian opposition has drawn parallels with the unrest in Belarus.

It is impossible to predict how this will play out, but one thing is certain: Mr. Putin will be looking for a solution. It is not in Moscow’s interest to engage its military or security forces, which would cause bloodshed and make Belarus’s problems its own. However, the prospect of an unknown government that might move Belarus away from Russia and closer to Europe would rattle the Kremlin. More likely, Moscow will try to orchestrate a transfer of power to reliable and trusted figures within the regime, perhaps with some feint at democratic reform. Although Mr. Lukashenko has ordered further crackdowns, he may soon find himself either expendable or subject to pressure for a closer union with Russia.

Statements from the Canadian government in support of Ms. Tikhanovskaya and free elections are welcome, as far as they go. At an emergency summit, the EU rejected the election outcome and agreed to sanction those involved in violence and repression, even as Russia warns against foreign interference. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe has offered to broker peace; it would be well-placed to do so given its expertise in human rights, elections and democracy.

Despite troubles closer to home for Canadians, what is happening in Belarus is important. Not just because of its strategic location at the centre of Europe at a time when Western relations with Russia are more difficult than at any time since the Cold War, but because it proves that even when human rights seem most at risk, and when propaganda and disinformation runs rampant, the desire for freedom is universal and irrepressible. To achieve that, for all, is the unfinished business of the 20th century. Authoritarians everywhere should take note.

Tony Avelar/The Canadian Press

Janelle Joseph is assistant professor at the Faculty of Kinesiology and Physical Education and the founder and director of IDEAS Lab (Indigeneity, Diaspora, Equity and Anti-Racism in Sport) at the University of Toronto. Sabrina Razack is a PhD candidate and manager at IDEAS Lab.

The newly released video of Masai Ujiri’s altercation with Alan Strickland, an Alameda County sheriff’s deputy, dispels a widely held belief that the NBA is shielded from anti-Black racism. Blacks in the NBA are hypervisible. Adored by fans globally, many champions enjoy legendary status. Yet players can instantly be reduced to objects and reminded of their “place” in the racial order (see LeBron James and Russell Westbrook), and even team presidents are not immune. The overpolicing and hypersurveillance of Black bodies is as persistent in the NBA as it is in broader society.

Those who identify as Black in the NBA are from countries as diverse as the United States, Canada, Senegal, Nigeria, France and Greece, and account for 74.2% of all players. There is clear evidence of a systemic anti-Black racism problem when only 37.4 of all assistant coaches and 23.3 percent of head coaches identify as Black. CEOs, presidents and owners remain predominantly white males, which contributes to tensions surrounding much needed shifts in power and support for Black players and employees.

Let’s be clear, the NBA deserves to be commended for its leadership among professional sport leagues in addressing racial and gender equity. But despite the NBA’s apparent progressiveness, much more work is required to stem the anti-Black racism demonstrated in the behaviour of some fans and personnel employed in stadiums. As we see in this incident, the behaviour of institutions the NBA partners with, such as police forces, affects the sport.

Several videos have been released that clearly point to Mr. Ujiri attempting to get on to the court to celebrate the 2019 championship with his team. The newly released video reveals Mr. Ujiri reaching for his pass in his suit jacket inside pocket, and being denied the ability to show it. Mr. Strickland shoved Mr. Ujiri twice and he retaliated, pushing Mr. Strickland back once. Eventually, of course, Mr. Ujiri reached the court, but the celebrations of the Raptors’ championship victory were marred by initial reports incorrectly framing him as the aggressor in the scuffle, bringing the team president’s reputation and judgement into question. Mr. Strickland subsequently sued Mr. Ujiri, claiming injuries.

Some argue that Mr. Ujiri did not have the correct pass, or should have pulled out his credentials earlier. This refrain will be familiar to anyone with knowledge of racist restrictions on the travel of Black people in apartheid South Africa, or Canadian practices designed to confine First Nations to reserves. The military, police and sheriff’s deputies have been using unjustified violence, stereotypes and lies related to showing a pass as tools of white supremacy since the 1800s.

It is naive to think that this is the first time Mr. Ujiri has faced anti-Black racism in the sport world and beyond. Mr. Strickland might have taken a few seconds to read the pass, note the credentials and acknowledge that he did in fact have the right to be on the court, but who gets a “pass” in those situations? Not a Black NBA player attending his university graduation ceremony during playoffs, not a Black NFL player kneeling during the national anthem, not Black MLB players or stadium workers being berated by racist fans, and definitely not a Black president of an NBA team.

Michelle Obama felt the need to clarify her famous statement, “When they go low, we go high,” acknowledging the need for new tactics to combat anti-Black racism. Ms. Obama set the record straight and stated, “going high does not mean putting on a smile and saying nice things when confronted by viciousness and cruelty.”

What occurred to Mr. Ujiri was a cruel anti-Black racist act.

He will now have to “go high” and prove his innocence in court, a painful reminder of the failure of sporting institutions, even those with predominantly Black athletes, to eliminate anti-Black racism from their spaces. The good news is Mr. Ujiri is backed by a powerful legal team supported by the Raptors organization and its owner, MLSE. He is able to make headlines and fight back. The bad news is, every day there are countless racist acts in professional and recreational sports that don’t make headlines, involving players and coaches who don’t get support.

Mr. Ujiri’s fight is an individual example of the systemic anti-Black racism that plagues all sports. Administrators take note. Recruiting Black players and presidents solves only one problem: representation. Black bodies deserve the right to safety and respect, period. This recent incident and many others have shown that success does not shield athletes or leaders from anti-Black racism. Such change will require direct challenges to the structures and mindsets that perpetuate racism and this battle can’t be won by NBA champions alone. We must all get in the game and play overtime.

Power and prorogation

Re The Centralization Of Power In The PMO Is Now Complete With Freeland’s Appointment (Aug. 19): For those of us who worked in the public service during the years of Pierre Trudeau, the current centralization of power in the Prime Minister’s Office is simply more of the same.

Mr. Trudeau was the first prime minister to bypass the structure and machinery of government. The Privy Council Office became a clearing house for official papers and cabinet documents; major decisions were made by Mr. Trudeau’s inner circle.

Story continues below advertisement

The late Jean-Luc Pépin said wisely that “public servants must be political, but not partisan.” The role of the bureaucracy is to give options to politicians, not to offer partisan advice. But why bother with public servants at all? Quicker and easier to just do it all in the PMO and damn the torpedoes.

But if the inhabitants of the PMO think they are fooling the Canadian public, they would be wrong. The electorate is much smarter than what those in the inner circle are banking on.

Re Prorogation Halts WE Charity Hearings, Ends China Probe (Aug. 19): I am left to wonder if we have two sets of moral compasses in Canada, and how that will play in any attempt to unify the country in a coming election.

On one hand, we appear to have developed zero tolerance toward any institution, university or business that trips over a wide spectrum of faults relating to racism, history, bullying, sex, gender, climate or financial misdeeds.

Yet ethics violations, embarrassments on world stages and the prorogation of Parliament are swept away as quickly as possible. Why rant about other world leaders when we have our own glass house to protect?

Re With Morneau’s Exit, The Liberals Lose Their Voice Of Moderation (Report on Business, Aug. 19): Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative finance critic, is aghast that Chrystia Freeland might call for higher taxes.

The pandemic has starkly revealed society’s deficiencies. To redress these crucial needs, the government would have to increase tax revenue. It should be what we want, assuming that we want a country that attends to the well-being of its people.

For many years I’ve explained why I’m not a politician: My campaign slogan would be, “Vote for me for higher taxes.” However, I’ll happily vote for someone who understands that taxes are returned to citizens – with interest.

Richard Bachmann Burlington, Ont.

Re The Math On Morneau’s Exit Doesn’t Add Up (Editorial, Aug. 19): Many wonder why people become susceptible to the rhetoric of demagogues, as if it happens in a vacuum with little or no cause. But witness the machinations behind the sudden departure of Bill Morneau.

Citing Harry Frankfurt’s On Bullshit is both audacious and well-timed. I found that Justin Trudeau and Mr. Morneau were both disingenuous in their explanations, wasting precious time in reciting well-rehearsed talking points.

It seems the rules don’t apply to political elites as they do to ordinary folk. Mr. Trudeau’s résumé of missteps would have resulted in harsh discipline for a run-of-the-mill Canadian. This is what enrages many, and makes them susceptible to candidates who appeal to that anger.

Moses Wuggenig Toronto

Re Freeland Gets The Hardest Job In Canada (Aug. 19): While I have immense respect for Chrystia Freeland and her accomplishments, appointing her as Finance Minister, with no economic background, is questionable in my opinion.

It would be akin to a hospital chief executive appointing an employee of the year to chief of surgery. Surely there is someone in Canada better qualified to be finance minister (or perform surgery) at this critical time.

Why we help

Re From WE To Why: Revisiting The Purpose Of Charities (Aug. 17): Leaving WE Charity aside, it seems to me the fields that contributor Adam Parachin believes charities should be engaged in – patronage of the arts, medical research, religion etc. – go well beyond what reasonably deserves to be called charitable activity. I believe this thinking is why so many so-called charities are often nothing more than organizations run more for the benefit of a close-knit group of entitled promoters than for helping those in need.

It is an irony that in our capitalist societies, the veritable plethora of charitable organizations – with huge overhead expenses, overlaps and inefficiencies – were formed to fill gaps left uncovered by our adversarial systems of government. In a country with a well-administered, co-operative and egalitarian society, private charities should not be needed – it would all be government.

I am not talking of such organizations as the Red Cross or Médecins sans frontières (Doctors Without Borders). They, for humanitarian reasons, fill gaps in countries where we can offer assistance, but cannot improve the systems in the short term.

Charities provide services that governments can’t or won’t. As much as the Conservatives may want Canadians to believe otherwise, charities are not out-of-control money-laundering machines. People who work for and with charities are not money-grubbing criminals. People who volunteer are not scab labourers working for less than minimum wage.

The Prime Minister made a mistake. He admitted it and apologized. He has not gained in any way from his transgressions. Yet the message from the opposition seems to be: “Don’t cozy up to those nasty philanthropists.”

Do we hate politicians so much that we are willing to undermine the foundations of liberal society for revenge?

Rosco Bell Regina

Re WE Charity Registers To Lobby Ottawa, Lays Off Staff (Aug. 14): What exactly did Sofia Marquez, WE Charity’s former director of government and stakeholder relations, think was her job?

Methinks that WE thinks the law does not apply to friends of the Liberals and celebrity charity leaders.

For Nina Chandarana, one of the hardest parts about sending her two children back to school next month is what it will mean for her parents.

They live in a condo down the street, a location they chose in order to be close to their grandchildren. They often look after Ms. Chandarana’s seven-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son.

But with the COVID-19 risks that come with sending her kids back to school, the children will have to isolate from their grandparents.

“It’s going to be hard. My parents are a big part of our life and our kids’ life in a huge way,” said Ms. Chandarana, a performance coach and university instructor who lives in Toronto.

As millions of children across Canada head back to school, many parents are making the same decision to isolate their kids from their grandparents – at least until the risks of infection and transmission are overcome. The decision will have many undesirable consequences – from families losing out on the child care grandparents often provide to the emotional toll it will take on grandparents and grandchildren alike.

Given how difficult isolation can be, it is essential that families stay in touch however they can, said Robert Madan, the chief of psychiatry at Baycrest Health Sciences, a hospital for the elderly in Toronto.

“The older adult population wants to continue to be active and see family,” he said. “The regularity of contact through whatever means is important. It’s something to look forward to.”

That could mean a regularly scheduled phone call or talking over FaceTime, Dr. Madan said.

Although many parents are understandably worried about the health risks posed by sending children back to school, they shouldn’t rush to isolate children from their grandparents, said Nora Spinks, CEO of the Vanier Institute of the Family, a charitable organization based in Ottawa.

“The benefits of grandchild-grandparent connections are so rich and so important that we have to figure out a way to stay connected,” she said.

We need to “let the science guide us,” Ms. Spinks said. If the number of cases of COVID-19 remains low, it may still be safe for grandchildren to see their grandparents, she said. “We don’t want children and grandparents to miss out on the joy of multigenerational relationships because of COVID.”

A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that children nine and under infected others in their households 5.6 per cent of the time, whereas those between the ages of 10 and 19 spread the virus at the same rate as adults, almost 19 per cent of the time. With people 60 and older at particular risk of becoming very ill or dying from COVID-19, plus the uncertainty of how school environments might affect transmission of the virus, caution is certainly understandable.

Indeed, for many parents, their concerns over what might happen when kids return to school are simply too great to allow in-person contact with grandparents.

Which is why some parents are choosing to keep their kids out of school.

According to Statistics Canada’s 2017 general social survey, Canada is home to more than 7.5 million grandparents. For many, isolation will be next to impossible: There are more than 400,000 multigenerational households in Canada, according to the most recent census data.

“We don’t let my mom go anywhere except the doctor’s office,” Ms. Singh said. Her husband, a chef, has been sleeping in the basement to minimize his exposure to his mother-in-law.

The Singhs have decided not to send their daughter back to school for fear that doing so might expose her grandmother to the coronavirus.

“I don’t want to take that risk,” Ms. Singh said. “Reluctantly, we’re doing online [schooling].”

She may send her daughter to school “if things are good in January.”

Karen Johnson has been trying to spend as much time as possible with her two sons, 13 and 11, and her parents this summer – having family barbecues, bringing the boys to help her mother in the garden, having her parents come watch the boys play soccer and take part in other family activities – because she knows the boys will have to be kept away from their grandparents after school starts.

“Even now my boys are hesitant to hug my mom and dad,” said Ms. Johnson, who lives in Toronto.

She has been doing the shopping for her parents since March. Her father has a heart condition and diabetes – the kind of underlying conditions that make people vulnerable to serious COVID-19 outcomes – so when the family does get together, everyone wears masks.

“We only started going inside their house in June,” Ms. Johnson said.

Those times together have been a joy, she said. “We’re a very huggy family.”

But when the boys return to school, the family will revert to the physical-distancing measures they adopted in the spring.

“In September, for my dad’s birthday, we won’t be able to go into their house,” Ms. Johnson said. They may have cake on her deck. “No hugging, no kissing, very strict on the six feet apart.”

And the sleepovers at their grandparents’ house, when the boys get to stay up late and eat whatever they want, while Ms. Johnson and her husband enjoy some free time?

“That’s so off the table,” she said.

As difficult as it will be, she will make sure her sons stay in touch with her parents.

“They’re really close. So they talk on the phone. They’re in daily contact with my parents,” she said.

Ms. Chandarana wants her kids to return to school so they can spend time with their peers.

“From a social standpoint, it’s really so important,” she said.

She plans on isolating her kids from her parents for at least the first month of school. If the weather is nice enough in September and there is no sign of a spike in cases, she might allow her kids to go on walks with her parents on the condition they all stay six feet apart.

It would be a small gesture, but one that would be very good for her parents’ well-being, she said.

“Just being on their own, by themselves, is really challenging.”

Globe health columnist André Picard and senior editor Nicole MacIntyre discuss the many issues surrounding sending kids back to school. André says moving forward isn't about there being no COVID-19 cases, but limiting their number and severity through distancing, smaller classes, masks and good hygiene. The Globe and Mail

Veteran wine writer John Schreiner recently released his 16th book, an expansively updated version of his insider’s guide to British Columbia’s wineries. Written with Okanagan-based wine educator Luke Whittall, The Okanagan Wine Tour Guide shares noteworthy stories about the people and places that shape the province’s wine industry.

Originally titled John Schreiner’s Okanagan Wine Tour Guide, the first edition came out in 2006 and profiled 100 wineries. The up-to-date guide features 240 wineries, from 50th Parallel Estate to Young & Wyse Collection, while extending its coverage to include Lillooet and the Arrow Lakes regions for the first time. “There have never been more wine-touring opportunities in the British Columbia Interior,” the authors explain in the introduction.

The 2006 book spent 200 pages detailing everything to see and taste. The new volume comes in the same portable format – it’s glovebox-sized, according to the press release – but runs 520 pages as it covers producers operating throughout the Okanagan, Similkameen, Thompson and Kootenays.

Forty wineries have opened since the fifth edition was published in 2014. The current release features updated maps and listings for each featured vintner, including their website, address and wine recommendations. True to the established format, the information is concise and detailed, allowing readers to make the most of a visit.

The new book also includes some spotlight pages that collect wineries by location, including traditional enclaves such as Black Sage Road, Naramata, Okanagan Falls, Osoyoos Lake Bench and The Golden Mile and emerging areas such as Kaleden, on the west side of Skaha Lake. There’s also a page to represent eight producers who are so-called virtual wineries, operating without vineyards or licensed wineries of their own.

Having compiled numerous guides over his career, Schreiner knows they’re only as current as their publishing date. To extend its lifespan and usefulness, it includes some producers that have yet to open. For instance, Birch Block Vineyard has a proposed opening date of 2022, while Black Swift Vineyards, which is currently operating out of The Hatch facility, is preparing to open its own operation next year.

At 84 years of age, Schreiner has long since retired from his 40-year career as a business journalist. Wine writing developed as a sideline, with his first pieces published in 1974, and it continues to be his passion. He keeps tabs on current events and releases taking place in wine country from his home in North Vancouver. Usually a frequent visitor to the wine regions, he has worked from his residence since the COVID-19 outbreak. Nevertheless, there are routine updates to the blog, John Schreiner on wine, that he has run since August 2008.

As tasting rooms start to re-open through the Okanagan, this is an incredibly useful book to guide your way. It’s an equally enjoyable window on a world that some of us might not be in a position to visit again for a while.

Sharlene Hertz: Fundraiser. Teacher. Leader. Motivator. Born May 14, 1951, in Regina; died Feb. 29, 2020, in North Vancouver, of heart failure; aged 68.

You needed to be careful when you told Sharlene Hertz your dreams because she would make sure you achieved them, even if you were ready to give up. She was a woman who worked hard to improve people’s lives – her family, her friends and her community.

Born in Regina, she likely lay next to her future husband, Keith Reynolds, as an infant in the hospital nursery – they were born just days apart. She grew up with her younger brother, Blaine, in the small town of Southey, Sask., surrounded by family. Extended family was important throughout her life, especially when her parents separated in Sharlene’s teens, and she and Blaine were raised by a single mother with a lot less money.

To make a little extra cash, Sharlene would babysit for members of the Saskatchewan Roughriders.

At 17, she met Keith again at a political rally. He was immediately drawn to her, and over the next several months Keith won her over.

Sharlene graduated high school with a solid determination, after watching her mother struggle, that she would never be dependent on a man for money. She moved to Ottawa for her first year of undergrad at Carleton, then took a year off before returning to the University of Regina, where she got her BA in sociology.

She and Keith followed each other between cities and married in Ottawa in 1975. After a six-week honeymoon in Europe driving a VW camper van, they settled in the capital.

In 1976 she took a job doing constituency casework for an NDP member of Parliament. It was a good fit because she was determined that bureaucracy should not treat people unfairly. In the 1980s she became the federal NDP whip’s assistant. She found herding cats was a good analogy for managing MPs.

In 1983, when her daughter, Alexa, was born, Sharlene left the Hill. She spent a year working for an Ottawa councillor then left politics. She became a travel agent and then earned her certificate in teaching English as a second language. Her son, Matthew, was born a couple of years later and she became involved in their small school. Among other things, she fundraised to hire an artist in residence for the school.

When Keith took a job in Vancouver in 1993, the family followed. Here, she found her stride as a fundraiser while also earning a master’s degree in adult education remotely from St. Francis Xavier University. She worked for the Coast Foundation, which helps people with mental illnesses, and played a lead role in persuading several large organizations to fund the Courage to Come Back awards in B.C.

Story continues below advertisement

In 2007 she was offered her dream job as a fundraiser for an international aid organization in Ottawa but had to turn it down: She had recently been diagnosed with leukemia.

When doctors told Sharlene that she had six months to live, her family told the doctors Sharlene was tough as an old Prairie boot and she wasn’t going anywhere. Thanks to that Prairie toughness and medical good fortune, she lived another 13 years.

She never returned to the work force but that didn’t stop her. Sharlene became the spark plug for her community association, pushing for sensible planning and generally making herself a nuisance to elected officials.

When she was unable to walk longer distances, her family bought a travel wheelchair and toured museums in cities such as London and Berlin. Sharlene believed a parent’s job was to build memories.

Keith Reynolds is Sharlene’s husband.

My quarantine mornings begin with chopped strawberries. The dulling knife hits the wood below, rapping like raindrops, my hands sticky with juice. I break the berries into imperfect increments, toss them over yogurt into a bowl. I can’t tell if it’s today or yesterday. “They smell fresh,” I say out loud to no one. I live alone and I am talking to shadows.

“Tonight I’ve watched the moon and then the Pleiades go down; the night is now half-gone; youth goes; I am in bed alone,” reads a poem attributed often to Sappho. I recite it aloud and the quiet carries my whisper like a thunder crack. In the absence of touch these days, I feel a sizzle of electricity when a stranger brushes my hand by mistake. My weeks pass – at least, I think they do – in a dizzying abyss of absence. I look up and it is July. Really, what I’m saying is it’s been a long time since I’ve felt another heartbeat, since I’ve hugged a friend.

For years, my mailbox has taunted me. Most days I keep it closed, leaving the bills inside to gather dust because if there’s one thing I can count on in this world, it’s that they won’t stop coming. Some months I don’t open it at all. I do not need another reminder of my place in the precariat, never starker than when the mailbox’s jaws yawn open, chequeless. But in quarantine, I cast about for new kinds of exploration. Checking the mail becomes a ritual, a timepiece, the punctuation mark of my day.

Story continues below advertisement

I’ve never stayed in one place for so long as this, and like so many people, I feel most comfortable in some kind of motion. Quarantine is a lesson in forced stopping, in stasis and in letting go. I relinquish a plan I was holding tight, a trip through the geysers and glaciers of Yellowstone National Park with my best friends. A week in the wild has always felt to me like one long exhale, and here is one of the tiniest ways the virus is making it harder and harder to breathe. I let go of a dream I had, of a lover across the world flying home to stay. Now, my only journey is down concrete steps and out onto my stoop to find that everything means more and less than it once did. I’ve never been more and less in touch – the darkest irony – than these past weeks. I hear constantly from family and friends, but can’t reach out to press my hand up against theirs, can’t bury my face into a shoulder or a chest for temporary relief. I begin to look into my mailbox for connection, and am surprised at the whole world I find there.

When I was a child, my grandmother told me that if I held a conch shell up to my ear and listened closely, I’d hear the ocean. In the absence of sanity, I begin to listen to my mailbox tell me distant stories, too. Talismans begin to arrive. My brother leaves me a loaf of dense sourdough, its underside a thick, chalky black. The burn gives it personality, he says with a laugh. I slather it in butter and crunch my way through every hearty piece. It tells me there is more learning to be done, more living to do. A friend across the city mails me a painting, and when it arrives on a day I feel particularly weak and flutters softly to the ground, I cry a little when I see in bright paint the words: “strength (you are strong).” A friend I haven’t seen in years drops by on her bike with a novel aptly called The Door – where is it? And when can I slip through? – passing her much-loved copy on to me. Another friend tucks a newly sewn floral-printed mask inside my mailbox and nearly a hundred others all over town. Hers is the gift of movement, of safe passage. We commune with one another, new closeness I did not expect to find here. We are children again, holding tin cans at our windows, imagining we can hear through the twine that binds them.

When a booklet entitled “Simple Foraging in Southern Ontario” arrives from a friend in Ottawa, even the adventurer in me is sated for a little while. One sunny day, I take it with me to the park. I press my hands into the soil, cooler to the touch than human skin, and beneath my palms it almost feels like it is breathing. I carry home a fistful of ramps, wild leeks I foraged for the first time, and a cluster of dandelions. I tear off their young leaves for my salad, tracing the light outlines of hearts in the yellow powder they’ve left behind on my arms. Inside, I chop tomatoes and listen for a siren call of new adventure that hasn’t come, at least not yet. I sit on my stoop and watch the show the sky puts on each night, yearning for a future to pin my hopes on. My friends, falling in love despite quarantine or maybe because of it, shine like beacons as I bob in choppy waters a ways from proverbial shore. Touch is easy, I realize, and it’s care that’s hard. I take lessons from them, slowly. The sky looks especially bright tonight. Maybe there are wilds within us worth exploring.

It seems obvious to me now, in a way it always should have been, that what we pin our hopes on is each other.

There are times when you are tempted to believe that your shot at glory has come and gone, but what happens over the next few months will make it abundantly clear you are still in the game. Be ambitious, but don’t neglect your emotional and spiritual well-being.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

You will go further and faster over the next few days if you choose to use persuasion rather than coercion. Life does not have to be a battle – in fact, most people want to be on your side – so make allies instead of enemies. It could work wonders.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

Be careful that your imagination does not trick you into believing things that are clearly untrue. By all means look at all possibilities over the next few days but use a bit of common sense when deciding what is real and what is most likely fake news.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Keep your long-term goals in sight at all times. If you lose track of what’s going on, and what other people are doing in your name, it could get confusing. You may not be able to see around the next corner but you can see what’s up ahead.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

You will be in a dreamy sort of mood this week but you also need to be practical, especially when dealing with family situations that could easily get out of hand. Always think before you act and act only if you know what you are doing.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

Are you a lover or a fighter? Why not aim to be both? Your sign has a reputation for assertiveness, and sometimes you can be a bit aggressive too, but it will pay you to smooth over differences this week rather than blast your way through them.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

Everything is starting to fall into place and you may believe that you can do as you please. That may be true, for now, but be warned: if you act too high and mighty it could cause bad feeling that comes to the fore in the future.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

The cosmic powers that be are about to nudge you in a new direction and if you are smart you will happily go along for the ride. The less you resist the more opportunities you will get, not least because you won’t be wasting time arguing over nothing.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

This is a good time to go public with ideas you have been considering for some time. If others can see you have faith in your own abilities they will have faith in you too, making so much more possible. It’s your turn to shine Scorpio, so be a star!

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

You may not be aware of the fact but some very important people think highly of you, and if you play your cards right during the early part of this week your career could get a serious boost. Believe in yourself the way others believe in you.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

Now that both the sun and Mercury are moving through one of the most positive areas of your chart any doubts you had about the direction your life was taking should begin to fade. Happiness comes from knowing that what you do has meaning and purpose.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

You need to accept that friends and relatives won’t always see things the same way as you. You also need to accept that it’s not a personal insult when they disagree with you. Sometimes you seem to believe that your view is the only view, but it isn’t.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

You won’t need to be told when others are doing things that go against your interests – your sixth sense will warn you in plenty of time for you to take evasive action. Listen to what your inner voice tells you this week and act on it quickly and decisively.

Sarah Wiggins

I grew up in Barrie, Ont. My dad, born and raised in Jacmel, on Haiti’s south coast, played Tabou Combo cassettes in the car. My grandmother, who lived with us, boiled plantains and made mayi moulin, a Haitian-style polenta, for breakfast. Everyone in my house, including my Scottish-born mother, spoke Haitian Creole fluently. There was no doubt in my mind that I was Black.

At 18, when I moved to Toronto for college, I quickly realized that the grasp I had on my racial identity would be challenged. For the first time in my life, people asked me where I was from or, worse, “What are you?” At first, the questions seemed silly. Wasn’t it obvious? But over and over again people would point to my straight nose and fine hair and tell me I was not Black. Still, I certainly couldn’t claim to be white when at the time most drugstores didn’t carry my shade of foundation. So, what was I?

Without my family around as context, I felt the links to my Blackness dwindle. I felt racially ostracized and lost. I rarely spoke Creole or ate Haitian food. This feeling of otherness went on for a decade until I began actively looking for ways to reconnect with my Haitian heritage. I asked my father to lend me his Haitian cookbook in the hopes that among those recipes lay the key to feeling that family connection. As it turned out, while I struggled to master childhood dishes, it would be learning about my Scottish heritage that would prove most fruitful in my quest to understand myself.

I met my husband, Daniel, through an online dating site where I used the moniker Voodoo Haggis. When prompted for a sobriquet upon signing up for the site, a nickname from a co-worker popped into my head and just felt right. Both voodoo as a religion and haggis as a food are misunderstood elements of my dual heritage that people have strong reactions toward but seldom know much about. I wanted to pique someone’s curiosity and invite them onto this journey with me.

Daniel is a chef who grew up in a Scottish household. He spoke about fond memories of eating haggis on Robbie Burns Day and I was both intrigued and ashamed. Even though I was half Scottish, I had never heard of Burns, the famed Scottish poet. Nor had I heard about Hogmanay, the annual New Year’s feast featuring potato scones, Scotch eggs and bridies, delicious hand-held meat pastries I would come to love.

Dating Daniel served as a primer on all things Scottish and the more I learned, the more I saw parallels between Haitian and Scottish traditions. Hogmanay and Haitian Independence Day, for example, are food-heavy celebrations that occur on Jan. 1. While the former is about the arrival of the winter solstice and the end of yule, the latter honours the slave revolt that culminated in Haiti becoming the first Black republic to gain its independence. It is cathartic to know that on the first day of the year, the two halves of my family are whole and feasting in celebration.

Sarah Wiggins

After a year together, Daniel and I began a communal dinner series that would morph into a monthly supper club. In May, 2013 we hosted our first three-course Haitian and Scottish fusion dinner for 25 strangers; the event was called Voodoo Haggis. Because both cuisines are nose-to-tail, the combinations of rich flavours and tangy notes worked together beautifully. The menu read like a love letter to myself. Hickory-smoked haddock with Haitian-style cabbage pikliz (pickled slaw) and fried plantain. Citrus-marinated braised pork shoulder (known as griot) with haggis and mayi moulin. Lavender-lemon scones with clotted cream and coconut tablet cocoyé, a coconut sugar disk.

During one dinner last year, we shared stories about Haiti and Scotland as a way to demystify the two countries and reveal their intersections. Guests were curious about how the food pairings and histories would intermingle, so we discussed the ways peasant and working-class life influenced food culture in both lands. For example, many Haitian households experience rolling blackouts; due to the lack of consistent refrigeration, they rely on daily trips to the market and the heavy use of vinegar and lemon in meat preparation. In Scotland, haggis is an inexpensive dish made of ingredients available in most homes (oats, onions, spices and dried fruit) combined with offal. In earlier centuries, the sheep’s stomach served both as a sac to keep off-cuts fresh on the journey home after a hunt and as a temporary casing for cooking the ingredients once they were minced and mixed together. Two countries that seem to have so little in common were explored as one – and I finally felt whole, seen and understood.

As Canada takes steps to reopen, I plan to resume these dinners, galvanized by the groundswell of racial activism that has taken hold. I want to continue to encourage people to tell their stories, to listen and learn from each other. The key to justice is through empathy and understanding. Where better to find that than across a table, where food has the power to unite.

If you want to get ahead over the coming year then you must use your head. Others can rush blindly here, there and everywhere, but your time and energy are precious and must be used sparingly. The more brain power you use the more of a winner you’ll be.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

It’s time to put your affairs in order, especially the kind of little things that you usually ignore or leave to other people. Anything of a routine or mundane nature will be easy to deal with this weekend, so get busy and get it done.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

You have been paying too much attention to what other people say is good for you and not enough to what, deep down, you know is good for you – and they are very different things. Listen to your inner voice, then act on it swiftly and decisively.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

If you are asked to help out loved ones and friends this weekend just drop what you are doing and put their needs first. The more you do for others now the more the universe will do for you in a few weeks’ time. Being nice is good business.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

There will be a great many ideas buzzing around your brain over the next 48 hours and you are strongly advised to note them down as and when they arrive. If you don’t, you may find that less important matters crowd them out and make you forget.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

Business activities of all kinds are under very good stars at the moment, so if there is something you want to create, something you think could make you a lot of money further down the line, get on with it straight away. The time to act is NOW.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

The sun joins your ruling planet Mercury in your sign today, making this a fantastic time of year to focus on your life’s goals. Aim to be the very best Virgo you can be, both in your personal affairs and in your career – then make it happen.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

Stop making such a big deal of the many things you cannot control, and focus instead on the few things you can control. At this time of year there is a danger you could feel overwhelmed by life, but you’ve still got a thousand reasons to smile.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

Everyone seem amazingly friendly toward you all of a sudden and, being a Scorpio, that is sure to make you suspicious. There’s really no need. The cosmic picture is changing rapidly and your luck is changing with it, with relationships going especially well.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

People in positions of authority will take a liking to you over the next few days and it’s quite possible you will be invited to take on more responsibility. That’s great, but make sure you get paid a decent rate for it. Your dollar value has increased!

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

If you have been thinking about getting away from your usual environment then start making concrete plans. The sun in your fellow earth sign of Virgo over the next few weeks will inspire you to be more adventurous. It’s time to get moving.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

If you are asked to get involved in some kind of plan or project this weekend you must be 100 per cent sure it’s the right thing for you before you commit yourself. Give it some serious thought, because there could be financial consequences.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

A person with severe mental illness is considered the ultimate unreliable narrator.

She tells you a story about a horrible thing that happened to her, and you ask:

Story continues below advertisement

“Yes, but did this actually happen? Are you sure you remember correctly?” “Yes, but what did you do to provoke this?” ”Yes, but were you not a threat to other people?“ ”Yes, but you were sick, you deserved this treatment.”

In June of 2008, I graduated as valedictorian of a well-known Toronto private school. I was ambitious, highly motivated and excited for my future.

A year later, I would be experiencing my first episode of psychosis, admitted into St. Michael’s Hospital Emergency Room. I would spend the next four years going in and out of psychiatric wards in states of serious mania and psychosis.

The thing you have to remember about a person experiencing psychosis is that they do not interpret their surroundings in a normal way: in my episodes during these years, all things and people around me became metaphors. Police officers or paramedics or hospital security guards were not just people to me: they represented force, harm and danger.

At those times in my life I was suffering from an undiagnosed eating disorder, purposefully starving myself. During my hospitalizations, I was very weak and underweight. I was never a violent patient: a little stubborn and eccentric, maybe, but mostly just terrified, not in any kind of position to do anyone any harm. So when the men in uniform grabbed me, or slammed me against a wall, wrestling me to the floor, in my delusional state, they were not just hurting me, they were killing me. I screamed out for my brother to come save me. It was not just a little jostling: in those moments, it felt very much like my life was coming to an end.

When it comes to violence by authority figures, public conversation in this moment in time is revolving specifically around wellness checks by police. But in my mind, speaking from my experiences, this is just the tip of the iceberg. We have seen video footage of the bottom of the Mariana Trench and the surface of Mars, but the general public is totally unaware of what goes on inside the locked doors of Toronto psych wards: news cameras are not allowed on these floors, and patients are not allowed to record on their phones. As a result, the general public does not see how much violence is done against psych ward patients.

In my day-to-day experience, I haven’t met any activists talking about violence against the mentally ill, because most people experiencing psychosis-related violence are not in a position to speak up. Many of them are mentally unable to advocate for themselves, and many of them live with too much shame to share their story: after all, who wants to broadcast to the world that their mental illness was so bad the cops had to do a wellness check? Who wants to broadcast to the world that they spent time in a psych ward?

Story continues below advertisement

Instead, if we are lucky enough to have caring family around us, we hide out in their spare bedrooms, unemployed, stewing in our shame, carrying not only the trauma of our illness but then also the trauma inflicted on us by authorities during our hospitalizations. Some become homeless. Some take their own life.

My story is unusual: I come from a privileged white family, was able to complete my education, and was trained from a very young age to transform all my trauma and emotional energy into art. Since my last hospitalization for mania in 2012, I have gone on to a successful career as a film director, and am well-supported by my community. I currently live a mentally stable life, enjoy the company of many wonderful friends, and look forward to continuing my journey as a filmmaker and storyteller until I am a very, very old woman.

Regis Korchinski-Paquet will never have these opportunities. Nor will Chantel Moore, nor will Ejaz Choudry. I can picture the scenes of their wellness checks: their fear of authorities maybe amplified by their experiences as people of colour. People experiencing mental illness may demonstrate erratic behaviour; they may move suddenly, they may shout. But I can tell you that they are often full of terror, scared of pain and scared of dying. The image of a police officer – often a big white man with a gun – is interpreted as a threat, an agent of death, an oppressor.

The police officers I encountered in all my various hospitalizations never shot me. They never even pulled out a gun. They may occasionally pull a gun when encountering white people in crisis, but it appears from the statistics that they are much more likely to pull a gun if a person in crisis is not white. Those who do not speak English as a first language are also at a significant disadvantage. I may well have been just as sick as each of these three people I mentioned above at the times of my wellness check, but here I am today, alive, typing out an essay.

Echoing CAMH’s statement as reported June 23, the best person to help a person in crisis, a person like my 18-year-old self or like Regis Korchinski-Paquet or Chantel Moore or Ejaz Choudry, is someone who has had proper training in crisis care. That could be a nurse, a social worker, or a specialized de-escalation team who can use non-violent tactics when caring for the patient. Translators are sometimes needed. Police officers are not trained properly for these kinds of emergencies, and they are not the right people to respond to these calls.

Not all people living with mental illness know the history of their community. Throughout history, members of the community of people living with mental illness have been murdered, tortured, discriminated against. Black and Indigenous communities and those whose first language is not English have been disproportionately affected, and members of their communities continue to be killed because of their illness.

It would be great if we could move beyond the one day each year of corporate-sponsored mental health conversations and start more focused, year-long conversations about the reality of being sick, and each person’s right to safety and wellness, even in the thick of a serious episode."

Rely on no one’s judgment but your own over the coming year. You already know what it is you should be doing with your life, so don’t let others confuse you with their conflicting ideas. Trust your inner voice, and act on what it tells you with passion.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

You may not be one for doing the daily chores but you will be expected to chip in and do your fair share today. Some of it may be mind-numbingly boring but help out with a smile on your face anyway. The universe will reward you for it.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

You have a reputation for being sensible and practical – predictable even – but over the next few days you will get the chance to change that. If an opportunity to do something dramatic and daring comes your way don’t avoid it, embrace it!

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Ultimately we all create our own “luck” in life by the thoughts and feelings we allow to guide us, so if something has not worked out the way you expected try questioning your own attitude. A more positive outlook could lead to beneficial changes.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

The pace of life will pick up over the next few days, so get both your body and your mind ready to step up a gear. Don’t worry if you feel tired or jaded, because once you start moving your energy levels will soar – and so will you.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

If something seems to be stuck you should stop trying to move it and focus on something else for a while. Sometimes even a Leo finds it difficult to get ahead through force of personality, so give yourself a break and let the universe do it for you.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

You have so much to look forward to and there are so many new opportunities coming your way. So why are you still hung up on the past? Draw a mental line in the sand and refuse to allow your thoughts to go back across it. Never look back.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

Something that seemed so difficult to deal with yesterday will be the easiest thing in the world to resolve today. The issue itself may be exactly the same as before but your mind will shift so you can see it in a more positive light.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

If you find yourself at odds with someone in a position of authority you are strongly advised to let them have the last word. Even if you are convinced they don’t know what they are talking about it will pay you to back off a bit. Think strategically.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

No, you are not at the mercy of events, although if you allow yourself to think that way it may appear to you as if you are. Always believe you are master of your fate, or at least act that way even if your mind still doesn’t quite “get it”.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

If you expect the best today you will surely get it, of that there is no doubt at all. As the cosmic picture begins to change in your favor the events you experience will align themselves more with your thoughts, so think well of yourself.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

The world is full of opportunities, so why are you so reluctant to act? Maybe it’s because you have allowed yourself to sink into a negative frame of mind, the kind where you cannot see meaning in anything. Snap out of it – meaning is what you make of it!

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

Be smart and let a trusted friend or relative in on your thoughts today. With luck they will ease your fears and help you understand that you don’t have to face life’s trials and tribulations on your own. Your strength is in your togetherness.

Audrey Vincent Rockingham Gill: Mother. Journalist. Public servant. Powerhouse. Born Jan. 15, 1937, in Victoria; died Jan. 18, 2020, in Vancouver, of complications due to Alzheimer’s, aged 83.

When her father returned home from the Second World War a decorated hero, he found that his eight-year-old daughter Audrey commanded the household. She held sway over her gentle younger brother and her demure mother. The confidence and conviction that would define her as an adult were already powerfully formed.

She graduated high school in Vancouver at the young age of 15. This was fortunate, as her father, as an acknowledgement of his military leadership in Korea, had been invited to London and Audrey was presented as a debutante to the new Queen Elizabeth. After returning, she graduated with a double major in history and political science from McGill University. It was in Montreal where she met and fell in love with John Gill of Ottawa, who at the time was a bush pilot and piano player. They married in 1960.

Story continues below advertisement

Until she was eight months pregnant with her first child, Audrey reported for the Financial Post when it was rare for a woman to be in the parliamentary press gallery. After a second child was born, she became a freelance journalist and began a lifelong love of magazines, which would lead to her founding three over her career.

She was an unconventional mother for her era. Alexandra and Peter remember the rat-a-tat of her electric typewriter from behind her office door while they watched TV. Audrey taught through trust, example and expectation. Her children were expected to use their sound judgment and make responsible choices themselves. In keeping with her love of the arts, she never quashed her daughter’s disorderly creative nature. Although Alex’s clothes and hair struck all manner of chaotic arrangements, she doesn’t recall her mother once remarking on either. Independence and critical thinking were among the highest virtues.

Audrey was hired by the Liberal Party in 1975 and rose to be director of policy development. She excelled at making real the visions of others, in part thanks to her great social energy and sense of fun. She did not just love the Liberal Party, she loved parties in general. Nowhere did the two come together better than during her beloved Grindstone Group weekend, which lasted 40 years, a round table gab-fest about policy by day with noisy political kibitzing by night.

Her children rarely saw her as happy as during the 1976 and 1980 election night celebrations for Liberal majorities at Ottawa’s Château Laurier.

Peter and Alex grew up knowing their mother was special, but they were not sure why. They were too young to appreciate that her intellectual curiosity, high spiritedness and toughness made her a force in her professional life where she worked to advance social justice and liberal values. This was true even after she and John divorced and Audrey moved to Toronto in 1984 to become a consultant in the private sector.

During her years in the east, Audrey always longed to return to “my West Coast.” Back in Vancouver, she used to say these were her favourite years of motherhood, when her children were adults and they could spend long hours in conversation with her. But she was a private person and did not gossip. Discussions were about ideas, Canadian politics, world affairs and the several organizations she helped to found once she “retired.”

Audrey died as she lived – on her own terms and displaying astonishing strength of character. She was a formidable person, and a public servant and mother of unsentimental yet tremendous heart.

I’m seven years old and I can’t sleep; a woman’s screams are lifting from the vents in my bedroom floor.

Gingerly, I make my way downstairs, and to my relief, the shrieks aren’t coming from my mother. On our two-foot-deep television, my oldest brother is watching a teenaged girl try to evade a man in a striped sweater. Beneath a fedora, the man’s face is a mess of sores the likes of which I’ve never seen (and shouldn’t be seeing at an age as tender as his skin). My brother, with his back to me, has no idea I’m in the room. Fright-stricken, I tiptoe back to my bedroom. There, I live out the first of many nightmares in which Freddy Krueger fillets me. My pledge is obvious: to stay as far away from horror movies as I can.

That year, 1995, my parents separate, and something comes over me. I watch Stephen King’s It, John Carpenter’s Halloween, and Frank Marshall’s Arachnophobia. Fear sticks to me like blood on bedsheets, but I can’t get enough. Remorseful for disrupting our familial foundation – and eager to please us – my father permits my brothers and me to rent whatever R-rated movies we want. Every other Sunday, when I return from a weekend at his house, I beg my mother to allow us the same liberty: “ … but Dad lets us watch them. I’m not scared!” Irritated, she shuts me down. It’s just as well. She knows Pet Sematary chilled me dry.

Soon after my parents’ divorce, my oldest brother takes up partying. He hoards heaps of garbage under his bed, and he nearly sets the house on fire. He racks up more than $900 in long-distance phone calls to his internet girlfriend. After watching An American Werewolf in London, he torments my middle brother and me. As we settle into our sleeping bags on the floor of my dad’s studio apartment, he tells us to stay awake: “Dad’s going to turn into a werewolf and eat you up.” For all I know, he could be right. Everything else is changing.

My mother, dealing with insufficient child support and the emotional instability of my middle brother, whose Tourette's syndrome is being expressed as rage attacks, can’t cope. She kicks my oldest brother out of the house, a decision that will haunt her for decades. He moves in with a friend, and then with my dad. Eight years old and presumably also affected by the divorce (though I didn’t know it), I’m placed in therapy. My therapist belittles me with puppet-show tactics. She employs a matted stuffed sheep named Lamb Chops. Lamb Chops speaks to me like I’m four years old, and all I can think of is my father barking at the moon and biting this thing’s head off.

By the time my middle brother is in his second year of high school, his anxiety is so aggressive he has to drop out. Having the short end of the custody stick, my father doesn’t know how to help, nor does he understand the breadth of the issue. His interactions with us become surface-level: How are things? Good. You’re going through a hard time. I know. Keep your chin up.

Over the next few years, we fall into a routine, filling periods of awkward silence with my father by frequenting the Video Zone and, unsurprisingly, all is well again – at least for a few hours. My brothers and I pace the horror section, marvelling at the gruesome artwork. My dad places a hand on my shoulder, and a buzzing sound bridges the gap between us as I zip my fingernail across Jack Frost’s holographic cover.

Slashers slash. Zombies bite. Creatures ooze and demons rise. I stay awake at night, scared to the core but hungry for more. After we finish Halloween 4 and he flicks off the TV, I ask my father a seemingly harmless question: “Why did you and Mom have to split up?” For the first time in my life, I witness my father cry.

Soon enough, my oldest brother moves out and is no longer present at my father’s when we visit. But the horror films continue, as do the resulting discussions when we occasionally speak on the phone. There’s a disconnect, with eight years between us and him now living three hours away, and a near-decade passes in which he isn’t prevalent in my life. But when we see each other – me being a teenager at this point, and more versed in horror culture than ever – we talk horror movies and books and it’s like he’s never left.

Shortly before my father left my mother, they got into a fight. I tiptoed downstairs, much like I would a few weeks later to discover A Nightmare on Elm Street. My oldest brother must’ve been out with his friends, because it was in his wall that my dad punched a hole, breaking his hand in the process. And it’s in his room that I saw my first Stephen King book, sitting on a ledge dividing the walls. There, Carrie White was inked in more blood than I thought possible to exist in all life on Earth. A smattering of drywall dust speckled her prom dress.

It’s been 25 years since my parents separated, and I like to think the men in my family are closer than ever – but, like Patrick Bateman’s convincing demeanour, what’s on the surface doesn’t always mirror what’s beneath. We still can’t express ourselves as deeply as we’d like. Formal pleasantries are still a barrier, particularly for my father. We’ve made breakthroughs, though, and sometimes I’m convinced we don’t need to verbally acknowledge our affection. Sometimes, just being together is enough. Gifting one another cheap-thrill novels over the holidays is enough. As rare as it is, sitting down to watch a scary movie with my father is enough. Saying “I love you” to him but also meaning “Everything worked out fine in the end. Don’t beat yourself up” is enough. Sharing a passion for buckets of blood – rivaled only by buckets of popcorn – is enough, even if it brings us together as haphazardly as Leatherface’s needlework. And, when the credits roll, I think that’s enough for me.

Fashion follows a predictable rhythm. Designers design, factories fill orders, new collections hit stores, magazines appear on shelves – all like clockwork. But once the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the industry’s steady tempo became erratic. Seven months after the virus reached North America, not only has the way many of us shop changed, but the back end of the business has been shaken up like never before.

For some in the industry, the pandemic presented an opportunity to pursue reform. In May, designers including Dries Van Noten, Erdem Moralioglu and Gucci’s Alessandro Michele all signed an open letter in favour of slowing down and producing less. For others, it forced workplace revamps, catalyzed the creation of charitable initiatives or revealed the shortcomings of the traditional retail model. In June, the renewed urgency of the Black Lives Matter movement pressured fashion to reckon with its racial inequity.

To take stock of exactly how much things have changed, we asked Canadians who work in fashion to share how they’ve navigated this disruption and where they go from here.

Fashion often works seasons or even years in advance. But as the pandemic began in early 2020, the timeline that keeps the industry on track went haywire as stores and factories closed.

Tanya Taylor (designer): We sell to a lot of major retailers – Saks, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, ShopBop, Bergdorf’s – and we immediately jumped on a call with them and started asking about their store closing policy and what their contingency plan around inventory would look like. We tried to cut anything that hadn’t been made yet, to reduce our inventory to save costs. We cancelled 16 events that we had planned between March and the end of May.

Richard Simons (owner and VP of buying, Simons): Restructuring our inventory and deliveries was key. Our planning and forecasting models were redesigned and updated weekly in a crisis that was changing daily. To be honest, it felt a bit like navigating through the fog. I remember several times making decisions in the morning and reversing them in the afternoon as we received new information. In normal times, managers that change their minds so often would be fired.

Catherine Addai (designer and boutique owner, Kaela Kay): We ended up putting out a call on Instagram, asking our customers, “Do you want us to launch a collection? Do you want to see something new right now? What’s happening in your life?” We don’t want to come across as insensitive and just about the money. And, thankfully, the feedback we got from literally everybody was like, no, we want to see [new things] even if we don’t shop.

The fashion industry’s community response to the pandemic ranged from global conglomerates such as LVMH retasking its perfume factories to manufacture hand-sanitizing gel to Canadian brands including Smythe and Canada Goose creating masks and hospital scrubs to ease the pressure on personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies.

Rami Helali (CEO, Kotn): It’s always important to be conscious of how people are feeling and understand that there are times when people aren’t in the head space to shop. We tried to focus on the positives that were happening throughout the world. We did a pay-it-forward campaign. We had excess inventory and rather than just discount it, we let our customers gift it to any front-line worker they wanted to give to, for free.

Lesley Hampton (designer): We shifted to making cloth masks. We partnered with a company called CoverGalls to collaborate with them to develop masks. We did 200. The Canadian Arts and Fashion Awards have an online presence supporting Canadian designers and partnered with Fashion magazine to put on a sale event to assist designers in selling our work as much as we could. [Editor’s note: According to organizers, the two-day initiative resulted in $130,000 in sales for participating designers].

Jennifer Wong (president & COO, Aritzia): We created the Aritzia Community Care Program, which is a $20-million initiative to donate custom-developed clothing packages to front-line health-care workers fighting COVID-19 in Canada and the U.S. PPE isn’t our specialty but high-quality clothing is, so we knew this was a way we could help.

Aurora James (designer, Brother Vellies): [To support the activism around Black Lives Matter] I had the idea of the 15% Pledge, an initiative to ensure 15 per cent of products available in stores come from Black producers and things moved very quickly. We became a non-profit and signed Sephora to the Pledge as our first major retailer. As a business owner, I have been especially torn up by how much Black businesses were suffering [during the pandemic]. This pledge is one way major retailers can take steps toward financial equality.

Creative collaboration is at the core of how fashion entices us to shop but that process had to be completely reimagined for a remote world. For the June cover of GQ, actor Robert Pattinson photographed himself at his London apartment while other titles including Vanity Fair and Vogue took to Zoom and FaceTime to capture their subjects. That sort of unprecedented flexibility crossed over to the boardroom as designers and retailers reached out to their competitors to figure out how to navigate a new normal.

Bernadette Morra (editor-in-chief, Fashion): After lockdown began, any original art that we had to produce suddenly became very problematic. We had a cover story, which was going to involve flying a crew down to Austin, Tex., to photograph Antoni Porowski from Queer Eye. We had to do it all remotely. George Antonopoulos, our creative and fashion director, first had all the clothing shipped to his own condo in Toronto. He styled it out the way he wanted Antoni to wear it, photographed everything, repacked it, sent it down. Antoni had to steam and iron and do all the things a stylist would normally do. We thought that we would be able to get Antoni to shoot himself on his iPhone but that didn’t work out. We ended up hiring a photographer in Austin, and she shot him outside and from afar. For cover shoots, you usually have lots of lighting and a digital technician who’s looking at the images right away and advising on different technical aspects of the shoot. There was none of that.

Jon Hennessey (makeup artist and owner of Nobasura artist management): We’re seeing certain clients we work with from an e-commerce perspective that are shipping products to influencers or to models to shoot in their own environments. That’s something that’s new. And the results are there’s a lot of beautiful content that’s being created.

Conor Cunningham (photographer): A couple of weeks into lockdown, I was starting to get a little stir-crazy and I saw people were doing FaceTime shoots. I thought, I guess if I could make it look like it wasn’t through FaceTime, if I could find a way to produce work that looked like what I would normally do, I would give it a shot. Now, I’ve been able to book shoots with people that I normally would have to travel to do anything with. And it’s opened the door to work with brands that may not have been able to afford to fly me out somewhere.

Taylor: This has been a moment where a traditionally private and sometimes protective industry where brands don’t share their secrets has really opened up. Within the first month of lockdown, the conversations that I was invited to have with other CEOs of companies that are our competitors are conversations I would have never been able to have before. It was a really collaborative brainstorming around how we change the calendar, how we change our relationships with wholesalers.

As the industry planned its restart, brands and creative talent diverged on how to respond to some key questions. Is this the end of seasonal fads? How do you make things such as fashion shows and photo shoots as safe as possible? Should you tweak your collection to cater to a more home-focused lifestyle? And what is the future of physical stores?

Vanessa Craft (editor-in-chief, Elle Canada): For a long time, we have been talking as a team about the relevancy of things like trend reports. This industry is obviously a beast that constantly needs feeding. And now, there is a reckoning that is happening. And that is a very positive thing in terms of everyone in the industry looking at what is our responsibility here. Going into September, the thing that is on most people’s minds in the magazine industry is what is the reality of clothing? What are designers doing right now? Just from a logistical point of view, is there anything that we would want to photograph? And if so, has it even been produced? Then the next thing, of course, that we’re focused on is what is a relevant and helpful conversation to be having with fashion right now. You know, this constant need to have new things. There needs to be conversations around sustainability.

Hennessey: As a makeup artist, we can’t have the model in the chair wearing a mask while we’re doing their makeup. So it’s on the artists themselves to take on that responsibility: wearing masks, gloves, sanitizing surfaces. We’re streamlining kits down to just essential elements so that they’re easier to maintain. We also connected with a company called Beauty So Clean, which is in Toronto, and they provide products for cosmetic sanitation. So it’s taking a lot of those things that you do behind the scenes and making it part of our protocol to do them in front of the client.

Hampton: We as a brand have our evening wear collection, but we also have an athleisure line. Moving forward, we’re going to focus more on the athleisure collection, mostly because everyone has gotten used to work-from-home outfits. Even if people re-enter the workspace, they’re going to want something comfortable. And the gala events may not return in the next year.

Helali: A lot of retailers rely on the uptick of sales around the holidays, and I think many of us aren’t sure if that’s going to exist this year. People are trying to hedge their decisions with both inventory and new store openings. We had a handful of new store openings that have been put on pause for now, just until we have a little more visibility of what’s coming. We feel very strongly that physical retail is part of our road map, it’s just about timing.

As stores reopen and in-person runway shows begin for the Spring 2021 season in cities such as London and Paris, many in the industry are wondering if the new road map was actually just a temporary detour. For real change to take hold, the digital surge, more streamlined collections and a sustained focus on inclusiveness will have to become the norm beyond the pandemic.

Morra: The breakdown of the wholesale model is being accelerated. The power of the big department store just no longer exists. In the last few years, we’ve seen the rise of a lot of brands that are ignoring wholesale altogether and doing direct to consumer. And so that is something that I think is going to accelerate. Anybody who wasn’t making e-commerce a priority definitely is now.

Simons: The industry is now acknowledging some major issues that need to change, such as too many collections being presented throughout the fashion calendar, excessive travel by the industry at large and overproduction of garments leading to mass discounting and markdowns. I am confident many of these problems will be resolved through the use of technology, such as new platforms to manage inventories and decrease supply. In a way, COVID-19 has simply been the accelerator of change that is greatly needed.

Craft: The biggest changes will come from not only the logistics or the practicalities of the fashion calendar and shopping and when collections hit the stores. I think we also cannot keep having these elitist conversations that only cater to a certain audience and cut out a significant portion of the population who are just as deserving of the magic of fashion as anybody else. I’m hoping that everyone in the industry can keep having uncomfortable conversations and face up to the need for authentically diverse voices. It’s better for storytelling. It’s better for creativity.

Jose De Sousa’s childhood home in Caracas, Venezuela, boasted a large backyard garden filled with vibrant flowers. It was his mother’s pride and joy – so much so that all the care she put into tending it left him jealous and even bitter. When it would bloom, she would take pictures of De Sousa and his sister in front of all the plants.

“She’d always end up trying so hard to fit so much of the garden in the pictures that we would end up out of the frame,” he says. “We would get so upset when the photos came back.”

Twenty years later and living in Montreal with his own family, De Sousa finally understands why his mother was such a fanatic. He has discovered gardening to be meditative and fulfilling, bringing him peace whether weeding or harvesting.

Unfortunately, outdoors he only has access to a small patch of grass. While he was able to grow herbs and small plants, he was craving more. So when De Sousa saw how well a colleague’s Click & Grow smart gardening system was performing in their poorly lit office, he decided to buy one for his home. It was a success, from piri-piri peppers to a painted nettle plant.

“I placed my system near my dining room and it feels like a beautiful centrepiece in my home,” he says of the Smart Garden indoor container. “Whenever I’m cooking, I have the pleasure to take a few steps and pick some fresh cilantro or basil and add it into my meal. It’s a beautiful part of my day.”

In this era of the smart home, it’s no surprise that gardeners – particularly those who live without a backyard or even a balcony – are cultivating a digital green thumb. Sleek systems that wouldn’t look out of place in Apple stores, such as the AVA, Click & Grow and AeroGarden, allow people to water, light and monitor their plants with the press of a button, whether they are at their kitchen table or out of town.

When Canadian startup AVA Technologies launched its US$400 gardening system this year, the first batch of preorders sold out in just a few weeks. Called the Byte, it works with soil-free plant “pods,” similar to Nespresso pods, that are available preseeded or customizable. Each comes with a scannable QR code that tells the machine what is being planted, and the water and LED lighting levels are adjusted accordingly. It can hold up to four weeks of water and has a built-in monitoring system and camera that allows users to keep watch from wherever they are – and even water the plants through their phone.

The target market is people, particularly millennials, in search of a savvy solution for small spaces with minimal natural light. “We realized that there was a huge need for being able to grow at the comfort of your own home, even if you don’t have a lot of space,” says Valerie Song, CEO and co-founder of AVA Technologies. “You should still be able to have the option of growing beautiful, luscious green plants that you can eat or just enjoy the sight of.”

When Sharon Menelaoui downsized recently from a townhouse to a condo in Toronto, the toughest adjustment was getting used to the limited space on her balcony after saying goodbye to a spacious backyard garden.

“It’s really hard to figure out what you can plant outside on the balcony garden due to the issue of wind tunnels around buildings. They have to be resilient enough,” she says.

Menelaoui came across the Click and Grow system – starting at US$100 – in a magazine during the height of COVID and felt inspired to make the purchase. “It was as easy as just plugging it in. Within three weeks, I had a bunch of basil to cook with. You just have to watch the water intake and it keeps growing.”

Simplicity has its benefits, but for many gardeners it’s the patience, endurance and tactility involved that makes the activity so rewarding. Gardening engages all of the senses and fosters the ability to adapt to change and failure. Technological gardens, on the other hand, are created to be successful.

Which is why Cheney Creamer, a horticultural therapy specialist based in Burnaby, B.C., says such systems aren’t as emotionally fulfilling as outdoor gardens.

“These types of products often have claims like, ‘perfectly designed,’ or, ‘perfectly calibrated to replicate nature.’ Every time I read that, I think that these people haven’t maybe met very many plants or haven’t been out in nature,” she says.

While there may be less work involved in maintaining her smart garden, Menelaoui says she simply enjoys the sight of a healthy and flourishing plant in her home.

“I just love being able to see that luscious and natural burst of green in my home all the time. I’m really looking forward to the winter because I’m sure it’s going to be such a wonderful sight to have something growing in my house when everything outside is so dead and dreary.”

Indeed, research has shown that any level of engagement with nature is positive. It’s why Creamer named her wellness consulting organization One Green Square, after psychological studies proved that even looking at the colour green can promote creativity and problem solving. And it’s why, despite her hesitations, she thinks these systems could be a way to get more individuals interested in gardening.

“I absolutely believe that there is a place for these smart gardens, especially for those with accessibility issues. All interactions with nature have therapeutic benefits,” she says. “But I see these devices as gateway gardens, like a gateway drug. If you know someone who doesn’t really have any interest in plants or gardening, I think this might be a fun and easy way to pique their interest.”

The first thought that comes into your head will more often than not be the best thought, so trust your instincts and don’t listen to those who call themselves “experts” but don’t seem to know what they are talking about. The only expert advice you need is your own.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

Just because you can take what you want does not mean you have to take it, nor does it make it the right thing to do. Your “me first” attitude can be a plus in some situations but it could be a minus today, so be more cautious than usual.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

A friend or family member is feeling a bit down and needs cheering up, and you are just the person to help them see there is still plenty to smile about. Just make sure that their worries and woes don’t start bringing you down too!

Story continues below advertisement

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Yes, it might be wiser to keep certain opinions to yourself, but since when have you allowed other people’s disapproval to stop you speaking your mind? Say what you feel has to be said today and deal with negative reactions by ignoring them.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

Not everyone possesses your creative flair, so make allowances for those whose efforts fall short of what you were expecting of them. Also, if everyone was as passionate and productive as you then you wouldn’t stand out from the crowd so much.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

You seem to be having second thoughts about a venture that you were red hot for just a short time ago, and most likely it’s because you are listening to those who say you are aiming too high. Ignore them. You’re a Leo, and Leos always go higher.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

It’s time to put the past behind you and venture forth into a brave new future. Mercury, your ruler, moves into your sign today and the sun also enters your sign at the weekend – which simply means that brave new future is about to begin.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

Usually you cannot be bothered to respond to criticism, but what someone has been saying about you must be answered, because if you don’t speak up in your own defence some people might start believing the accusations are true – and they’re not!

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

Cosmic activity in and around the friendship area of your chart means you need to come out of your shell and interact more with the world around you. You have been far too defensive of late, so start believing in yourself again, and believe in other people too.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

You seem to be in one of those moods where you feel the only way to reach your goals is to tear everything down and start again from scratch. On the work front there may be some truth in that, but avoid making unnecessary changes in your private life.

Story continues below advertisement

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

You don’t need to cut corners or bend the rules, not when you have everything going for you already. The next few days will see a number of situations move in your favor. That’s a sign you are on the right track and don’t need to change a thing.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

The more certain individuals say you can trust them the more suspicious you should be. The planets warn that something is about to change in a very big way and because others know that they may try to take advantage of your uncertainty. Question everything.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

Communications planet Mercury moves into the partnership area of your chart today, so you should find it easier to get your message across. But don’t forget that messages flow in both directions, which means you also need to keep your eyes and ears open.

“Welcome to hell, ladies,” he says in an Eastern European accent. I grimace as he presses down on my stiff upper back, attempting to coax out an extra millimetre of flexibility. I’m finally ticking adult ballet class off my bucket list, but now I’m wondering what possessed me to do this.

When I was a little girl in the 60s, I begged my mother to let me take ballet class. I loved the pink tutus, the pretty buns, the dreams of gracefully dancing across the stage like the Swan Princess. She sent me off to figure skating and Brownies and yet, for some reason that’s still a mystery to me, she wouldn’t budge on ballet lessons.

With the distractions of teenagehood and then the demands of adult life, thoughts of taking ballet lessons were put on hold. But every so often, usually while watching an inspired performance of Swan Lake, those little pangs of unfulfilled desire would speak up and say: You should take lessons before it’s too late.

And here I am – more than 50 years after pleading with my mother – finally taking the plunge.

The class is called Absolute Beginner Adult Ballet, and I’m a good 30 years older than the rest of the participants. Our instructor (Mr. C) is trained in classical Russian ballet and has had an illustrious dancing career.

I’ve got my hair in a slicked-back bun and I’m wearing second-hand pink ballet slippers. Sadly, the tutu-wearing window has closed for me.

We start with warm-up exercises. The precise, controlled movements are so different from what I’m used to in my regular aerobics and strength training classes. I’m in pretty good shape, but this warm-up is killing me. Based on the groans, my younger classmates are faring no better. “Did I tell you to stop? Keep going, ladies,” says Mr. C with a devilish grin, revelling in our agony.

This brings me a disturbing flashback to elementary school gym class in suburban Montreal. For years, I had an evil gym teacher who hailed from somewhere in the former Soviet bloc. He delighted in beaning timid little girls with dodgeballs and mocking our feeble attempts at hoisting our scrawny bodies up on chin-up bars. I’ve since had a lifelong disdain for dodgeball. But I’m a mature adult now, confident, not easily intimidated. I can even do a chin-up (sort of). Ballet and Mr. C don’t scare me.

“OK ladies, hands on barre, stand up tall,” he instructs. How hard could this be? One by one, Mr. C critiques our posture. He points his finger at various body parts while sternly giving feedback: “Head up, neck long, chest proud, stomach in, back straight, buttocks tight…” I’m last in line and have taken note of every previous adjustment. I’ve got this. He looks at me and I know instantly that I’ve missed something. “Breathe!” he says. “It must look effortless. No one wants to see clenched face. It’s ugly.”

Mr. C has us doing a little routine at the barre. “Pointe, demi-pointe, plié,” he cues. I’m concentrating hard, trying to master the terminology while executing the corresponding movement. I’m sure it doesn’t look pretty, but he fails to notice as he admonishes another lady for not keeping her head up. “You must look proud, like a rooster.” Thankfully, he doles out feedback in equal measure.

We are practicing port de bras, a ballet term for movement of the arms. Mr. C tells us that our shoulders must be strong and our lower arms soft and graceful. I flutter my arms, channeling my inner swan. “Your hands, they look like claws,” he chides. “No one wants to look at that.”

I get nervous when Tchaikovsky begins to play. Not only do I have to remember the terms, the steps, the graceful arms and the breathing, now I also need to keep in time with the music. “Just listen, feel the music,” he implores.

Mr. C sees our perturbed expressions. “I’m not here to tell you how wonderful you all are, I’m here to teach you the fundamentals of classical Russian ballet,” he proclaims. He launches into a monologue about how we’re all too soft in this country, too in need of constant praise. I actually agree with him on this one.

After a few sessions, I find myself looking forward to ballet class in much the same way that I looked forward to roller coaster rides when I was a kid – with a mix of angst and excitement. Between classes, I check my posture in every window I pass, and indulge my fantasies with grands jetés between kitchen and living room. I’m progressing, albeit slowly. My hands are marginally less claw-like and my posture a little more erect.

Mr. C is still a tad intimidating; nonetheless, I’ve come to appreciate his demands for perfection, his discipline, his passion, his directness and his sense of humour. Maybe my elementary school gym teacher had these qualities too, although I doubt it. He was just plain mean.

Story continues below advertisement

We’ve progressed to the middle of the room. Mr. C demonstrates a beautiful diagonal pattern across the floor. I summon my inner swan once again and pretend I’m on stage dazzling the audience with my grace. “Too much drama,” he yells. I smile. It’s not exactly a compliment, but it’s a whole lot better than ugly.

Learning ballet as an adult has been a much bigger challenge than I expected. I know that I will never master a grand jeté (or even a petit one for that matter), but I’m thrilled that I finally took the initiative and that ballet still holds the same allure for me as it did when I was a little girl.

Sadly, after only a few months of lessons, COVID-19 restrictions put an abrupt end to my blossoming ballet skills. I know I’ll eventually return to my lessons – much like the roller coaster, I simply can’t resist being tortured and delighted by the fundamentals of classical Russian ballet.

Not only is there a new moon on your birthday but Saturn is strong as well, which suggests you possess the ideal combination of self-belief and stamina. Whatever you start this year you won’t stop until it is completed. You’ll make hard work look remarkably easy.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

If you want something enough you will find a way to get it. A new moon in the most dynamic area of your chart means your confidence is at such a high level that failure is simply not an option. You won’t BE a success, you ARE a success.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

Someone needs your assistance and you must drop whatever you are doing and run to their rescue. You have never been one to ignore a cry for help and your willingness to sacrifice your own needs to assist others won’t go unnoticed or unrewarded.

Story continues below advertisement

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Stay calm and don’t let people with opinions you profoundly disagree with get under your skin. There should be room for all shades of opinion in your deliberations – and, who knows, something you are told might actually get you thinking along different lines.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

If you make a decision you must stick with it. The moment you start chopping and changing is the moment when it all starts to fall apart – and could also be the moment when your rivals sense you may not be as confident as you like to appear.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

Today’s new moon in your sign means that even though the Sun will shortly be leaving Leo a new beginning is both possible and desirable. You may have to go off in a direction that others do not approve of but that’s fine – you enjoy being different.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

By all means speak your mind today but be aware that even if other people agree with what you say it won’t necessarily mean they are going to follow your lead. Your arguments may be perfectly logical but some people enjoy being perverse.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

Today’s new moon will give you the courage and the confidence to take on a new task and also to take the kind of risks that make success more likely. You don’t have to be secretive about your ambitions – in fact the more people know about them the better.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

You don’t lack for fighting spirit but you do need to channel it in the right direction. No matter how much someone in a position of power annoys you today DO NOT take them on. Use your energy purely for creative purposes – and keep your lip zipped!

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

The plans you made earlier in the year are beginning to pay off, if not financially then certainly in terms of power and prestige. Don’t allow yourself to be distracted by people who don’t share your drive and determination – there’s still lots you need to accomplish.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

If you want to start something of a business nature then now is the time. Today’s new moon will make it easy for you to approach people who can pull financial strings and make it happen for you. But remember, their assistance won’t come for free.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

You have your suspicions that someone is up to no good and what happens today will help you prove it. It may, however, pay to keep what you discover to yourself for now. The value of that information is likely to grow with time.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

You may not have quite as much energy in your tank as you think you do, so pace yourself sensibly and make sure you are never in a situation where you have to rely on other people to get you over the finishing line. Choose your races wisely.

“You’re going where? In February? At your age?”

Friends’ voices rang with disbelief when I announced plans for my first-ever solo holiday – a two-and-a-half-week jaunt from balmy Victoria to snowbound Churchill, Man. I listened to dire pronouncements about vicious polar bears, frigid temperatures, shut-down tourist facilities and expensive air-ambulance evacuation.

Story continues below advertisement

Having thoroughly researched my trip, I shared none of these qualms. I explained that polar bears are not skulking around town in February. They are far out on Hudson Bay, hunting seals on the ice. In late winter, the average temperature in Churchill is -20 C, familiar to me after 45 years on the Saskatchewan Prairies. February/March is the aurora borealis season, so services would be open for tourists. Not as many as summertime but, on the plus side, there wouldn’t be black flies or mosquitoes.

“At your age?” There was only one answer to this rebuke: “I won’t be younger next year.” I have embarked on a campaign called “Embracing 80,” doing 80 new things before I reach that venerable age. The occasion of my 78th birthday seemed an ideal time to visit Churchill. And just in case – Churchill has comprehensive hospital facilities.

Besides, this was a research trip. I’m writing a novel about Scottish Highlanders evicted from their land in 1813 and forced to immigrate to the New World. Unforeseen circumstances caused them to spend the winter near the small Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) outpost at the mouth of the Churchill River. Obviously, I needed to experience Churchill in winter to fully imagine their ordeal. This argument convinced my family there was a compelling reason for my madcap adventure, other than incipient dementia.

Before embarking, I showed my walking group my new waterproof hiking boots, guaranteed to protect to -40, Celsius or Fahrenheit. “Those won’t be warm enough,” admonished well-meaning friends recently returned from Mexican beaches. “I’ll wear thick socks,” I countered.

I did feel a twinge of anxiety about being lonely, travelling on my own. That concern was quickly dispelled. From my first phone call to the Churchill Chamber of Commerce, I felt warmly welcomed. When I chatted with Bill, the proprietor of the Iceberg Inn, he promised to arrange personalized tours. In addition, he offered to bake a birthday cake. A woman I met on the plane ride north gave me a scenic tour of the area before dropping me off at my cozy lodge.

After checking in, I donned my borrowed winter gear – snow pants, down-filled coat, fur-lined mitts – and took my first walkabout. My new boots were perfect for crunching over the dry snow that squeaked with every step. That sound reminded me of winter in Saskatchewan. As I strolled down the main street, the wind stung my cheeks. Pulling down my hat flaps, I carried on to the edge of town, about 10 minutes away. The snow-swept flatlands extended to a line of trees far off on the horizon. I felt right at home.

On the way back I stopped at Polar Bears International House, the destination Bill had suggested for my introduction to Churchill. The instant I stepped inside, I was offered tea and cake. The curator and I bonded and spent the next hour play-fighting with polar bear skulls. Did I mention I was the only visitor?

Back at my hostel, Eva, a 25-year-old traveller from Germany, had prepared supper for herself, Bill and me. Did I feel lonely? Not for a second. Eva became my close companion for restaurant meals and strolls about town. The age difference didn’t matter. We recognized the same curiosity and exuberance in each other, and shared the same awe for the barely touched northern terrain. I quickly realized that wilderness outposts like Churchill attract free spirits who think outside mainstream cultural constraints.

I threw myself into each new adventure. With snowshoes on my feet, I sank down mid-calf into fresh snow, as opposed to floundering waist-deep without them. Yes, I could waddle adequately on a hard-packed trail, but I wanted to experience the challenge of travelling through deep drifts. Each foot had to be drawn straight up with bent knee and carefully placed a step ahead. It required mental concentration to teach leg muscles this new way of walking, not to mention these same muscles protesting for several days. Now I have some understanding of the struggles my poor Highlanders faced on their 150-mile snowshoe trek to York Factory.

Bill arranged an excursion across the Churchill River, about two miles wide at its mouth. My guide, Steve, took me in his side-by-side Ski-Doo. He assured me he was a Northern Ranger, so I was safe with him. Focused on the forthcoming adventure, I hadn’t worried for an instant about my welfare. But just in case, the rifle slung on his back instilled confidence. Near both shores ice ridges erupted from the frozen surface like grotesque sea monsters. I yelled “Stop!” several times to take photos.

On the far shore, Steve took me wherever I wanted to go. The first stop was Sloop’s Cove, an extended area of flat rocks where various HBC employees from the past had carved their names. This was where my characters had been dumped off their ship, instead of at York Factory where accommodation awaited them. At the ruins of Fort Prince of Wales the only other footprints had been made by an Arctic hare. Another advantage of the off-season – I fully experienced the isolation of the desolate, treeless tundra.

When the wind was still, the silence of the snow-shrouded tundra was overpowering. There was no sound except my own breathing. If I moved, I heard my footfall on the creaking snow. On the frozen water near shore, I heard ominous groaning as the ice shifted with the flowing tide. At night, the Northern Lights evoked body-tingling awe no photograph could duplicate. These memories will enliven winter-survival scenes in my novel.

The railway station is a two-minute walk from the Iceberg Inn. During my birthday dinner, two French guests started getting restless about missing their 7 p.m. boarding time. At 6:45 p.m., Bill and Eva were just lighting candles for the cake. Well, who should emerge from one of the bedrooms but the train engineer after an afternoon nap. Problem solved. We invited him to share some cake, knowing the train could not leave without its driver.

Story continues below advertisement

When my own departure date arrived, I was torn between reluctance to leave and giddy anticipation of riding the rails. The train crew was another cast of quirky characters who pampered me for the next two days. Munching treats in the dome car, I watched tundra slip into forest and signs of human habitation emerge bit by bit. When I couldn’t stay awake another minute, I snuggled into my own private sleeping cocoon.

At no point did anyone in Churchill imply that I was too old to be there. We were all busy exploring the environment and the history. The next time I have an opportunity for some offbeat adventure I’m going to take it. And so should you. You won’t be younger next year.

With communities on Haida Gwaii adapting to increased travel restrictions after a recent COVID-19 outbreak, staycations have taken on a new importance in the remote islands. The 20-person outbreak is believed to have occurred after residents who travelled off-island returned home. So now, in addition to new provincial restrictions banning all visitors to Haida Gwaii, Carla Lutner, chief operations officer of the Gwaii Trust Society, says local leadership is encouraging residents to stay on Haida Gwaii whenever possible.

To help, the Gwaii Trust is offering up to $250 in grants for Haida and residents of Haida Gwaii (Haidagwaii’an) for staycation expenses. “The grant helps locals explore and provides assistance for local tourism businesses,” says Lutner.

Lutner says the grants have been well received. They’ve also provided some much-needed distraction on the hard-hit islands. “A popular topic of conversation is people asking each other, ‘What are you going to do with your staycation money?’” she says.

Families can pool their money, and so far requests for the funds have ranged from cabin rentals on North Beach to cultural tours in Gwaii Haanas to fishing charters for entire families.

A Tourism Industry Association of Canada report predicts that without further support, some 61,000 tourism businesses in Canada, or 57 per cent, are projected to fail, putting 1.66 million Canadians out of work. To stem the losses, government programs have been offering emergency wage subsidies and other grants. Meanwhile, professional organizations have been teaching tourism businesses enhanced cleaning techniques and offering marketing tips to entice locals. But there’s still a need to find innovative ways to get people out exploring safely and spending money locally.

New Brunswick recently announced a $3-million staycation rebate program for residents. The province’s grant encourages locals to stay and spend in nearby communities, and offers a 20-per-cent rebate of up to $1,000 per person. Eligible expenses include travel costs like fuel and car rentals; accommodation including hotels, motels, inns, B&Bs and campsites; restaurant meals; and activities like museum fees and outdoor tours.

Local travel must include a paid overnight stay in the province up to Sept. 30. According to a statement by Tourism, Heritage and Culture Minister Bruce Fitch, “the rebate will not only encourage New Brunswickers to travel and discover the natural beauty and diversity of the province,” but support tourism businesses when they need it the most.

PEI is also exploring ideas that will spur in-province travel. Internationally, Ireland has recently announced its own program. Ireland’s staycation voucher offers citizens a refund of 20 per cent on restaurant and hotel bills in the form of a tax credit. The rebate, which begins in October and is expected to run until April, 2021, is good for individual expenses up to €625 (with the rebate worth up to €125, or roughly $195), and double that for couples. Regionally, 56,000 households in Kerry are receiving an additional €100 that can be used for a range of registered county accommodations, in an effort to keep them even closer to home.

James Cowpar, co-owner of Haida Style Expeditions, which specializes in cultural adventure tours, says for businesses, the $250 individual grants are a lifeline. The Indigenous-owned company, which normally hosts travellers from around the world on its daily tours, had been expecting a banner season. Instead, as trips were cancelled and deposits returned, the company initially fell through the cracks of the federal stimulus funding.

Now, Cowpar says they hope to run two to three tours a week for August and September. “The benefits will help to keep local businesses alive, and will give people an opportunity to visit Gwaii Haanas and enjoy outdoor recreation,” he says.

Destinations that don’t have financial incentives to encourage locals to visit are still hoping travellers bust out their travel savings and splurge on local experiences.

Maya Lange, vice-president of marketing at Destination BC, says local support is going to be crucial to the long-term survival of many tourism businesses: “When you support tourism businesses, you support your friends, families and neighbours, and the small businesses that make up the foundation of our industry.”

Equally important, says Lange, is the fact that tourism businesses contribute to a region’s identity. “Tourism plays a positive role in preserving, sharing and celebrating the rich culture and history of B.C.‘s diverse communities and people,” she says. “Think about the things we enjoy that would not be as viable without the tourism engine: museums and galleries; festivals and sports events; air, highway and coastal transportation; dining and wine touring; and parks and recreational facilities.”

An essential building block for many classic cocktails, from martinis to manhattans, vespers to negronis, vermouth continues to enjoy a welcome resurgence. It’s such a staple for mixology that it’s easy to overlook that it doesn’t need to be mixed with other spirits at all.

Traditionally produced in Italy and France, vermouth is made from wine that’s been fortified with neutral grape spirit (unaged brandy) and bottled between 16 and 18 per cent alcohol. Its real character, however, comes from flavour enhancement by various herbs, botanicals and spices, and whether it’s made in dry (typically white) or sweet styles (red or white).

Mildly bitter red vermouth is usually sweet and more closely associated with Italy: Carpano Antica Formula represents the high end, while Cinzano Rouge and Martini & Rossi hold forth as brand champions. Floral and fragrant white vermouth was popularized by French brands, such as Dolin and Noilly Prat.

Eight innovative spirits to up your summer mixology game

Purists would insist that I explain how the honeyed and citrus-flavoured Lillet Blanc, the fortified wine brand made popular by James Bond’s Vesper Martini order from Casino Royale, isn’t technically vermouth. It contains citrus liqueur and doesn’t include wormwood, which is one of vermouth’s key botanicals and the inspiration for its name. Wormwood in German is “wermut.”

The cocktail boom and rise of craft distilling has created room for an increasing array of vermouths and other wine-based apéritifs to come to market. New and more strongly flavoured styles, including barrel-fermented examples as well as rosé expressions, have joined the ranks and added greater variety for mixologists and consumers to appreciate and explore. Because of the wide assortment of botanicals and selection of wines used in production, vermouth comes in a range of styles based on the producer’s recipe.

In Italy, Spain and France, traditionalists enjoy vermouth served chilled, on the rocks or with soda water with a twist of orange or lemon. (Having occasionally reached for the wrong can in haste, I can attest tonic water works, too.) That’s how I propose you embrace vermouth as summer rolls into fall.

Keep it simple. Keep the bottle in the fridge. (That’s always good practice as vermouth starts to oxidize after a month’s time). Leave mixing cocktails for another day. Embrace its ethereal, floral and refreshing nature, and if you’re so inclined, imagine you’re drinking with the locals in Barcelona.

The summer of COVID-19 has been screen-soaked. From virtual camps and online summer school to chatting with friends and engaging in endless hours of gaming, the onslaught of screens on children has been relentless and, to a large extent, unavoidable.

But come September, when the new school year begins, tech habits will need to be recalibrated. “This is a great time to rewire our kids’ brains and create new healthy pathways for the use of technology,” says Dr. Shimi Kang, addiction psychiatrist, speaker and author of The Tech Solution. “Take food, for instance. In the beginning of the pandemic, we let go a little – stress eating, snacking, etc. – but quickly realized that this is not sustainable, that it is unhealthy for us in the long run. Similarly, after having loosened up on the rules around technology and screen time, we now need to scale back the use of junk tech, especially by our kids.”

In her book, she cites examples from sessions with her own patients and explains how screen consumption affects adolescent brains. She also offers practical strategies that parents and caregivers of children can adopt to augment the benefits of good tech. “Parents always talk about setting time limits for tech usage or banning tech for long periods of time. This simply won’t work, more so now since tech has completely embedded our lives. We need to move from screen time to screen quality. We need to understand what screen consumption is doing to us at a biological level, to our brains and bodies,” she says.

Kang outlines a plan that aims to rebalance tech consumption using the metaphor of a diet. The steps involve motivating your child to make a change in their tech habits, guiding them through the process and finally taking inventory and celebrating their efforts. But Kang acknowledges that every family will respond to the strategy differently based on its unique challenges.

“In general, it takes a certain amount of time – 21 to 90 days – to change our habits … the science differs. The point is to establish an understanding that it takes time to move off certain neuro-trails, rewire our brains and move on to healthier habits. Change is a process. We know that when we are making a behavioural change, the first response is to be in denial. Then with more information, we start to contemplate that maybe there are benefits to this change, we then prepare for change, implement it, we also relapse but then get back,” she says.

Here are Kang’s top strategies from The Tech Solution.

Talk to kids about toxic tech

Just like you talk to your child about the benefits of healthy food for their bodies and minds, speak to them about how the kind of tech they consume affects the way they feel and behave. Engaging negatively on social media, sexting, constantly looking for online validation from peers and cyberbullying are all examples of toxic tech and need to be dealt with firmly. “We block all potential gambling and pornography sites, and with our older kids I frequently check in and discuss the toxicity of FOMO, online comparisons and unintentional multitasking,” says Kang.

Limit junk tech

Scrolling mindlessly on Snapchat or constantly checking likes on Instagram are classic examples of indulging in junk tech. “When it comes to tech, there is no regulation around it. On one side of the screen is a child’s brain, which is underdeveloped ... the other side of the screen is the most sophisticated neuroscience known to us. The persuasive design of the platforms, apps and devices we use are intended to capture their attention and keep it. I suggest that parents discuss, limit and monitor video games and social media until their child seems able to regulate their own use of it,” says Kang. For parents of kids with learning differences and vulnerabilities, there’s co-morbidities like anxiety and depression that are connected to gaming addictions.

Encourage healthy tech

Kids, especially pre-teens and older, crave peer and social connection, indulge in risk-taking behaviours and seek novel experiences. Tech can be used smartly to satisfy all these propensities. “Teachers and parents will have to get creative with the tasks they assign to them – getting them to take risks and learn new things, write an essay in a different way, create a video project using tech, there’s so much that technology can do from an innovation standpoint. With healthy tech you allow yourself to care, make meaningful connections with people and are able to be creative. You can be flexible and let your kids enjoy exploring the world online as long as their time is balanced with other healthy real-life habits,” says Kang.

After years of research and hard work, this summer I was promoted to full professor by Brock University. It’s ironic that this progress for a visible minority happened during the “great pause” of COVID-19, and when society was finally – remarkably – awakened to racism by the killing of George Floyd.

Like a lot of people in these never-before-seen times, I took a long look in the mirror. How could this be happening? I had been in academia for a quarter-century and thought I was making a difference. How to find hope now? Just because I had “made it” in academia? What next?

Incidentally, my research is on brain and language, which means I could be in either linguistics or psychology departments. Out of curiosity, I did a web search of those department types at major Canadian universities. My search revealed that just a handful of full professors at those schools are both female and non-white. That reality alone says, “Houston, we have a problem.”

Words can heal and words can hurt – one minority doctor’s experience

Nevertheless, I do have hope.

July 5 was Gurupurnima, a day in Indian culture that celebrates one’s teachers (a guru is one who removes darkness, or a teacher; Purnima means full moon). My son had just completed a week-long tabla (Indian drum) workshop given by a McGill University music faculty member (online, thanks to COVID-19). The workshop ended with a lovely Gurupurnima ritual, where the instructor patiently explained the significance of each step, such as how to use incense and where to place it.

Here’s the thing: The instructor, Shawn, was not of Indian origin. He explained how to perform the ritual as taught to him by his guru, a renowned virtuoso from India. And there I was, a granddaughter of a Sanskrit guru, learning about this ritual on Zoom. I chuckled on the inside at this beautiful reminder that a unique feature of our human brains (other than our neurocognitive ability to use language) is that we can be flexible with social identity. We can have, and adapt to, more than one. In fact, if we simply (and figuratively) look in our own backyards, we know this to be true. We each have two parents, and so we each have extended family on either side, two groups with whom we likely interact just a bit differently. And yet, we love them equally (for the most part) and are always ourselves with them.

This idea of multiple identities, being able to belong to different tribes, is an important facet of ourselves to remember as we traverse these extraordinary times.

I’ve always been aware of my several cultural identities, thanks to being from Quebec, having parents from India, and studying and working in the U.S. in my 20s. In fact, I would have to say that being aware of my different identities has always helped me navigate difficulty.

But the way in which I was formally introduced to my “other” identity was a bit of shock.

On my first day of kindergarten, my parents sat me down at the kitchen table. Dad (a statistics professor at Sir George Williams University before it became Concordia) looked serious, so I got a little nervous despite still feeling excited about starting school. He said, “Don’t feel bad if you raise your hand and the teacher doesn’t call on you.”

Story continues below advertisement

I sat there, puzzled.

“People prefer people who look like them. And you don’t look like your teacher. She will call on the Canadian kids.” (For my parents, “Canadian” meant “white.”)

More bewilderment.

“It’s just human nature. What you have to do is work harder than everyone else, so you can be the best in your class.”

Talk about pressure. And all I wanted was to wear my new cardigan and start school.

“If you are the best in your class, your teacher can’t ignore you. This is Canada. You can make it here – if you work really, really hard. In India,” he said (keep in mind this was the 70s),“it’s about who you know, not how good you are. But not in Canada. Here, you can make it.”

Story continues below advertisement

And then, as if we’d just been idly discussing the weather, we walked to school.

Like many kids, I refused to listen to my parents. After all, I’m Canadian! I was born here! Sure, kids at the neighbourhood playground called me racist names, but they were just ignorant kids. As a five-year-old, I was convinced grown-ups would know better and do better.

Today, we are all too familiar with the term “unconscious bias.” Today, we know that, unfortunately, my dad was not entirely wrong. Still, I’m glad I didn’t take his words to heart. If I had, I might have, or would have, or could have seen racism (and its close cousin, sexism) everywhere I went.

The story of George Floyd reminds us that racism is definitely still here. But I’m here, too. I can’t give Mr. Floyd his life back; I can’t return the land my house sits on to the Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabe peoples. But as a professor, I’m at the top of a system (finally), and I have a voice. In the classroom, I will continue to call on students of all shapes and colours and backgrounds. I will continue to speak up, respectfully, when I see or hear things I disagree with, or that are simply incorrect.

And I will remember that our humanity lies in our flexibility. We have the brains for it, and due to the aftermath of George Floyd’s death, we now know we have the heart for it, too.

I got back from a couple of weeks of holiday this week and saw that, during my time off, many Canadian theatres have started to sell tickets for in-person, indoor performances again.

The Arts Club in Vancouver has just announced a short season of solo shows that will play to a maximum of 50 people this fall, while the Citadel Theatre in Edmonton is opening its 650-seat Shoctor Theatre later this week to 100 people a night for a 10-minute play festival called Horizon Lab.

Meanwhile, the Orillia Opera House, first out of the gate on this front in Ontario, is already a week into a run of Norm Foster’s two-hander On a First Name Basis – selling up to 50 seats a night in a 677-seat theatre. The comedy, which stars artistic director Jesse Collins and his fiancée, Viviana Zarrillo, is on stage to Sept. 4.

Canadian theatre companies may be ready to stage performances again, but are Canadians audiences ready to attend under strict COVID-19 protocols (physical distancing, masks et cetera) and before a vaccine?

Some are. Wendy Fairbairn, general manager at the OOH, tells me she’s selling about 40 tickets a night to On a First Name Basis. (The summer theatre there usually sells about 80 tickets a night – and usually performs in the OOH’s 100-seat studio theatre.) In Edmonton, meanwhile, Jessie van Rijn, producer at the Citadel, says tickets are almost sold out for Horizon Lab.

Perhaps the strongest signs that (smaller, distanced) audiences will return to theatre during the pandemic are coming out of Quebec.

Theatre Duceppe, which performs at Montreal’s Place des Arts, announced late last week that tickets are selling well for its reconfigured fall season, which includes a pair of solo shows and a December remount of Catherine-Anne Toupin’s three-actor thriller La Meute.

La Meute has already completely sold out its 10 performances, and the short Duceppe season has sold 4,200 tickets in total to date. (The company is only selling 177 seats a show in what is normally a 755-seat theatre.)

Other Quebec theatre companies that have announced alternative autumn seasons, such as Théâtre du Nouveau Monde in Montreal (which is selling 160 seats in its 750-seat theatre) and Le Trident in Quebec City, are doing well at the box office too – and have already added extra performances because of demand.

Marie-Claude Hamel, Duceppe’s communications and marketing director, tells me that there is plenty of demand to add more performances of La Meute as well, but the company won’t put more on sale until later this fall, because they want to wait and see whether conditions change.

Conditions, or provincial politics, really. If Quebec’s theatres seem to be ahead of those in the rest of the country, it’s because that province started allowing indoor gatherings of up to 250 early in August.

In Ontario, the indoor gathering limit is still capped at 50, which may explain why we haven’t see some of that province’s bigger companies with larger venues announce alternative seasons yet. (In British Columbia, the indoor gathering limit is currently 50; in Alberta, it’s 100.)

But the audience appetite for risk may also be different in Quebec compared with Ontario.

It was interesting to see today that La Licorne, a favourite mid-size Montreal theatre of mine that normally sits 180 in its larger theatre, has announced a three-show season for 50-person audiences. The similarly sized Tarragon Theatre in Toronto, on the other hand, decided in June that its stages will be dormant for the entire 2020-21 season.

Two months ago, I didn’t think I’d be ready to see a show indoors, but now I think I am – if the proper safety measures were in place. What about you? Let me know at knestruck@globeandmail.com.

This week, I’ll be headed out to review my first play since March – but it will be outdoors. I’ll be seeing the Theaturtle production of Wajdi Mouawad’s solo show Alphonse on Thursday in Dufferin Grove Park. And I’ll be seeing it twice: Once with Alon Nashman playing all the roles, and once with Kaleb Alexander playing all the parts. Look for my review online Friday.

Gail Sheehy, the journalist, commentator and pop sociologist whose bestselling Passages helped millions navigate their lives from early adulthood to middle age and beyond, has died. She was 83.

Ms. Sheehy died Monday of complications from pneumonia in Southampton, N.Y., according to her daughter, Maura Sheehy.

Passages: Predictable Crises of Adult Life was published in 1976 and immediately caught on with a generation torn by the cultural revolution of the time, sorting through midlife struggles, marital problems, changing gender roles and questions about identity. As Ms. Sheehy noted in the book’s foreword, close studies of childhood and old age were widely available, but far less scrutiny had been given to the prime years of work and relationships.

“It occurred to me that what Gesell and Spock did for children hadn’t been done for us adults,” Ms. Sheehy wrote. “It’s far easier to study adolescents and aging people. Both groups are in institutions (schools or rest homes) where they make captive subjects. The rest of us are out there in the mainstream of a spinning and distracted society, trying to make some sense of our one and only voyage through its ambiguities.”

Drawing upon more than 100 interviews, Ms. Sheehy combined research and personal stories to probe why some marriages lasted and others ended, why some left unsatisfying jobs while others stayed, why some were able to reconcile with growing older while others never developed beyond their early years. Part of the book’s appeal was its hopeful message, as suggested by the subtitle: There’s a consistent and manageable pattern to adulthood; it’s okay not to be young any more; if you’re willing to take chances, there are richer, more meaningful ways to find happiness later in life.

“The greatest surprise of all was to find that in every group studied, whether men or women, the most satisfying stages in their lives were the later ones,” she wrote. “Simply, older is better.”

Passages helped set off a conversation that lasted for decades. The New York Times praised Ms. Sheehy for her “pertinent and persuasive” objections and a 1991 survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the Book-of-the-Month Club ranked Passages among the books that most influenced people’s lives.

But Ms. Sheehy was criticized for overgeneralizing, for focusing too closely on affluent professionals and for such glib expressions as “Trying Twenties.” She also was sued for plagiarism. Los Angeles psychiatrist Roger Gould alleged that Ms. Sheehy made extensive use of his research without giving him credit. The case was settled out of court.

Ms. Sheehy herself acknowledged shortcomings, notably that there was much to say about life after 50. She would continue with The Silent Passage (menopause), New Passages (life after 50), Understanding Men’s Passages (a midlife resource for men) and Passages in Caregiving (caring for family members). Ms. Sheehy told her own story in the 2014 memoirs Daring: My Passages.

When not writing books, Ms. Sheehy was a popular lecturer and television commentator and a well-travelled journalist specializing in psychological portraits of public figures. For New York magazine, Vanity Fair and other publications, she interviewed everyone from Bill and Hillary Clinton to Margaret Thatcher to Mikhail Gorbachev. Her 1972 cover story for New York on Jacqueline Kennedy’s impoverished relatives Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale and Edith (Little Edie) Bouvier Beale helped inspire the documentary and Broadway show Grey Gardens.

Ms. Sheehy’s honours included the National Magazine Award, the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award and a citation from the American Psychological Association.

Born Gail Henion in Mamaroneck, N.Y., the daughter of an advertising man and beauty consultant, she had been a storyteller since childhood. She was an undergraduate at the University of Vermont and a journalism major at Columbia University, where she found a mentor in the anthropologist Margaret Mead. After school, she married medical student Albert Francis Sheehy (they divorced in 1968) and had a daughter, Maura. (Ms. Sheehy and Mr. Felker later adopted a girl, Momh).

Ms. Sheehy’s journalism career began at the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle and the New York Herald Tribune, her colleagues including Tom Wolfe, before joining New York in 1968. Mr. Felker, the volatile and visionary publisher, became her mentor and lover. They dated off and on for more than a decade before marrying in 1984. Mr. Felker, who died in 2008, was the “love of her life,” she would later write. She credited their bond in part to lessons she had absorbed from Passages. She had been willing to leave him, if only to prove she could manage alone.

“If I had stayed with Clay and failed, we would have lost each other forever,” she recalled in her memoirs.

Her early books included the novel Lovesounds and the non-fiction Hustling, an expansion of her magazine reporting about prostitution and the basis for a TV movie starring Lee Remick and Jill Clayburgh. Tragedy compelled her to write Passages. She was working on a story in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s, talking to a young boy, when a bullet “blew his face off.” Many bullets followed, one nearly hitting Ms. Sheehy, on what became known as Bloody Sunday.

Back home, Ms. Sheehy was deeply traumatized, her temper raging, her private life in turmoil. She began thinking for the first time about time, the “arithmetic of life.”

“In normal circumstances, without the blow of a life accident, these issues affiliated with midlife are revealed over a period of years. We have time to adjust. But when they are thrust on us all at once, we cannot immediately accept them. The downside of life comes too hard and fast to incorporate,” she wrote for the 2006 edition of Passages.

“In my case, the unanticipated brush with death in Ireland brought the underlying issues of midlife forward in full force.”

Canadian streaming service Crave and contestants of “Canada’s Drag Race” are speaking out against hateful messages some of the show’s queens and judges have received from viewers on social media.

Vancouver-based drag artist and contestant Ilona Verley tweeted this week that she “ended up in the hospital with a suicide attempt” from all the hate she was getting after a recent episode aired.

She said she’s sick of letting people get away with bullying, and vowed to defend fellow queen and contestant Rita Baga against the vitriol she’s also getting online.

Verley later tweeted that she’s now fine and “in a really good head space.”

Meanwhile Scarlett BoBo, who is also competing on the show, tweeted: “Please stop sending hate to members of the cast,” adding: “It’s fine to have your favourites but bullying is not okay.”

In an e-mailed statement to The Canadian Press, Crave said it hopes fans will respect the show’s message of “inclusivity and acceptance.”

“‘Canada’s Drag Race’ has an international fan base, and it’s unfortunate that some of those fans have let their passion cross the boundary into harassment by posting hateful comments about our queens and judges online,” said the Bell Media streamer, which debuted the show last month.

“There is no place for hate in the ‘Canada’s Drag Race’ community, or anywhere.”

Like “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” the Canadian version is a competition series in which drag artists compete in a series of challenges for the title of the Next Drag Superstar and a grand prize of $100,000.

The main judging panel includes Brooke Lynn Hytes, Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman, and Stacey McKenzie.

Bowyer-Chapman has also been criticized on social media for his pointed critiques on the judging panel, and recently deleted his Twitter account.

“Rupaul’s Drag Race” season 6 contestant Osmond Vacious, a.k.a. Vivacious, wrote on Instagram that the criticism of Bowyer-Chapman has made the judge limit his interaction with fans.

“The bullying has to stop,” wrote Vacious.

Other contestants confronting the cyber bullying include Juice Boxx and Priyanka, who tweeted: “I know, it’s a TV show and we all have something to say. But for a show that celebrates the LGBTQ2S+ community, we have to keep this home safe.”

The Associated Press

Brian Stelter knows critics accuse Fox News of bending the truth in order to maintain its staunch support of and closeness to President Donald Trump. As CNN media reporter and host of “Reliable Sources,” he’s often one of them.

He wasn’t prepared to hear the extent of concerns about the network’s direction by people who work there.

It was one of the reasons he wrote “Hoax: Donald Trump, Fox News, and the Dangerous Distortion of Truth,” which will be released Tuesday. The book shot from No. 340 to No. 1 on Amazon’s bestseller’s list following Stelter’s appearance with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC Friday.

Story continues below advertisement

Several people at Fox privately expressed worry to him about the growing power of prime-time opinion hosts Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham at the expense of Fox’s news operation, he said.

“There is a real resistance inside Fox News,” Stelter told The Associated Press. “Nobody there would use that term. But there are many people there who are uncomfortable with Sean Hannity’s lies and Tucker Carlson’s xenophobia. It’s just that they are powerless, or feel powerless, and the prime-time stars have all the power. There are Trump true believers at Fox, but there are many others who are concerned about the damage being done, and don’t feel that they can speak out publicly.”

After being presented with details of the book and phone conversations Thursday and Saturday, a Fox News representative said the network was declining comment.

While Stelter relies on insider accounts for some juicy details – including that Hannity has privately expressed doubts about Trump despite being his biggest on-air fan – much of the disturbing content in “Hoax” didn’t require any special access. He reported what has been said on the air and how it echoed or was echoed by Trump’s Twitter feed.

Stelter is particularly scathing about the response to the coronavirus epidemic: how it was minimized by both Fox and the president, how the drug hydroxychloroquine was pushed even as studies showed it wasn’t effective against the virus, and the early cheerleading for reopening society.

“It’s readily apparent that Fox failed its viewers at key moments during the pandemic,” he wrote.

“This story is about a rot at the core of our politics,” he wrote. “It’s about an ongoing attack on the very idea of a free and fair press. It’s about the difference between news and propaganda. It’s about the difference between state media and the fourth estate.”

Story continues below advertisement

Fox News is a money machine, and although outlets like One America News Network, NewsMax and Sinclair Broadcasting have tried, none have made a serious dent in Fox’s dominance with conservative viewers and Trump fans. New Fox CEO Suzanne Scott has been praised for her financial stewardship.

Yet, Stelter’s account gives a sense that, from an editorial standpoint, there’s no one really in control – that Hannity, Carlson, Ingraham and the “Fox & Friends” morning team can essentially do what they want. The three prime-time hosts have personally advised Trump on policy, something that would be unthinkable at other news organizations.

Stelter was surprised at internal longing for Roger Ailes, the former chief executive who was fired for sexual misconduct in 2016 and died less than a year later. No one questioned that Ailes was in charge.

“When Ailes was forced out and when he died, the channel was still being produced for an audience of one – but now it’s Donald Trump,” he said.

Stelter said concern about the network’s direction was a factor in the decisions of at least a dozen people who have left Fox News in the past four years, even if some haven’t said so publicly.

Shepard Smith broke a contract to leave early weeks after a public tiff with Carlson. Megyn Kelly was stung by Bill O’Reilly’s questioning of the “loyalty” of people like her who had made public accusations against Ailes; the loud booing she received from the audience at a Trump rally in 2016 made the consequences of questioning him clear.

Story continues below advertisement

Catherine Herridge, a respected Washington reporter who left for CBS, told colleagues that Fox management was “afraid of the news,” Stelter wrote. Political reporter Carl Cameron has been public about his discontent. The book discusses the exits of several others, including Jenna Lee, Abby Huntsman, Conor Powell, Clayton Morris and Ellison Barber.

Sean Graf, a researcher who started at Fox in 2016 and left earlier this year, told Stelter that “Fox’s editorial voice, and disregard for the facts, is rejected by many of those within the organization.”

As a frequent critic of Fox and employee of rival CNN, Stelter is unpopular with many conservatives, said Tim Graham, director of media analysis at the conservative watchdog Media Research Center. They are likely to regard his book with suspicion, he said.

Graham also noted the reliance on accounts from people who are not named, saying, “I do not trust anonymous sources when the author is hostile to the subject.”

But Stelter said that there is such a fear within Fox about speaking to the press – a culture that dates to Ailes and is reinforced by nondisclosure agreements – that even some people who hadn’t worked there for many years didn’t want to be identified.

“I’m just as skeptical about anonymous sources as anybody else,” he said, “but there was no other way to tell a story inside Fox News.”

Story continues below advertisement

While he works for CNN now, Stelter said he’s been covering Fox since starting a cable news blog as a college student through his years at The New York Times. He considers the book an extension of that reporting.

He brushes off potential attacks.

“Tucker Carlson has called me a eunuch and Sean Hannity has called me Humpty-Dumpty,” he said. “So I don’t know what else they could possibly say about me.”

Kids love saying the name Raffi.

At the height of his fame, the children’s troubadour would be mobbed by young listeners when he arrived in a new city. “‘There’s Waffyyyyy!!!‘” they would shriek as he exited his cab.

The name “Raffi” has appeared on about 15 million album covers and, more to the point for his largely illiterate fan base, been wailed from the laps of countless parents in concert halls around the world.

Fellow preschool superstar Fred Penner is still in awe of the name’s power: “He had a perfect name. The two-syllable name that every child could say. ‘Raffi. Raffi. Raffi.’”

Before it was a toddler’s incantation or a marketing gold mine, the name represented a kind of private friend – for me, anyway. The sound of Raffi’s voice cooing from the tape deck in my parents’ Volkswagen Jetta is one of my first musical memories. Songs such as All I Really Need, Baby Beluga and Bananaphone imprinted themselves on my brain, then lay dormant for 25 years.

A couple of months ago, I started noticing Raffi again. I’d be scrolling through Twitter and there he would be, with the familiar beatific smile, delivering some slashing critique of the Trump administration. At first, it was a shock. This was the man who invented the phrase “bananular phone,” demanding the “fascist” “orange” “fuhrer” resign.

The name he used online was an even bigger surprise. His profile said not just Raffi, but “Raffi Cavoukian.” I found myself thinking: “Raffi has a last name?!” It was hard to imagine that he belonged to a particular time and place. In my mind, he inhabited a sliver of twilit childhood consciousness, remote and otherworldly, like the man in the moon.

It made me want to know more about this enigmatic figure, both superfamous and oddly neglected, whom I felt I knew deeply and not at all – someone beloved by millions but still reaching out to strangers on the internet.

I e-mailed his publicist, hardly believing that the man in the moon had a publicist.

The four-year-old in me is freaking out. The sight of Raffi on my laptop causes my face to do a weird twitchy thing. I’ve interviewed Justin Trudeau before and this is more nerve-wracking.

Story continues below advertisement

Raffi is sitting in his big, light-filled house on British Columbia’s Salt Spring Island with his borderdoodle, Luna. When I tell him I’m star-struck, he laughs a big, head-thrown-back laugh that says both “Wow!” and “I can actually see that.”

Open this photo in gallery When he wrote the lyrics “I’ll call the White House, have a chat” for 1994’s Bananaphone, Raffi never could have known that one day he’d be able to use Twitter to reach the American president directly. These days he skips the small talk and gets right to the pointed criticism. JONATHAN HAYWARD/The Canadian Press

Adult fans go wobbly in his presence all the time. The novelist Sheila Heti wrote about Raffi in New York magazine a few years ago and began by describing how turned on she was. (“A tremendous volt of electricity went through my body, and my body said yes.”) When Raffi met Trudeau in Ottawa about a decade ago, it was Trudeau who gushed: “‘I know every word of every song on Singable Songs For The Very Young.‘”

The Prime Minister and Heti are both “beluga grads” – Raffi’s term for people who grew up listening to his music. Based on album sales and the size of the average family, he estimates the “pod” has up to 50 million members. “It’s an amazing number,” he says, making no effort to conceal his awe.

During COVID-19, however, his fame has become a mixed blessing. Being well-known, it turns out, makes isolation all the more difficult. There are always fans in normal times: the mother in the grocery store who asks for a selfie, or the shoppers who pay court at his regular table in the farmer’s market. But when we first spoke – initiating more than a month of regular Zoom calls – B.C. was in near-total lockdown, and all of that was over.

Raffi has been divorced since 1990 and doesn’t have kids. It’s just him and his dog. At times this spring, he had to will himself off the couch and hug Luna for comfort. “You just get through the day,” he said, his jowls shaded with stubble. “I’ve deeply missed the social comfort.” This from the man who taught a generation to shake their sillies out. It was hard to see.

One way Raffi has coped is by making art. Back in March he recorded a short PSA about physical distancing, sung in the style of Bob Dylan. (Sample lyric: “Quarantine, quarantine/ On account of COVID-19.”) The great American cellist Yo-Yo Ma recently played on a 40th anniversary recording of the song Baby Beluga. (“His people contacted my people,” Raffi explained, in a mock-tycoon voice.)

An advantage of putting out music right now, when the touch of another person’s skin can feel like a faint memory, is that you get a response. The reaction from listeners on Twitter has helped penetrate his confinement.

“I do appreciate people writing to me, trying to comfort me at times,” he said. “Even as I’m trying to comfort them.”

There is an irony in Raffi’s loneliness at this particular moment: With schools and camps closed, the need for children’s entertainment is more acute than ever. Randi Hampson, vice-president of operations and new projects for Elephant Records, notes that online demand for kids’ programming is way up. “There’s definitely a hunger,” she said.

That hunger owes something to Raffi himself. Lullabies are as old as music, but Raffi helped forge a different kind of relationship between artist, kids and parents – something more intimate and lasting, something that could be called fandom. In the historical timeline of children’s entertainment, there is before Raffi, and after.

He was born in Cairo, in 1948, and raised amid a thriving Armenian community. His father, a portrait photographer, took the three children to lunch at the base of the Pyramids on weekends. But the Cavoukian family were forced to flee Egypt amid rising Arab nationalism when Raffi was 10.

“How we suffered,” his parents would tell him after they settled in Toronto. He suffered, too, at the hands of Canadian schoolchildren who made fun of his foreign-sounding name.

I do appreciate people writing to me, trying to comfort me at times, even as I’m trying to comfort them. — Raffi

One way Raffi escaped the confines of this difficult new life was through folk music, his brother Onnig told me. Inspired by the Yorkville coffeehouse scene that nurtured Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, Raffi started making his own music. For years, he struggled to find traction with an adult audience, until his then-mother-in-law, a teacher, invited him to perform at her school. It was a hit, and gave rise to an improbable career.

Raffi’s first album, Singable Songs For The Very Young, went on to sell more than a million copies. Recorded in a ranch house near Hamilton on almost no budget, it was released at the precise moment the world was ready for it. North America was on the verge of a children’s music revolution. In the 1970s, conscientious Boomers seeking high-quality products for their kids, from sugar-free cereal to educational TV shows, were making hits out of Sesame Street and Marlo Thomas’s Free To Be… You and Me.

Other children’s entertainers still view Raffi as a pioneer – someone who proved you could make it big with pared-down arrangements and emotional sincerity, rather than shrill antics.

“He really did pave the way for children’s music to be on the centre stage,” said Janice Hubbard, a long-time member of the kids’ group Parachute Express. “It wasn’t rock and roll; it wasn’t trying to pull kids in with bells and whistles. There was a purity about him.”

For all of Raffi’s mellow bonhomie with kids, he was always a careful and savvy businessman. In the mid-’80s, his record label, Troubadour, dropped every other artist to focus on promoting its biggest star in the U.S. market, Penner recalled.

“It was not a surprise when Raffi cleared house to prepare for the American onslaught,” said Penner, who was part of the cull. “He built the Canadian machine, then he built the American machine.” (Raffi remembers the split differently. “He wanted to go his own way,” he said of Penner. “It was all very friendly.”)

In the United States, Raffi would have wider horizons and even more illustrious colleagues. He met Mr. Rogers in the early ’90s when they were both slated to perform at Bill Clinton’s first inauguration. It was a thrill to meet such a “towering presence of kindness,” Raffi said. But when I asked what he talked about with the icon of neighbourliness, Raffi drew a blank. A lot of other people were there, he said. “Kermit the Frog was there!”

This was a time of transition. Raffi was the most popular children’s singer in the English-speaking world, but he was also getting divorced, moving to the West Coast and throwing himself into the fight against climate change. From then on he would identify as much with the David Suzukis of the world as with the Kermit the Frogs. The charity he founded, the Raffi Foundation for Child Honouring, aims to raise awareness about the connection between the environment and children’s rights.

Like many well-off residents of Salt Spring, he tries to walk the walk: eating local wild salmon, driving an electric car. When his phone dinged on one of our Zoom calls, it turned out to be his groundskeeper announcing that he’d found a baby bird in the garage. “That’s so cool!” Raffi said.

The bird in the garage marked a turning point in our talks. At first, technical challenges seemed to mirror the difficult emotional landscape we were trying to cross together. His audio wasn’t working on the initial Zoom session. I said: “I’ve been listening to you all my life and now I can’t hear you!” He laughed at that, but from my perspective he was silent, stuck in a digital pantomime.

Talking about fame was difficult for other reasons: It seemed to embarrass him. When we lingered too long on the subject one time, he did a little gesture I would come to recognize as his way of interrupting uncomfortable moments: He blew on a wooden train whistle. The instrument gave out a goofy too-tooooo sound. He chuckled. “I can make that sound with my throat.”

But as quarantine wore on, then loosened, Raffi seemed to achieve a measure of peace. Regular meditation made “the incessant thoughts and mental chatter just drop away for a moment.” Going to the gym also energized him, he said, showing off a disconcertingly pumped bicep. (”It’s just the lighting, man,” he insisted.)

Talking to Raffi and listening to his music turned out to be therapeutic for me as well. He always understood that playfulness is just one aspect of childhood. To the very young, life also feels deadly serious – a place from which there’s no detachment – and many of his album tracks are surprisingly soulful, full of yearning, nostalgia and even a hint of pain. It was an emotional landscape that suddenly felt familiar again. Something about the uncertainty caused by the virus reminded me of being a kid. I was eating more Popsicles. I missed my mother. One night, unable to sleep, I mentally sang myself Raffi’s rendition of the African-American spiritual Michael Row the Boat Ashore. (”Halleluuu. Yuh.”)

When I asked Raffi what made his music resonate with young people, the question seemed to wrong-foot him a little. “Kids are fascinated by animals,” he said at first, distracted by his phone. “Animal sounds are always good.” But eventually he warmed to the theme. He began talking about the need to respect the child “as a whole person,” and to remember their limited life experience. It’s also important to make music with love, he said, because kids can tell if you mean it. “The love has to be right there in your voice.”

Now he was on to something. I thought about sitting in the back seat of my parents’ Jetta, hearing Raffi sing “Hallelujah” like he really meant it, with a seriousness that said it’s both a burden and a gift to be alive – and I thought, “That’s right. The love has to be right there in your voice.”

The more we spoke, the less Raffi’s solitude seemed bleak or depressing. Maybe it was his calm, low-wattage smile, with those moony eyes and mask-like beard, which always looked so reassuring on his album covers.

His voice probably helped reassure me, too: so smooth and vital and golden, but wearing its texture and history where you can see them – like a nice piece of treated wood. How could someone so capable of projecting good feeling into the world be unhappy, I reasoned.

Raffi puts out an album every few years, but he no longer seems too concerned with sales. Musical ideas just tumble out of him, ready or not. In late July, he recorded an homage to anti-racist protesters in the U.S. northwest called Portland Moms, which Billboard magazine accurately described as “jaunty.”

The recent work can be uneven, but over the years Raffi has proven himself to be a kind of virtuoso. Canadian folklorist Sheldon Posen compared him to Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra – a great musical interpreter, someone who can take a song and make their version definitive.

Posen saw Raffi perform at a school in Ottawa once and still remembers it ecstatically. The children weren’t responding to a name or a business strategy. They were hearing love, right there in the voice.

“He doesn’t have to ask them, he doesn’t have to exhort them – they just start singing,” Posen recalled. “To hear those little voices sing along – it’s totally magic.”

The Raffi song I’ve been singing most often – at my desk, while making lunch – is an off-kilter ballad called The Changing Garden of Mr. Bell. It appears on the Bananaphone album but has a disarming seriousness about it. The lyrics are from the perspective of a child; his neighbour, Mr. Bell, is from a “foreign place,” lives alone, and tends a garden full of asters and honeybees. One day, the narrator notices a picture of a family on the older man’s mantle, and asks about it. Mr. Bell replies cryptically, with a kind of koan about the ever-changing garden.

The song suggests trauma in the neighbour’s past, and invites the question of why he lives alone. But it isn’t a song about a lonely old man.

Instead, it becomes a tribute to someone who has imparted a sense of wonder and a few helpful ideas to a young friend – a friend who won’t soon forget Mr. Bell, or his musical, memorable name.

Lorraine Thomson was the star dancer on The Big Revue, the first CBC variety show that went on air in 1952. She went on to perform in a number of programs, especially The Wayne & Shuster Show, where she deadpanned as a Spanish dancer and in other comic routines. Andy Body, who danced with Ms. Thomson as early as 1950 remembers how she was totally focused when she danced.

“When she danced, you could see the joy in her eyes. When she came at me, it was as if she was in love with me,” Mr. Body said. Over the years, Ms. Thomson was the featured performer in shows with stars such as Duke Ellington and Robert Goulet.

Ms. Thomson, who died on Aug. 13 at the age of 89, soon proved she was more than a dancer. Her comedic talent brought her jobs as an actress and on-air host. Among other things, she was the first woman to host a game show in Canada.

Lorraine Lillian Thomson was born in Regina on July 12, 1931, delivered by her paternal grandfather, Dr. William Alexander Thomson. Her parents separated when she was 3, and she lived with her maternal grandparents, Will and Flora Moody, on a farm near Disley, Sask. She collected eggs, remembering the chickens pecked at her hand, and turkeys chased her. Lorraine loved the lambs, and because of that, she never liked to eat lamb.

There were musical evenings with the neighbours, with grandfather Will playing the fiddle and grandmother Flora on the piano.

In 1938, Lorraine and her brother, Bill, moved with their grandparents to a farm in Dunville, Ont., and the two Thomson children walked to a one-room school where Lorraine did Grades 1 and 2 in one year. In 1941 their mother took them to live with her in the west end of Toronto. When she was 13, Lorraine came down with pneumonia and almost died. She said in her memoir that she was saved by “the new sulpha drugs.” Lorraine had to spend a lot of time in bed, and that changed her life.

“Oddly, I had gone to bed quite short – around five foot two – and got up from bed at five foot six. To aid in my recovery, the doctor who attended me told my mother I should take dance lessons because it was a full bodybuilding exercise,” Ms. Thomson wrote. “Dance took me into all the careers I have had in my life. Basically, my life started when I nearly died from pneumonia.”

Ms. Thomson was a natural dancer. Her grandfather in Saskatchewan sent her money to take lessons. By the time she was 16, she was performing in the chorus line at the Canadian National Exhibition. In 1949, her mother moved to Biloxi, Miss., and at 17, she was on her own. She had a number of jobs, but in 1949 she danced for two weeks at the CNE and that paid her $800, enough to cover her expenses for six months. Soon she was part of a chorus line called The Canadettes. She trained under the great choreographer Betty Oliphant and travelled to New York twice for lessons.

She auditioned successfully for the Rockettes in New York, but television was about to start in Canada and she chose that instead. By that time, she was married to Julius Mallin, with a daughter, Francesca. The couple later had a son, James, as well.

Ms. Thomson was one of the early stars of CBC Television. She performed in programs such as Hit Parade, Wayne and Shuster, and many others as well as her main program, The Big Revue. It was all live, no taping to cover up mistakes. Once during a live performance, she was hit in the head by a microphone but kept on dancing.

As Ms. Thomson gained confidence and experience, she was given many other roles apart from dancing. In 1960 she was asked to design an exercise routine for a program called Open House and was soon doing interviews as well. She was hired as a full-time host for a program called 701, which as the title suggested went on the air at a minute after 7 o’clock. One of her co-hosts was Percy Saltzman, Canada’s first weatherman, famous for tossing his chalk in the air at the end of the forecast. She pointed out it was a good thing she moved on to hosting as variety programs were not as popular, and that meant less work for dancers.

From 1963 to 1967, she was the host of Audio, a radio program that ran daily in the same morning time slot that would be filled by Peter Gzowski’s show This Country in the Morning in 1971.

“It was on that program that she really honed her skills as an interviewer. She said doing Audio was like her university education because of the interesting people she spoke to over those four years,” said her daughter, Francesca Mallin Parker.

Ms. Thomson was often a guest panelist on Front Page Challenge, where four panelists had to guess the identity of the mystery guest. Eventually Ms. Thomson was hired as program co-ordinator, in charge of booking the mystery guests and fill-in panelists.

“I particularly remember holding baby Justin Trudeau while his mother, Margaret, was a secret guest on the show. She brought him with her because she was still breastfeeding him,” Ms. Thomson wrote. “We had a room set aside for privacy, but Margaret wanted him within her sight, so Justin and I were … in the wings when Margaret was in front of the panel.”

The people Ms. Thomson lined up for the program were so interesting that she suggested the CBC set up another program to interview them while they were in the studio. The new show was called V.I.P., and Ms. Thomson was the host.

""Much to our delight, we had over a million viewers on the first run. We made over 65 shows over 18 years.""

In her memoirs, Ms. Thomson said one of the highlights of her career was going to London to interview Prince Philip in Buckingham Palace. The subject was his involvement with the World Wildlife Fund. ""So there I was, sitting on a sofa with the Prince in the same room where the Queen does her Christmas broadcasts. Yes, Philip is a flirt. But a gentle one, not too obvious,"" she wrote.

In all the years she worked in television, Ms. Thomson was never on staff at the CBC. She was always a freelancer, and she was very involved in the union that represented her, ACTRA. She was also on the board of the union’s insurance and pension fund. She was vice-president of ACTRA in 1975 and part of a delegation that went to Moscow as a guest of the Cultural Workers Union. At the time, she was the highest-ranking woman in a Canadian artists’ union.

Ms. Thomson was also on the board of the Canadian Mental Health Association and was in charge of its fundraising campaign. In 1989, she was asked to join the Immigration Refugee Board to judge refugees’ claims. “When I was in high school I wanted to be a lawyer, so I went straight to judging rather than pausing to be a lawyer,” she said.

There was a month's training on refugee law before she and her colleagues started hearing refugee claims. She was on that board for four years.

In her personal life, Ms. Thomson had divorced her first husband and later married Knowlton Nash, who read the CBC National News for many years. Her daughter, Francesca, met and married Fred Parker, who was the director of the nightly newscast. In later years the two families moved into a large duplex in a blended-generations arrangement that worked out well.

Mr. Nash died in 2014. Ms. Thomson lived at home until moving into an assisted living facility where she wrote her memoirs, finishing in December of last year. One of the final paragraphs read:

""Please try not to be sad for me. Think about this skinny little girl living on a farm who grew up and had a fabulous career.""

Ms. Thomson leaves her children, Francesca Mallin Parker and James Mallin, as well as three grandchildren and a great-granddaughter."

When I opened the business 30 years ago in Winnipeg, the majority of stores were owned by older Caucasian people. So I stood out. For the first decade I was open, I didn’t want to play up that I was a Black owner of the store, because people acted funny when they found out – I never could put my finger on why. To this day, there are some people who have been shopping at my store for 20 or 25 years and don’t believe I’m the owner. I just shrug it off, because if I had to deal with everything that had to do with the colour of my skin, I’d be fighting with somebody every day. So for me, I pick and choose how I deal with it. But my role as an owner of this bookstore is to get the right information and books into the hands of the people who want that information. We’re all going to be learning, and sometimes putting yourself into the right book and reading about somebody’s experience – that does help.

Book recommendation: Anything by Ta-Nehesi Coates, because he has a way of telling a story without being preachy. He’s just a great storyteller. Try Between The World and Me, The Beautiful Struggle or The Water Dancer.

I’ve been working in the book industry for 10 years and I’ve never seen this type of impact, in particular from a political movement, before. This feels to me like maybe a once- or twice-in-a-career moment, where an entire population is shifting toward reading one thing. We’re here to connect the right human to the right book at the right time. Fundamentally, we’re mini therapists, but we’re also problem solvers. People come in with a problem, and we find the book that helps them solve it. Other book shops are relying on being told by the media or by publishing what is the great Indigenous book of the season, and Indigenous-owned bookshops are relying on ourselves to make judgments about what we think is great Indigenous writing.

As a reading public, we need to recognize that engaging in anti-racism is not just about reading the book How to be an Anti-Racist. It is about recognizing the full spectrum of art that’s produced by humanity. This is a real problem in publishing, where the case becomes made that you should read something because it’s by an Indigenous author and not because it’s great art. It’s not that you can divorce the art from the context of being Indigenous, but it becomes this kind of moral rectitude type of thing, where you want to read a book only because it’s indicating that you are reading something by an Indigenous person or a queer person or whatever population, as though it exists for educational purposes. I really hope this interest in anti-racism work just grows the appreciation for the depth of arts that are out there.

Book recommendation: My Conversations with Canadians by Lee Maracle is a book I wish everyone in Canada would read, even though it is specifically about Indigenous experiences in Canada, I really think it speaks to the way we make assumptions and treat others. I would also recommend Me and White Supremacy by Layla Saad.





Librarie Racines, Montreal: Gabriella Kinté

There’s been an increase in sales of books that talk about racism, privilege and Black history in general. There has also been a lot of curiosity, especially from Black people in Canada, because they want to know the differences between the Afro-American context and the context for Blacks in Montreal, Quebec and Canada. Our role in those early days after George Floyd’s death was more about providing a place online, because we couldn’t see each other in person; it was more about grieving together, healing together, bringing the community together. For people who aren’t aware of those dynamics with systemic racism, it’s more about education. One of the things we are always putting forward is that we always matter, not just when somebody dies and we get a lot of media attention and suddenly we talk about Black history and racism and so on. We also tell people to read not just about our pain, but also about our joy.

Book recommendation: Africville by Shauntay Grant is part of Canadian history that is not taught in schools, so it’s important to realize that there were Black communities that had an impact in Nova Scotia. I also recommend Policing Black Lives by Robyn Maynard.

We were quite busy with COVID, because when everything shut down, we announced we were doing free delivery. But after George Floyd was murdered, within days we started seeing a massive influx of orders and requests for books on anti-racism and books by Black authors – not just non-fiction, but everything from poetry to history to literature. Just in the month of June, we processed more online orders than we did in all of 2019. We really didn’t have the infrastructure to deal with and respond to the interest. We’ve been working on it for a few months. I’ve hired three new people because it hasn’t slowed down – it’s actually continuing, which is really wonderful.

Book recommendation: Me and White Supremacy by Layla Saad has become one of the indispensable books of our generation. It’s a workbook that asks you to recognize your participation in white supremacy. Another book that doesn’t get enough attention is Red Skin, White Masks: Rejecting the Colonial Politics of Recognition by Glen Coulthard.

In the 14 years we’ve been around, we’ve seen a significant increase in interest in books by Kush voices. (I use Kush because it refers to a geographic location, rather than the words “negro” or Black, which are the terms for a slave.) Since this wave of interest, there’s been a lot of change – we’ve become much more visible. We have people calling in from all around the country to find books. For Sankofa and others that are providing this information, our role is to provide the missing link to complete the story. We want people to question all the information that comes to them, so that we don’t just accept a narrative that comes from other people.

Book recommendation: The Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey or Africa for the Africans by Marcus Garvey have a lot of valuable information. Garvey was one of the most influential voices of change in the 1920s, but his work has been completely blurred out from the mainstream, along with the entire period between Jim Crow and Martin Luther King Jr. I would also recommend When Rocks Cry Out by Horace Butler.

With the live music industry more or less shut down these days, you would think a semi-retired booking agent who only has one client wouldn’t have much to do. You would be wrong, though. Bernie Fiedler, who has been handling concert arrangements for Gordon Lightfoot for longer than they’ve been putting men on the moon, is busier than he’d rather be.

“Everybody’s scrambling to get new dates in 2021,” says Fiedler, speaking from his part-time home in Germany. “And we don’t even know if anybody is even going to be giving concerts next year the way things are going.”

The way things are going is that no one is quite sure how things are going. Concert promoter colossus Live Nation Entertainment recently announced that “live events would return at scale in the summer of 2021.” But Marc Geiger, until recently the global head of music at talent agency William Morris Endeavor, doesn’t expect to see concerts coming back before 2022, mostly because of liability issues. “There is no insurance against COVID currently offered,” Geiger said on a recent episode of The Bob Lefsetz Podcast, a music-insider chat fest. “And even normal insurance policies are pretty scarce and hard to come by.”

While the bigwigs pontificate, relative small-timers such as Fiedler book, scratch out and rebook shows again as the timeline shifts in front of them. Lightfoot, who at 81 years old still hits the road regularly to sing about a legend that lives on from the Chippewa on down, was forced because of illness to postpone shows in Fredericton, Ottawa and Montreal in the fall of 2019. Rescheduled for April of this year, the concerts were subsequently postponed because of the coronovirus pandemic.

The shows were pushed to September, “but they’re not happening now,” Fiedler says. Venues are currently restricted to 50 attendees, which is an economically unfeasible proposition. There is also a run of dates in Western Canada on the books for later in the fall. “Those,” Fiedler says, “are falling apart too.”

Fiedler, 81, is among a colourful, extroverted group of survivors from the old days of Toronto’s music scene who still hang around on the fringes. He first began booking Lightfoot in late 1964, when he stole him away from Steele’s Tavern on Toronto’s Yonge Street strip for his own club, the Riverboat Coffee House in the hippie hood of Yorkville. Fiedler, a former coffee salesman who never lost his talent for counting beans, offered Lightfoot double what they were paying him at Steele’s.

“There were 25 or 30 coffeehouses around, so you needed to have a draw,” Fiedler says. The Riverboat’s attraction was top-flight musical talent, for which Fielder had a discerning eye. The gimmick at the nearby Penny Farthing was a swimming pool and bikini-wearing waitresses.

“I never swam there,” Fiedler says. “I had my own swimming pool, at our house in Rosedale on Roxborough.”

That would be the pool Lightfoot once jumped into from the roof, fully clothed. “Everybody swam there,” Fiedler says. “Gordon, the Band and many, many others.”

Fiedler says the pool cost him $15,000 to build. He had planned on using the money from the first show he ever promoted at Massey Hall, by the Lovin’ Spoonful. “I had this incredible imagination that I might make that kind of money,” Fiedler says, with a gravelly chuckle. “The profit I actually made on that concert was $150.”

Fiedler would go on to book more shows at Massey Hall, most famously with Lightfoot (who has played the venue more than 165 times). Apparently there’s more of that to come.

According to Fiedler, a pair of Lightfoot concerts were considered for Toronto’s Roy Thomson Hall. The plan being thrown around was to limit the seating to 800 people, for health precautions, in a venue with roughly three times that capacity. “The problem is that at 800 tickets, we wouldn’t make any money,” he says.

Why not, I ask, triple the ticket price to make up the difference? “We can’t do that,” Fiedler says. “That would be $350 or more a seat.” Surely his fans would pay that, wouldn’t they? “They would. But Gordon would think that was ripping people off. He doesn’t even like it when I charge $135 a ticket.”

So, the Roy Thomson Hall shows won’t happen. Instead, Fielder says he has four dates on hold in November, 2021, for the grand reopening concerts at Massey Hall, currently closed for renovations.

Lightfoot would be 83 by then. With a recent history of respiratory issues, you’d think he wouldn’t want to risk crowds and coronovirus. “He looks like death warmed over, but he’s in good shape,” Fiedler says. “He walks everyday, and he tells me that he’s discovering houses and parts of his neighbourhood he’s never seen.”

Lightfoot’s neck of the wood is the tony Bridle Path. He wouldn’t need to go far to come across his famous neighbour, hip-hop superstar Drake, who built an opulent compound right across the street from the Sundown singer’s more modest mansion. “I don’t think they’ve met yet,” Fiedler says. “But I’m sure they will.”

Maybe Drake will have Lightfoot over to the small lake he calls a swimming pool. Who wouldn’t pay money to be at that party?"

The One and Only Ivan

Directed by Thea Sharrock

Thea Sharrock Written by Mike White, based on the book by Katherine Applegate

rating 3 out of 4 stars

Of the many, many, many (many!) unfortunate events of 2020, one that stands out at this writing is the fact that Robert Downey Jr.‘s Dolittle received a theatrical release, and The One and Only Ivan has not. Mostly, this is a matter of bad timing between two talking-animal movies. The dreadful Dolittle squeaked onto big screens in January, back when the act of watching Downey Jr. mug with monkeys seemed like the most grave injustice of the year. The One and Only Ivan, meanwhile, was scheduled for a summer bow, before COVID-19 sent it straight to Disney+.

But whereas Dolittle took the idea of chattering chimps and verbose vultures and ran it into the ground, The One and Only Ivan elevates its babbling baboons and erudite elephants to a level of graceful storytelling and emotional catharsis. The film might only be available to stream in the emptiness of your own home, but it has enough big-screen ambition that you can easily imagine it holding an entire theatre’s audience rapt.

In adapting the children’s book by K.A. Applegate, screenwriter Mike White (School of Rock, HBO’s Enlightened) and director Thea Sharrock (Me Before You) manage an impressive achievement – the pair have made a family film that treats its audience with respect and care. While there are a handful of concessions to the genre – bodily-fluid gags, easy pratfalls – White and Sharrock are mostly interested in urging their young viewers to consider serious questions of cruelty and autonomy, all without the heavy hand of message-movie prodding.

Like Dumbo crossed with Curious George, the movie follows the exploits of gentle giant Ivan, a gorilla who entertains increasingly dwindling crowds in a fading shopping mall. His fellow circus residents, including an elephant named Stella and a dog named Bob, don’t question their existence or the agenda of their owner (Bryan Cranston) much until a baby elephant comes along and starts to wonder when she might roam free.

Filming in live-action, with the animals rendered in ultra-detailed CGI, Sharrock does a slick job of marrying the mundane with the fantastical. And her voice cast is delightful, with Sam Rockwell lending Ivan true depth of character, and comedic players Danny DeVito, Helen Mirren and White himself giving range to the circus’s other critters.

Although the narrative beats will be familiar to anyone who has seen any movie involving caged animals – do you think the Mouse House would unleash an unhappy ending on its young audiences/future Disney+ subscribers? – the last third of the film still packs an emotional wallop. One that, in its tenderness and sincerity, serves as a dispiriting reminder of just how crassly most contemporary family films are engineered. While there are so many Dolittles, there is only one Ivan.

Richard Gwyn was one of Canada’s most influential political journalists of the past 60 years. He worked at a number of outlets, from the old news agency UPI to Time Canada, but he was best known for his political and foreign affairs columns in the Toronto Star. Mr. Gwyn, who died on Aug. 15 at the age of 86, was also the author of seven books, including a two-volume history of Sir John A. Macdonald and The Northern Magus, a portrayal of the enigmatic prime minister Pierre Trudeau.

Most of all, he was a reporter, a man who never gave up on a story and often embarrassed his peers by beating them to a scoop. His first big exclusive came in 1958 when he was working in Ottawa for UPI.

“Gwyn scored a world exclusive that Princess Margaret, then 27, had asked that John Turner, a 29-year-old Montreal bachelor, be added to the guest list for an official ball in Vancouver in the summer of 1958, where they danced the night away,” said Bob Lewis, former editor of Maclean’s, who interviewed Mr. Gwyn for his book Power, Prime Ministers and the Press: The Battle for Truth on Parliament Hill.

“Richard was the journalist you wanted to be,” Mr. Lewis said. “You could never stay ahead of the guy.”

Mr. Gwyn, who became such a part of Canada’s political commentariat, was an alumnus of a British public school. He had one of those hyphenated surnames and never quite lost his English accent, though he did drop the hyphen once he landed in Canada.

Richard John Philip Jermy-Gwyn was born on May 26, 1934, in Bury St. Edmunds, a picture-book English town 130 kilometres northeast of London. He was the son of Brigadier Philip Jermy-Gwyn, an army officer who served in India, and the former Elizabeth Edith Tilley. Young Richard went to Stonyhurst, a private Jesuit school for the Anglo-Catholic elite. He remained a Catholic all his life.

He next went to Sandhurst, the British military school, but soon left for Canada. He was 19 and found life in postwar Britain stifling. His first stop was Newfoundland, where he eked out a living selling subscriptions to a Catholic magazine. He then landed a job at a Halifax radio station. On the ferry over, he met Sandra Fraser, the Newfoundland-born woman who became his wife and literary partner.

They went on to become the journalistic power couple of Ottawa, she as a writer and contributing editor for Saturday Night magazine, he as a high-profile columnist for the Toronto Star. Both became officers of the Order of Canada; she won the Governor-General’s Literary Award, and he was nominated for the same honour.

After a stint in Ottawa’s press gallery, Mr. Gwyn went on to be executive assistant for the Liberal minister of communications, Eric Kierans. Two years later, he moved into the civil service under deputy minister Allan Gotlieb. Most people who leave journalism for such jobs never return. But Mr. Gwyn, fortified with insider knowledge of how government worked, returned to work as a journalist, eventually joining the Toronto Star.

When the paper hired Mr. Gwyn for its Ottawa bureau, the managing editor, Martin Goodman, told him: “What we’re looking for from you is a sense of the inside.” He delivered on that. Mr. Gwyn didn’t wait for something to pop up in Question Period or hang around the media scrums. He was out digging, using his contacts with civil servants, politicians and their army of aides.

In 1984, other columnists mused about when an election might be called. He gleaned the date through a careful analysis of inside dope, not guesswork. He knew that prime minister John Turner had flown to London to meet secretly with the Queen, asking her to postpone her visit because he wanted to call an election. “Circle the date September 4 on your calendars,” he wrote in his column. The prime minister’s office denied it all. But when the election was called, it fell on the date Mr. Gwyn had predicted.

In 1985, Mr. Gwyn was posted to England as the Star’s international affairs columnist. He covered everything from the fall of the Berlin Wall to the end of apartheid in South Africa. He returned to Canada in 1992.

Ian Urquhart, a former managing editor of the Toronto Star, said in addition to being a natural journalist, Mr. Gwyn had two great strengths: “He worked in government for five years, so he had insights most of us didn’t have. And he had the perspective of an outsider, coming from England as he did,” Mr. Urquhart said.

That outsider’s point of view applied not only to Mr. Gwyn’s journalism but to his books on Canada. Mr. Urquhart remembers being at a book launch for one of Mr. Gwyn’s volumes on Sir John A. Macdonald when he was chatting with University of Toronto historian Michael Bliss.

“Michael said to me: ‘Richard has put the professional historians of Canada to shame,‘” Mr. Urquhart recalled.

John Honderich, editor and then publisher of the Toronto Star, said above all Mr. Gwyn was a hard-working reporter.

“His genius was to take two giant steps back and analyze the situation. He was incredibly reliable, and he was a great digger. Pundits today do it off the top. Richard always did the work. He was a great reporter,” Mr. Honderich said.

The author Charlotte Gray says Mr. Gwyn was helpful and generous to colleagues.

“At one point, someone plagiarized one of his books, but he thought the novel was so good, he never said anything,” said Ms. Gray, who was Mr. Gwyn’s friend. “He didn’t pass a lot of moral judgments. He was quite amused when Sir John A. Macdonald or Joey Smallwood flirted with scandal. He was a pragmatist and understood what politics requires.”

Mr. Gwyn was also a force on television even though he was not naturally telegenic. He did several programs at TVO, the Ontario public TV network, starting with Realities, a program he did with journalist Robert Fulford. From 1994 he was a regular on Studio 2, the daily current-affairs program on TVO. That was so popular TVO expanded it to a program called Diplomatic Immunity, where he would appear with his fellow panelists, Eric Margolis and Janice Stein.

Steve Paikin said Mr. Gwyn was a natural on television.

“The guy could communicate. He could organize his thoughts well and articulate them well, and he played well with others. He could disagree with somebody else if he was in the midst of a debate without being personal or resorting to ad hominem attacks. That’s what made him so good at what he did,” Mr. Paikin said.

“Richard was a particular kind of guy. He didn’t know about sports, nothing about the Leafs or the Blue Jays, he didn’t golf, and as a result, his passion in life was issues, the country and the world. Policy, thinking, writing and reading were the things that he loved to do, and he could do all of them with the best of them,” Mr. Paikin said.

Mr. Gwyn was modest about his success. He said he was lucky to be born when he was, 11 years before the start of the postwar baby boom.

“The big thing in life is to time your birth. I was just ahead of the baby boomers. You didn’t have to worry about getting jobs. [Today] I would be struggling,” he told Mr. Lewis.

Mr. Gwyn felt he was lucky to come to Canada.

“The Canadian values of tolerance, civility, and decency are precious and are becoming more and more rare the world over,” he wrote in 1997. In one of his last columns in the Toronto Star in 2016, he said: “For some time now, it’s been obvious that Canada is one of the most successful countries in the world.”

Mr. Gwyn stopped writing and appearing on television as he realized he was suffering from dementia. He leaves his wife, Carol Bishop-Gwyn."

Podcasting has been a boon for fans of theatre, and now, with stages closed down because of health regulations associated with COVID-19, storytelling serials are a lifeline. These three podcasts arrive just in time for those jonesing for drama.

Metamorphosis – A Viral Trilogy: From the Giller-winning author André Alexis comes a pandemic-inspired audio drama in three parts, directed by Ross Manson. The first instalment is Lucretia in Quarantine, in which a young teenager (voiced by Bahia Watson) documents her motherless, near feral existence in a daily journal. It’s a poignant story of fear, family and survival, involving the adoption of a baby raccoon. In an allegory for these weird times, the lines between human and animal are blurred: A confused “pet” shrieks; its unprepared caretaker is just as scared. “I wonder what it would be like,” Lucretia says, “if you had to remember you were human.” The trilogy is presented by Volcano Theatre, TO Live, Canadian Stage and SummerWorks theatre festival, with new episodes dropping Aug. 24 and 31.

Playing On Air: This continuing American radio and podcast series was launched in 2012 to present short plays – a preferred form of many playwrights because of the pithy dramatic possibilities, and yet they are rarely performed professionally outside of theatre festivals. Though the Playing On Air productions are bite-sized, they’re not short on big names, with actors Ed Asner, Elizabeth Ashley, Adam Driver, Kathleen Turner and Jesse Eisenberg being just a few of the A-listers on board for these stripped-down performances. A new season comes this fall, but meanwhile Playing On Air is re-releasing a few old episodes, including Happy by Alan Zweibel of Saturday Night Live, It’s Garry Shandling’s Show and Curb Your Enthusiasm fame. Taped in front of a live audience, Happy stars Frankie Faison and Scott Adsit in a delightful curve-balling comedy about a New York Mets fan who looks up a former boys-of-summer hero of his.

Ghosts of the Royal Alex: Figuring that every good ghost story needs a twist, Mirvish Productions marketing and sales director John Karastamatis came up with a crowd-sourcing gimmick. At the end of each chapter of this spooky six-part tale about Toronto’s historic (and apparently haunted) Royal Alexandra Theatre, listeners are invited to submit ideas on what should happen next. The backstage story read by actor David Mucci is set in 1959, when the new television fad contributed to a decline in theatre attendance in general and the building of the modern, bigger O’Keefe Centre nearby threatened the Royal Alex’s livelihood in particular. The script comes from Karastamatis, and while he’s no playwright, as a promotion man he knows there’s nothing more frightening than an empty theatre.

Layton Reid was a globe-trotting photographer—then came a melanoma diagnosis. He returned home to Halifax to work as a wedding photographer. After remission, he got married and had a son. But, the melanoma returned and it was now at Stage IV. This Is Not the End of Me is Dakshana Bascaramurty’s tale of her friend’s three-year journey as he tried desperately to stay alive for his young son, Finn, and then found purpose in preparing Finn for a world without him.

As her return to work and Finn’s transition to daycare loomed, it was difficult for Candace to come to terms with the fact that Finn was no longer a baby, no longer an appendage whose survival was dependent on her. And that, more than anything, made her long for another baby. But Layton had now made it clear that wasn’t going to happen. This wasn’t something she could wear him down on like she had with so many things before. What bothered her was that Layton couldn’t cut her any slack, couldn’t bring himself to see her perspective, or even sympathize with what was a natural hormonal, emotional response to this point of transition. Why did he see her motivations as selfish?

Candace brought up the possibility of marriage counselling, but with so much on both their plates, it seemed like an inaccessible luxury—to even find the time to go to an appointment or coordinate a house call with a therapist was out of reach. The solution was what it had been since Layton began Gerson: Candace gave in and told her husband that their marriage was more important than having another child. As soon as she let it go, she could feel things thaw between them.

Finn had now gotten used to life without his dad, who had been relegated to a sort of supporting character in his world. At Finn’s daycare, there was a corner where they posted pictures of the children’s parents and siblings, and if a child ever felt particularly homesick or upset, one of the staff would walk him or her up to the wall to stare at their family snapshot. The idea of that was so heartbreaking to Layton: that these children might be traumatized by being separated from their families for only a few hours. What would happen if it wasn’t only one day? What if it was forever? Surely a photo on the wall wouldn’t cut it.

The sadder thought: would Finn even take comfort from seeing his father’s photo on the wall? Now Layton, in recovery from lung surgery, could see Finn for only about an hour a day after Candace brought him home from daycare. Before, when she carried Finn through the door, he’d screech in excitement at seeing his daddy again, but now he was more subdued. Layton couldn’t hold him or play with him or do much more than watch him while they were in the same room together. He’d become a stranger to his son. Still, it was thrilling to see Finn’s independent personality developing. He had his own language he spoke now, a highly articulate baby babble, and he’d mimic his parents and dance and give high fives to anyone who asked for one. This was the motivation to get better that outweighed all the rest. Layton believed that Finn needed him to some small degree, but he needed Finn more.





In a house with a loud, obnoxious dog, a wild toddler, and the frequent presence of two extroverted women, Callie the cat was in many ways the member of the household most like Layton. And so when she died in the new year, Layton took it harder than Candace did. He and Callie could be in each other’s company, silent, not needy, but a mutually comforting presence. In Ottawa, in those difficult months following Layton’s first diagnosis, Callie would sit on his chest: a warm, furry mound lightly breathing as he watched TV or worked on his laptop. She always found a way to lighten the mood. But as new members moved into the household, the attention she received steadily decreased.

Their veterinarian thought Callie had leukemia and had advised they put her down. At the appointment, Layton found it chilling to see a warm body inhaling oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide suddenly go cold and still.

When Layton returned home, it was as if Finn knew his father had experienced loss: he reached out to him more to play, to snuggle. Even though Layton knew intellectually that his son was too young to understand death or mourning, he took comfort in explaining this extra affection this way. It was a wonder that this child, who so recently had been a clump of cells, was now showing early signs of empathy. Layton’s favourite framed photo in the house was the one of Finn on the day he was born: freshly pulled out of Candace, a wrinkled mass, eyes wide and adjusting to the light and, more broadly, to the world outside his mother’s body.





In April, Layton went in for a CT scan and he was feeling optimistic. If things came back clear, he’d wind down Gerson and return to something of a normal life again. He’d been figuring out how to re-enter the photography scene—a full-day wedding would be too much for him to dive right into, but maybe he could set up some kind of portrait business, an interesting way of capturing all the guests who attended a wedding.

On the day of the appointment, Candace and Layton took a bottle of champagne with them. Layton had previously joked with his parents, “If it’s clean, I’m gonna pop it open. If it’s not, I’m going to get on the bridge and jump.”

The scan was clean. No cancer. Layton and Candace walked out of the office beaming, playfully shoving each other and saying, “You were scared!” “No, YOU were scared!”

They strolled down the bridge, the one Layton now didn’t have to jump off, popped the cork on the champagne, and both glugged some down. Layton was aware that he’d feel terrible the next day, but wouldn’t it be nice to feel terrible from a good, old-fashioned hangover than from cancer for a change?

They headed to Willie and Phil’s. Layton raced up the stairs to the den, the same place where he’d told his parents about the stomach and lung tumours two years earlier, and shared the news with them.

“That’s great, that’s great,” Willie said, smiling, and then she and Phil started talking about other things. Layton’s face fell.

“Well, fuck, this is the best news!” he said, annoyed that they weren’t understanding the significance of what he’d told them.

Willie reminded him gently that he’d always asked that they not get too high on the highs or too low on the lows. Willie knew she couldn’t be too happy about this because things could change at any moment.

Layton had asked the surgeon for a digital copy of his CT scan and received a stark greyscale image of his abdomen: his lungs asymmetrical black masses; his stomach a little blob nestled into his liver; his ribs a string of small rounds, like slices of calamari. Everything looked a little skewed and to the wrong scale, but what was important was that there were no tumours—what had been cut out with surgical instruments had stayed out. He thought about blowing up the scan at Kinko’s, sticking it in a big frame and mounting it in the bathroom or living room—visitors might take it to be a macabre art piece, but to him it would be a source of inspiration. Maybe seeing that scan would help his parents understand how huge this news was.

But Willie and Phil had been right to hold back from celebrating with their son. A week later, Layton, Candace, and Finn were playing in the yard when the colour suddenly drained from Layton’s face. He told Candace he was tired and needed to sit down, and she followed him inside. As he stood in the kitchen, he suddenly looked up to the ceiling, his neck tracing a circular path as though there was a bird or wasp flying overhead. Then his legs buckled under him and his whole towering frame fell to the kitchen floor and he began convulsing.

Three producers of The Ellen DeGeneres Show have exited amid allegations of a dysfunctional workplace that harboured misbehaviour including sexual misconduct and racially insensitive remarks.

Executive producers Ed Glavin and Kevin Leman and coexecutive producer Jonathan Norman have “parted ways” with the long-running daytime series, a spokesperson for producer Warner Bros. said in a statement Monday.

An internal company investigation of claims about the show was prompted by a BuzzFeed News report in July based on 36 interviews with ex-staffers, who complained about or said they witnessed improper and unfair treatment.

Most of the allegations were tied to executive producers and senior managers, including Glavin, Leman and Norman, BuzzFeed News said. The people making the claims against them were not identified.

A representative for Leman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. Representatives for Glavin and Norman couldn’t immediately be found.

In statements to BuzzFeed News after the July 30 story was published online, Leman denied “any kind of sexual impropriety” and Norman said he categorically denied the accusations.

DeGeneres informed staff of the shakeup Monday in a video conference call, according to Variety, which first reported the development. She said she found claims about the show’s environment to be “heartbreaking,” the trade publication said, citing unidentified sources.

The comedian and host had sent a memo to her staff after last month’s BuzzFeed article, recalling her early promise of ensuring a workplace where “everyone would be treated with respect.” Something changed, she said, “and for that, I am sorry.”

The show debuted in 2003.

In a separate July statement, Warner Bros. said parent company WarnerMedia’s investigation revealed what it called “some flaws in the show’s daily management.”

Story continues below advertisement

Although not all of the allegations were corroborated, the studio said it was “disappointed that the primary findings of the investigation indicated some deficiencies related to the show’s day-to-day management.”

No details were specified at the time, and Warner Bros. had no further comment Monday beyond confirming the producers’ departures.

The second-in-command at the Bank of Canada said Wednesday that any changes to the underpinning of its monetary policy will be judged against how they affect the distribution of income and wealth in this country.

Senior deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said the various frameworks the bank is considering are also being tested for how they fare in good economic times and bad.

The central bank is examining its monetary policy framework ahead of its renewal and is looking at whether to maintain its current goal of targeting an annual inflation rate or adopt a different target.

Whichever is chosen will underpin central bank decisions, including the path of its key interest rate that can then influence the rates charged for loans and mortgages.

Speaking at the start of a day-long workshop held by the bank, Ms. Wilkins said no one framework has emerged as a clear front-runner.

She added that no matter what framework is chosen, the bank’s ability to smooth out sharp, sudden drops in the economy or provide sector-specific help will be limited.

“Monetary policy is ill-equipped to deal with sector-specific issues. We need to take them into account in our monetary policy decisions, but our focus must be on the macro economy to support sustainable growth and price stability,” Ms. Wilkins said, according to the prepared text of her opening remarks.

“In the current context, coming out of such a severe hit to jobs and economic activity, the bank must keep its eye on the ball.”

She noted that other policies are better at handling the issues the central bank can’t, such as government aid, or mortgage stress-testing to limit debt risk when interest rates are low.

“All of this together highlights the challenges of policy co-ordination and the importance of central bank independence,” Ms. Wilkins said in her remarks.

Next year, the central bank will renew its framework agreement with the federal government as part of a regular five-year review that has taken place since the 1990s when it first started targeting inflation.

The 2-per-cent inflation target is considered largely arbitrary, but the bank has found it to be the sweet spot for keeping the economy and prices stable.

If inflation runs high, the bank can raise its key interest rate to cool the economy, and drop rates if there’s a need to prod economic activity – just as it has over the past few months.

The bank slashed its key interest rate at the start of the pandemic to 0.25 per cent, which is as low as Governor Tiff Macklem says it will go. He has also said that’s where the rate will stay until the economy has rebounded and inflation is back at the 2-per-cent target.

Inflation is projected to remain low this year and next, and the economy and employment not back to prepandemic levels potentially until 2022, based on projections from the federal government, the bank and private sector economists.

While official measures show near-zero inflation, the perception for consumers is that prices have jumped since March, such as for meat, which is up by more than 4 per cent since February, Ms. Wilkins says.

“Prices that are falling, like those around travel, are not relevant to most people, but the prices that are rising, like the cost of food, are those we encounter every week,” the text of her statement says.

The U.S. dollar, which started the day stronger, ceded ground to most major currencies, as investors bid up stocks as well as risk-sensitive currencies such as the Australian dollar.

“The trade over the last little while has been to be bullish risk and to bearish the U.S. dollar. This is just a continuation of that move,” said Bipan Rai, North America head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets.

Data on Wednesday showed new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased in July, though the pace slowed from June’s robust gain, suggesting the rebound in business investment would be gradual amid uncertainty about the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.

No obvious front-runner has emerged among monetary policy alternatives as the Bank of Canada reviews its options ahead of next year’s inflation target renewal, Bank of Canada senior deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins, said in opening remarks at a workshop on Wednesday.

The Canadian dollar also found support as the price of oil, one of Canada’s major exports, held near $46 a barrel on Wednesday, helped by U.S. producers shutting output in the Gulf of Mexico ahead of Hurricane Laura.

“The road to full economic recovery is long, but a rebound in economic activity and corporate earnings over the remainder of the year and through 2021, along with ongoing monetary policy stimulus, provide broad support,” said Angelo Kourkafas, an investment strategy analyst at Edward Jones.

Earnings for the TSX Composite are expected to grow by more than 34 per cent in 2021, led by health care and consumer cyclical shares, after an estimated contraction of about 25 per cent in the current year, I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv showed.

“We believe that a sustainable recovery is underway as the domestic economy gradually reopens,” Mr. Kourkafas said.

A staggered reopening from lockdowns, supported by fiscal stimulus, is likely paying off for Canada’s economy, with activity forecast to rebound in the current quarter twice as fast as in the United States, its biggest trading partner by far.

Improved prospects for growth could provide a boost to energy and financial shares, which tend to be sensitive to the economic cycle and account for more than 40 per cent of the Toronto market’s value.

“The TSX remains heavily geared towards financials and energy,” said Dominique Lapointe, a senior economist at Laurentian Bank Securities, adding that for both sectors “the worst seems to be over and therefore we can only see a somewhat more constructive outlook in the coming months.”

Oil has rebounded this month to as high as $43.52 a barrel after trading below zero in April, while gold notched in recent weeks a record high of $2,072.50 an ounce. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners, has rallied more than 26 per cent this year, outpaced only by information technology.

“Commodity price action may continue to influence the TSX along with a possible Canadian snap election if it actually happens,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management.

A crucial confidence vote on the Liberal Party government’s COVID-19 economic recovery plan is expected in late September. Prime Minster Justin Trudeau needs the support of at least one of three opposition parties to stay in power.

Wall Street

Wall Street’s rally, which this year has been much more robust than Canada’s, is likely run out of fuel as investors fret about the November presidential election, with the major indexes ending 2020 below current record highs, according to a separate Reuters poll conducted over the past two weeks.

The S&P 500 will end 2020 at 3,300 points, down more than 4 per cent from current levels, according to the median forecast of about 55 market strategists and fund managers.

That would leave the closely watched benchmark with an annual 2-per-cent gain in a year that saw the novel coronavirus cripple the global economy and leave millions of Americans out of work.

Uncertainty about the outcome of the Nov. 3 presidential vote and how it affects markets is becoming a major concern for investors.

For weeks ahead of the 2016 election, strategists warned that instability caused by a potential Donald Trump victory would hurt Wall Street, only to see markets rally after he won.

With Mr. Trump repeatedly claiming, without evidence, that plans to allow mail-in ballots would lead to a surge in electoral fraud, some investment strategists warn that uncertainty about the integrity of the vote and its outcome could roil financial markets.

So could a potential knockout blow by Democrats, giving the party control of Congress, as well as the executive branch, which could lead to higher taxes and tighter regulation, some respondents said.

“The market is not pricing in the potential for a Democrat sweep in November, which would create massive headwinds for the economy and the markets,” said Synovus Trust portfolio manager Daniel Morgan.

The S&P 500 last week returned to record highs for the first time since February, wiping out all of the deep losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The index’s new highs confirm, according to a widely accepted definition, that the S&P 500 entered a new bull market after tumbling to a low on March 23.

Behind the S&P 500′s more than 50-per-cent recovery have been bets on a potential coronavirus vaccine, trillions of dollars in fiscal and monetary stimulus and a surprisingly high percentage of companies that beat earnings expectations in the second quarter.

Still, many investors worry about the disconnect between the stock market and the U.S. economy, which remains crippled by high unemployment and a resurgence in virus cases in parts of the U.S.

Palantir Technologies Inc., a data-mining company with deep ties to U.S. intelligence and military agencies, has shed a good deal of its trademark secrecy about its business in filing for a Wall Street stock offering.

Like many other tech companies, it will be going public without ever turning a profit.

In filings with the Security and Exchange Commission Tuesday, Palantir presented a first public look at its financials – which included $580 million in losses last year – and its heavy reliance on government contracts.

Story continues below advertisement

It also indicated it is on track to exceed $1 billion in annual revenues. It cited revenues of $481 million for the first half of 2020, up 49 per cent from the year-ago period.

Its 2019 revenues of $746 million were up 25 per cent from the previous year, the company said.

The growth included a big boost from the U.S. Army, from which it has earned $135 million since a favourable September 2018 court ruling forced the Pentagon to consider commercially available products in building its systems. That ruling opened a big door to Palantir.

The document indicated that Denver-based Palantir will sell stock some time this year but did not specify a date. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the filing.

Founded in 2003 by investors including Peter Thiel, the PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, Palantir got involved early on in government counter-intelligence work with seed money from In-Q-Tel, the investment arm of the Central Intelligence Agency.

Tuesday’s filing mentions the company’s work helping U.S. soldiers counter an epidemic of roadside bombings and assisting Special Forces in the fight against ISIS.

Palantir said it had 125 customers in 150 countries including Airbus, Merck, Credit Suisse AG and the Danish National Police. Just shy of half its revenues were from government agencies last year, the company said.

Story continues below advertisement

Palantir is reported to have raised at least $2.5 billion in funding to date.

The company’s first product, Gotham, was built for defence and intelligence analysts and has also been used by U.S. police agencies. It identifies patterns deep within data sets. Its other platform, Foundry, is designed to link various complicated and diverse systems into a central operating system.

In the filing, Palantir said it believes current instability including “systematic failures of government institutions to provide for the public” present a growth opportunity for its business. One of its current contracts with the Department of Health and Human Services helps organize diverse data streams to help make sense of the COVID-19 response. It has a similar contract with Britain’s National Health Service.

On the downside, the company said a limited number of customers account for a significant amount of its revenue. Three customers make up just shy of a third of that revenue, Palantir said, without naming them. The 2,398-employee company also cited as a risk factor its high dependence on CEO and co-founder Alex Karp, who it said was paid $12 million last year.

Also capable of hurting business is “unfavourable coverage in the media,” Palantir acknowledged, from social activism. Last year, that included the picketing of Karp’s home over a company contract to upgrade software used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Campaigns on college campuses also hurt company recruitment.

Palantir initially filed for the stock sale confidentially on July 6. It said in the documents made public on Tuesday that it had $200 million in outstanding debt as of July 31.

Story continues below advertisement

Under the stock listing, the documents say, control of Palantir will be concentrated with the company’s founders through the designation of a new category of stock. It says Thiel controls 30 per cent of Palantir’s voting power, with Karp having 9 per cent.

Hudson’s Bay Co, the owner of luxury department store Saks Fifth Avenue, has ditched its plan to raise up to $900-million in debt after prospective investors requested a higher interest rate than the company was willing to pay, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

The pulled bond offering highlights the perceived risk of lending to brick-and-mortar North American retail chains, even as swaths of the United States and Canada reopen stores and many industries have had easy access to new financing.

Hudson’s Bay, which also owns eponymous department stores in Canada, had sought the bond financing in June to shore up its balance sheet as the COVID-19 pandemic crimped sales.

However, Hudson’s Bay declined to take on the extra debt after finding the interest rate would be higher than initially expected and would come with financially restrictive terms, the sources said.

Hudson’s Bay declined to comment.

Competing department store operators Nordstrom Inc and Macy’s Inc earlier this year raised capital to bolster their balance sheets as they closed their stores to help curb the spread of COVID-19.

Other department store chains filed for bankruptcy because of the pandemic, including Saks rival Neiman Marcus Group and J.C. Penney Co Inc.

In March, Hudson’s Bay closed all ts stores due to the coronavirus outbreak. Its stores in Canada and the U.S. are now open, according to the retailer’s website.

Melissa Tait/The Globe and Mail

The Ontario government’s Capital Markets Modernization Task Force released a set of recommendations last month containing many thoughtful and worthy ideas. But one’s a clunker. It’s the suggestion that the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) should be required to pursue “a public policy imperative of growing the capital markets in Ontario,” while making them more competitive, too. That would be an addition to the OSC’s existing mandate of protecting investors, fostering market fairness and efficiency, and contributing to financial stability.

Just to be clear, only half of this recommendation is off-kilter. The part about making our markets more competitive is actually quite sensible. After all, a market that can’t attract capital does no one any good. And fostering market competitiveness fits well with the OSC’s widely supported initiative, already underway, to reduce the regulatory burden wherever possible, so long as it’s done without compromising investor protection.

But requiring the OSC to boost market growth is going a step too far, for several reasons.

Story continues below advertisement

First, in an OSC compelled to generate market expansion, growth initiatives will be the equivalent of profit centres. Correspondingly, and somewhat inexorably, compliance and enforcement functions will be regarded as frictions or “costs” that hinder economic progress. What we’ll get as a result is a regulator curiously at war with itself – incented, by its own mandate, to subordinate its policing of market activity.

Then, add into the mix the Ontario government’s standing edict that a cost-benefit analysis must be done before the OSC can impose any new regulation – and the whole thing just gets worse. Why? Because growth is readily quantifiable, but the benefits of enhancing professional standards and preventing harm are not. That means a growth imperative will win out over any attempts to tighten up investment industry practices. It’ll delight those who prefer keeping things lax.

Furthermore, consider that a requirement to expand Ontario’s investment market will force the OSC to function as the market’s marketing department. In effect, it will turn the OSC into a giant stock promoter. That’s hardly the ideal image for an agency also charged with governing the distribution of securities. It hints pretty brazenly that, from now on, our principal financial regulator will be shaping and tilting the law to increase sales.

So, why go there? Why risk degrading the OSC’s integrity quotient by imposing a mandate to grow the market?

Open this photo in gallery Neil Gross, president of Component Strategies, a capital markets policy consultancy in Toronto. Handout

Presumably, it’s to signal that Ontario’s open for business. But the effort will backfire badly. It won’t inspire confidence that the province offers a buffet of prime investment opportunities. Instead, making the OSC pump the market’s tires is more apt to give prospective investors a queasy feeling about Ontario-based offerings. They’ll be seen as instruments propelled by political credo rather than financial credence – and that’s bound to be a turn off.

What’s surprising about this proposal is how far it diverges from the task force’s other ideas for modernizing securities regulation. In many of their key recommendations, integrity is paramount.

For example, the proposal to split up the OSC’s policy-making and adjudicative functions reflects a strong instinct for rectitude in enforcement. The task force recognizes, quite correctly, that the world no longer thinks it’s okay for one entity to act as rulemaker, prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner.

Likewise, integrity considerations drive the task force’s proposed ban on tying investment product distribution to commercial lending services as well as its recommendations for improving governance of the investment industry’s self-regulatory organizations.

The same ideal is evident in the task force’s stance against manipulative short selling by those bringing issuers to market. It also underlies the proposals to deter short-and-distort campaigns, to increase diversity on boards of directors and to codify the role of independent directors.

A market-pumping OSC is completely out of place amid these principled suggestions, and the idea needs to be dropped. It treads over a line of propriety that regulators should not cross – and they don’t cross it elsewhere.

Take Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority, for example. It’s required to “promote effective competition in consumers’ interests,” but it’s not told to stimulate growth of the capital markets it oversees. Neither are other agencies such as Australia’s Securities and Investments Commission, which has a broad mandate to “facilitate and improve the performance of the financial system,” yet it’s not required to make the markets bigger.

Even the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission doesn’t go that far. Its mission statement contains no directive to promote market growth – only a more conventional requirement to “facilitate capital formation.”

Ontario’s markets must be open for business, certainly, and the government’s not doing anything wrong by dedicating itself to that goal.

But there’s plenty wrong with the idea of enlisting market regulators to act as market promoters. That’s a task the government should perform itself, through an agency set up specifically to showcase the benefits of Ontario as a great place to raise capital and invest.

Making the OSC do this job, as the task force proposes, would be a mistake. It will give an irregular appearance to how our market’s governed, and that will just repel capital and new investment rather than attract it.

Estée Lauder (DOG)

Things you don’t need when you’re working from home: 1) pants; 2) combed hair; 3) makeup. Shares of Estée Lauder tumbled after the cosmetics giant said sales tumbled 32 per cent in the quarter ended June 30, as closed stores, pandemic-related travel restrictions and the work-from-home trend hurt demand for foundation, eyeshadow, lipstick and other substances human beings ritualistically smear on their faces. With Estée Lauder also cutting up to 2,000 jobs, there is makeup running everywhere.

Target (STAR)

So bricks and mortar stores are dying, are they? Not if Target has anything to say about it. The discount retailer posted a 24.8-per-cent surge in sales for the second quarter ended Aug. 1, as customers concerned about the coronavirus pandemic ordered more merchandise online for in-store pickup, drive-up service or same-day delivery fulfilled by the local Target store. With Target’s earnings of US$1.69-billion or US$3.38 a share smashing expectations, reports of retailing’s death have been greatly exaggerated.

TGT - NYSE

Kohl’s (DOG)

Okay, so not every retailer is hitting it out of the park. Shares of Kohl’s cratered after the U.S. department store chain said sales plunged 23 per cent in the second quarter ended Aug. 1, hurt by pandemic-related store closings and weak back-to-school clothing sales amid uncertainty about when students in many parts of the country will return to class. With Kohl’s margins taking a hit as it discounts merchandise to clear out inventory, shareholders are getting a harsh lesson in the pitfalls of investing in retail.

KSS - NYSE

CT REIT (STAR)

The coronavirus pandemic has been a disaster for many retail-focused real estate investment trusts. But for CT REIT, it’s been pretty much business as usual. The REIT – which derives most of its revenue from Canadian Tire and its affiliated banners – collected 97.3 per cent of rent for the second quarter and recently announced a 2-per-cent distribution increase. The hike – which came earlier than usual this year – “should leave the door open for another increase in [the second half], provided the operating environment does not meaningfully deteriorate,” Desjardins analyst Michael Markidis said in a note. REIT on!

CRT.UN - TSX

Apple (STAR)

Number of years it took Apple to reach US$1-trillion in market cap: 42. Number of years it took Apple to get from US$1-trillion to US$2-trillion: Two. Not that tech valuations have become divorced from reality or anything, but since mid-March Apple’s shares have more than doubled, making Apple the first U.S. company to crack the two-trill mark. With all the money they’re making, Apple investors might even be able to afford the latest overpriced iPhone without taking out a bank loan.

This should not be construed as an endorsement of the report’s recommendations. For more on The Globe’s disclaimers please read here. The following is excerpted from the report:

The last five months have been unprecedented within the global capital markets with historic volatility, a laser focus on the “COVID-19 economy” and myriad projections on how the world will look coming out of the pandemic. Many companies have been forced to rapidly adapt their business models to adjust to changing demand environments and new physical-distancing requirements, and these changes have become the focus for many investors over the last few months. That said, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most powerful trends within both Canadian and global capital markets was an increased focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices. We believe this trend is poised to accelerate.

Numerous studies have demonstrated how firms that score highly on an ESG framework tend to provide stronger shareholder returns over the long term. This, in our view, is reflective of the long-term view employed by many leaders in the ESG space, and the ability of these leaders to identify both longer-term potential risks and opportunities for growth and efficiencies. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a concrete example of why companies and investors have become more focused on longer-term risk mitigation and on a company’s ability to pivot its growth strategy based on a rapidly changing environment.

With investment assets of more than $1.2-million but no pension plan, Danny wonders whether he has saved enough yet to retire in a few years. He is 63, single with no dependants. He plans to retire from his $250,000-a-year sales job at the age of 67.

When he does, he’ll be relying mainly on his savings and investments to sustain his desired lifestyle. His retirement spending target is $100,000 a year after tax, roughly double his lifestyle spending now.

Financial independence is important to Danny because he has no children or younger relatives to look out for him in his old age. Because he has no need or desire to leave a large estate, he could always downsize his $2-million suburban Toronto house to free up some cash if necessary.

Story continues below advertisement

Danny wonders how best to invest his retirement funds to achieve his spending goal, and when to start taking Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security benefits. Most of all, he worries about running out of money.

We asked Warren MacKenzie, head of financial planning at Optimize Wealth Management in Toronto, to look at Danny’s situation.

What the expert says

Danny’s closest relatives are his older siblings, Mr. MacKenzie says. “In terms of his long-term financial security, he is totally on his own.” Perhaps a sense of insecurity has led Danny to live modestly and save as much as possible.

When he retires from work, Danny will get the maximum CPP and OAS benefits, but no private pension income. His savings are enough to allow him to meet his $100,000-a-year spending target, the planner says.

Danny should delay the start of his CPP until the age of 70 because he does not need the income now, and by delaying the start date, when he does receive CPP benefits they will be 42 per cent higher, the planner adds.

Mr. MacKenzie’s forecast shows that with 2-per-cent inflation, a 4-per-cent rate of return on investments and the eventual sale of his home, by the age of 95 Danny’s net worth (in dollars with today’s purchasing power) will still be more than $1-million. He has a “surplus” of about $500,000, the planner says. “That means if Danny’s net worth was $500,000 less than he has now, he could still achieve his main goal, which is never to run out of money.”

Danny’s portfolio is primarily in mutual funds that hold blue-chip, dividend-paying stocks, small cap stocks and liquid alternatives. “While it is a sound investment strategy to use these different asset classes, with 80 per cent in equities, he is taking far more risk than necessary to achieve his goals,” Mr. MacKenzie says. Danny’s asset mix is 50 per cent blue chips, 10 per cent small caps, 20 per cent private equity and 20 per cent fixed income. The combined management fees and trading costs of his mutual funds is estimated to be about 2.25 per cent a year – relatively high given the size of his portfolio.

Danny could have all his money in a more conservative asset mix – with lower costs – and still be able to spend $100,000 a year in retirement, the planner says. “It makes no sense for him to risk his long-term financial security by taking more risk than is necessary to achieve his goals.”

Indeed, Danny’s two main goals seem to be at odds: He wants to be sure that he can maintain his lifestyle with no fear of ever running out of money. And he wants to be confident that his investment portfolio’s asset mix is designed to achieve that goal rather than some relative benchmark, the planner says. Actually, with 80 per cent in equity funds, his asset mix runs the risk of undermining the main goal – never to run out of money – if stock markets were ever to take a steep drop.

Next, Mr. MacKenzie looks at tax planning. “To minimize income tax, Danny should convert his registered retirement savings plan to a registered retirement income fund as soon as he retires,” Mr. MacKenzie says. “He should then withdraw sufficient funds to bring his taxable income up to $44,700 to take full advantage of the low rate of income tax and also get the benefit of the $2,000 federal pension tax credit,” he adds. In the long term, this may also reduce the impact of the OAS clawback. By taking about $45,000 a year from his RRIF about four years sooner than necessary, his RRIF will be smaller and therefore the mandatory withdrawals will be lower, resulting in lower taxable income, he says.

From a tax-planning point of view, because Danny has more money than he needs to maintain his lifestyle, and is planning to leave some or all of his estate to charity, it would make sense for him to get involved with a charity sooner rather than later, Mr. MacKenzie says.

“By donating mutual funds in his taxable account on which there is a large capital gain, he avoids paying tax on the capital gain and he gets a donation receipt for the full value of the donated security,” the planner says.

Getting involved with a charity would also give Danny a sense of purpose, he adds. “For many years he’s worked an average of about 50 hours per week and much of his social contact comes from his work,” the planner says. “So retirement could be an extreme shock to his system.”

Danny has said he could downsize his house to pay for nursing care if he needed it. Alternatively, he might want to investigate the cost of a long-term care insurance policy in case he ever requires nursing home care, the planner says.

Danny is now dealing with a large mutual fund firm. At some point, while he is still confident of his ability to make sound investment decisions, he might want to hire a portfolio management or investment counselling firm that operates under a fiduciary standard rather than the “suitability” standard adhered to by most commission-based investment firms, the planner says.

“It is important for the very elderly to have an advocate who will look after their best interests.”

When interest rates rise, as they eventually will, Danny might want to consider buying a life annuity, Mr. MacKenzie says. “This is a simple and guaranteed option for a portion of his capital,” he adds. An annuity would suit Danny’s desire for financial security. “People are generally happier in retirement when their guaranteed income is enough to cover basic needs.”

Canadian pension plans must give terminating employees who are not eligible to start drawing their pensions yet the option of portability. That means giving up their lifetime monthly retirement pension for a lump sum settlement, known as the commuted value.

Although the coronavirus pandemic might cause some delays, the commuted value option is still on the table.

What you need to know about managing your finances during the pandemic

The commuted value of a pension is the sum of the future monthly pension payments, adjusted for interest from now until the monthly payments are scheduled to be paid. With today’s rock-bottom interest rates, lump sum settlements are bigger than ever. But before you go that route, take a moment to consider why they’re so big.

Negative bond returns

A bond normally pays a positive return to the buyer because the sum of all interest and maturity payments from the issuer exceeds the purchase price. If the bond is resold at a higher price, then the new owner will get a smaller return on their investment. Bond prices have been rising, so the return to buyers has been going down.

At the end of July, the price of a government of Canada real return bond maturing in 2044 rose to $142 for every $100 of face value – even though the government will only pay out $137 in today’s dollars between now and when the bond matures. In other words, the real (inflation-adjusted) return on this bond will be negative. The prices of non-indexed government of Canada bonds are also trading at record-high prices, with returns (in nominal dollars) very near zero.

If you’re a member of an employer-sponsored pension plan, those high government of Canada bond prices are used to calculate the lump sum settlement offer included with your pension option statement, making the offer eye-popping. But should you take it?

The value of income security

Here’s the catch: Guarantees are expensive. What we’re seeing in bond prices is the going price for guaranteed future income. The rise in commuted values is driven by the decisions of professional fund managers who are choosing to pay record-high prices for government bonds instead of investing in riskier assets with the potential for greater returns.

And just as the price of guaranteed bond payments is high, so is the price of your guaranteed future pension. The goal of a commuted value calculation is to strike a fair balance between the interests of the individual who is giving up their pension, and the interests of their employer and the other plan members.

The commuted value represents the economic value of expected future pension payments, with no add-on for the risk that the individual might live longer than normal, or inflation might be higher than expected. There are also no adjustments for fees, or the risks and rewards associated with managing investments.

That means, as high as the commuted value may be, it’s not high enough. If you try to buy the same pension income in the retail market by purchasing an annuity, then you will have to settle for fixed annual increases, rather than true inflation protection linked to CPI increases. And the fixed rate of increases you can buy is very low – much lower than the Bank of Canada’s 2-per-cent inflation target.

Taxes are another consideration. The commuted values are transferred to a locked-in account, but these large values will almost certainly exceed the maximum tax limit. Unless it is used to buy a “copycat” annuity – a life annuity from an insurance company that copies what the pension would have paid – the excess is taken as cash and will be hit with a significant tax bill.

A personal decision

Choosing a lump sum over a lifetime pension payable at a future retirement date should come down to individual circumstances, not investment prospects. The key consideration is whether you need that pension to cover your regular monthly expenses.

Just like professional fund managers, your choice depends on your investment objectives, evaluated against the prices and risks of each alternative. If you value the inflation and investment protection of a lifetime pension, then you should seriously consider whether the risks in the stock market outweigh the possibility of better returns.

It’s hard to imagine, but your retirement could span 30 years or more. Over time, your health and personal care expenses are likely to increase, along with your need for secure income with less risk.

Retirement planning requires a long-term perspective – and the simplicity of secure monthly income is a precious gift you can give to your future older, more vulnerable self.

The banks made it clear early on in the pandemic that they were going to work with customers and not against them. Most importantly, banks announced from the get-go that they would allow clients to defer mortgage and other debt payments. Thus we were spared the agony of people thrown out of work and forced to decide between groceries and the mortgage.

A Carrick On Money poll shows the banks have done a good job overall of maintaining customer satisfaction levels through the past five months. More than two-thirds of poll respondents rated their bank’s compassion and responsiveness as outstanding or good enough, and 80 per cent said their feelings of loyalty toward their bank were stronger or the same.

Unfortunately, things will get harder for the banks as we move out the first leg of the pandemic into Phase Two. That’s when we come to the end of those mortgage and debt deferrals, as well as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. CERB, offering $500 per week, will be phased out in the weeks to come. The mortgage deferrals were for up to six months, which means they’ll soon start expiring.

With CERB set to end, Trudeau says Ottawa will create EI-like benefit for gig, contract workers

Banks extend deadline to apply for loan deferrals

The strength of the housing market, the stock market and overall consumer spending attest to the fact that some Canadians are doing fine. The financial pain caused by the pandemic is focused on younger and lower-income households – these are the people the banks will be talking to in the months ahead about debt repayment.

Bankers are always balancing the needs of customers against the wants of shareholders for higher profits and dividends. Expect this to be a fair bit harder for the banks in Phase Two of the pandemic.

Studying KiddieNomics

Every Friday, Stacy Brown and her nine-year-old daughter Miki run a personal finance webinar for kids on Zoom called KiddieNomics. Along with guest experts, they’ve covered topics that include investing, stocks and credit, as well as resume writing and public speaking. Ms. Brown, who has worked in banking and holds a mortgage broker’s licence, said the sessions are targeted at children aged 8 to 13. Are kids that age able to absorb lessons about money? “They’re already learning about finance from [parents] through osmosis,” Ms. Brown said. “They watch how we handle money.” Between 20 and 40 kids watch per week and 207 in total are registered. Viewers are located in India and Brazil, all over America and Canada and in the Caribbean, and it’s not just kids watching. “The inter-generational learning that happens on the platform is phenomenal to see,” Ms. Brown said. “I have grandparents that watch it with their grandkids.” Ms. Brown is also the author of a children’s book about saving and investing called I Will Own A Castle.

Best bank accounts for kids

Some good work done here to compare features and fees on accounts for kids at a wide variety of banks. All have no monthly fees, but here’s an interesting mix of policies on how many transactions can be done without incurring extra cost.

Your electricity bills are higher this year, right?

Spending more time at home means we’re using more electricity. One small way to contain your costs is to stick some water bottles in your freezer to help it work more efficiently. Also, you’ve got ready-made freezer packs for your cooler.

Ask Rob

Q: My 16-year-old son’s grandparents are giving him $5,000 meant to go toward a house purchase one day. We are opening an in-trust account with our adviser. I am just wondering how we should invest it, given the long timeline?

A: I’m sure your adviser will have a view on this. On the assumption that your son won’t be buying a housing for 10 years or more, my suggestion is a balanced exchange traded fund with an aggressive mix of stocks and bonds, maybe 80 per cent stocks and 20 per cent bonds. Something to keep in mind is that your son can have his own tax-free savings account once he turns 18.

After graduating in 2009, I worked four months as an entry-level executive assistant at a non-profit before being laid off.

I had limited financial knowledge, a short work history and a lot to prove to break into the field of journalism, my ultimate goal. Along the way, I picked up valuable lessons that might help you manage your finances during the coronavirus-related recession.

1. SAVE WHAT YOU CAN

My short work history disqualified me from receiving unemployment benefits, so I relied on my savings account. Even a small emergency fund of $500 can prevent you from falling into debt, and I had socked away enough to cover a few months of expenses.

Story continues below advertisement

If you’re still employed, “pay yourself first,” said Samuel Deane, a financial planner at Deane Financial in New York. “Even if it’s $20 every time you get paid, make sure you put that $20 away first and then live your lifestyle with the remainder.” Automate it with direct deposit if you can.

If you’ve lost your job, saving will obviously be tougher. Apply for unemployment if you qualify, and contact your landlord, creditors, area non-profits and family members to seek relief. If you’re still employed but have had your salary cut, consider a side gig and work on trimming expenses.

2. THINK TWICE BEFORE REJECTING JOB OFFERS

After many interviews and dead ends, I applied for an administrative role at an accounting firm and got hired in December 2009. It paid about $7,000 less than my previous salary. I knew it wouldn’t put my career on track, but it would cover most of my bills, so I took it.

Amanda Grossman, now a certified financial education instructor in El Paso, Texas, made similar compromises after being laid off as a market researcher in Florida in 2008. She took a career counsellor’s advice and relocated to Texas for a lower-paying job in the environmental industry.

“(The counsellor) said, `Look, the economy is not doing well. You need to take that job, it’s going to keep going down; you’re not going to be able to find work,”' Grossman said.

If your sector is hurting and unemployment benefits or savings are lacking, even a less-than-ideal role can help you ride out a recession.

3. GET SMART ABOUT MONEY

You’ll find a myriad of financial literacy resources online and at your local library, assuming it is open and safe to visit during the pandemic.

Story continues below advertisement

I struggled to save money on a lower salary. Credit cards became my emergency fund. I don’t recommend this approach, but times were tough. Had I learned about financial hardship programs, student loan repayment options or balance transfer credit cards, I would have saved heaps on interest and ditched debt faster.

4. ESTABLISH MULTIPLE STREAMS OF INCOME

I still wanted journalism experience and extra income, so on top of my new full-time job, I learned to shoot and edit video. I began freelancing in 2010. A year later, I also launched a small social media consulting business.

Grossman, too, had other goals. “I’ve always wanted to be a writer and I love, love, love talking about money,” she said.

While she was unemployed in Florida, she launched the blog “Frugal Confessions.” She learned new writing skills from books and sought feedback from editors at newspapers. In 2013, she left her environmental job in Texas to run her blog full time.

5. PROTECT YOUR CREDIT – BUT PROTECT YOURSELF FIRST

In a crisis like COVID-19, many normal financial rules don’t apply. You may need to carry a credit card balance to buy groceries or address an emergency. You may need to make only the minimum payment to cover rent. You may even need to contact your card issuer and ask for relief options like payment deferrals.

Even with three jobs, I struggled at times to make the minimum payments on my credit cards due to high balances and interest rates. I never defaulted, but I did stress and scramble over it. I wanted a record of on-time payments and the good credit they build so that I could qualify for future low-interest rate offers.

Story continues below advertisement

That’s a worthy goal, but in times of emergency, prioritize getting back on your feet first. Once you do, you’ll have time to address your credit scores.

6. MAKE CALCULATED MONEY MOVES

Eventually, I left my apartment and moved in with roommates. I also read the post-recession climate and, in successive jobs, learned how to ask for a raise. Every year that my workload and responsibilities increased, I made a case for a higher salary. Asking is uncomfortable at first, but it gets easier. The extra money eventually paid off my debts.

A recession’s impact is largely out of your control, but your reaction isn’t. With strategic steps, you can insulate yourself and create new opportunities.

Amid lockdown restrictions and more people than ever before working from the safety of their homes, Ontarians say they’re increasingly looking into living in suburban or rural areas, citing a desire for bigger homes and more outdoor space.

Priced out of the big city? Here are seven housing markets young buyers can afford in COVID-19 times

Rob Carrick: A reality check for people looking to cure their pandemic blues by buying a cottage

Marcus Boekelman, vice-president of real estate development for Distrikt, a developer in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), said that the trend toward suburban markets existed before COVID-19 because homes outside the urban core are more affordable, but that the pandemic seems to have accelerated it in some respects.

“COVID has really turned the market towards suburban living in a much more profound sense,” Mr. Boekelman said. “Longer term, people are commuting less and they’re working from home and so the term ‘live-work housing’ is now really the norm, whereas previously it was considered unique in terms of marketing and zoning permissions.

Open this photo in gallery Renderings of Distrikt's Trailside project in Oakville, Ont. Distrikt

Most of Ontario, including recently Toronto and Peel, has entered into Stage 3 of the province’s reopening process, which allows for indoor gatherings of 50 and outdoor gatherings of 100 people, but still encourages working from home when possible.

Distrikt has several projects in Oakville currently in planning stages; one of its communities in the area sold 200 units within 48 hours when they launched in mid-July, selling out 95 per cent of all the units available.

The properties are far enough from the downtown core that they offer affordable prices and bigger spaces, but close enough that commuting into work will be a mere half hour ride on the GO train, which stops at Union station, said Mr. Boekelman who added that talking with purchasers, many have said to him that increased work from home options are part of the reason why they decided to buy in Oakville.

“I really think there’s a type of new urbanism that’s emerging post-COVID for people,” he added.

“The demand was very high in February so we knew there were a lot of people interest, but we didn’t know what effect the pandemic could have on it,” said Troy Dosman, Minto’s vice-president of sales and construction.

When the company decided to gear up again in mid-June, it sold out all 71 homes in a single weekend.

Although there is demand for homes outside the urban core, Mr. Dosman said that this doesn’t mean that the downtown market has changed because of the pandemic.

“I think it’s clear in terms of COVID that the demand [for downtown Toronto] is going to be there, that the prices are still there,” he said. “I think there are price points in different markets and it all depends on what people can afford, what they want.”

Jim Ritchie, chief operating officer of Toronto-based Tridel, said he sees the changing perspectives in the latest OREA report as “reflective of the moment” as opposed to a picture of what the whole of real estate will look like years down the road.

The findings are important, Mr. Ritchie added, and they make sense given the current circumstances, but “we’ve not been through enough time to understand what the long term effects are.”

Story continues below advertisement

The three main pillars that determine how the real estate market is going to look and change – the economy, net population gain in the urban centre and interest rates – have all been affected heavily by the effects of the pandemic, Mr. Ritchie said.

But looking at the sustained prices of homes in downtown that are being sold and the rate at which they’re being sold amid everything that’s happening, he said he doesn’t see any drastic changes coming up that could cause a huge shift of people moving out of the city.

“Clearly people will make decisions to move away from the urban core but these things happen all the time,” he said.

“I don’t think everyone’s gonna pick up and move out of the city of Toronto and move to cottage country. Is that going to happen? No.”"

Osarieme Eweka/iStockPhoto / Getty Images

Like many of their clients, financial advisors working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic might want to take advantage of home-office related tax breaks for the first time this year.

Although tax deductions for expenses such as portions of home internet or electricity bills or even mortgage interest payments are nothing new, advisors have rarely utilized these breaks in the past because they did most of their business in offices – even independent advisors who run their own shops.

However, the pandemic has spawned renewed interest among advisors in the tax benefits that come with working remotely – especially as many plan to leave their offices sitting empty indefinitely, says Greg Pollock, president and chief executive officer of Advocis, the Financial Advisors Association of Canada,.

Story continues below advertisement

Although he says he expects independent advisors, in particular, to adjust their tax strategies accordingly, they should also use caution in deciding what to claim when preparing their 2020 taxes.

“I have a feeling the pandemic is going to create some new precedents,” Mr. Pollock says. “The whole issue of working from home and the legal definition of working from home is going to become very important.”

Cynthia Kett, principal at Stewart & Kett Financial Advisors Inc. in Toronto, says advisors shouldn’t expect any clarity from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) on what can be justified as legitimate remote-working expenses.

“It would be an administrative nightmare for (the CRA),” she says. “They would open the floodgates on all sorts of people trying to make claims. And it would certainly not be cost-effective for the CRA to try to enforce any of those rules.”

Even in the absence of updated rules, Ms. Kett says the golden rule of deductions should still apply: “If you incur a cost for the purposes of generating business, then it’s a deductible expense.”

The key when deciding to claim these expenses as deductions is being able to justify them, says Kyle Lamonthe, a partner at Thorsteinsson LLP in Toronto whose legal practice focuses on tax planning for businesses and individuals.

“Anything from your Zoom membership to an upgraded Internet package, if you can tie it back to practicing at home, those should all be good deductions. But as with any home expenses, you have to look at them and (ask yourself) what’s for personal use and what’s for business. If your whole family is using the same Internet package that you use for your business, it is probably not reasonable to deduct 100 per cent of the bill,” he says.

“Those things are going to be important. As you might expect, there’s a lot of audit activity in these areas, and we have no idea whether it will be increased because more people are making these claims.”

In terms of deducting a portion of the interest on a mortgage payment, he says that “if you only have four rooms in your house and one of them has become your office, it’s simple to do the math.”

Other arrangements can “get a little more complicated,” Mr. Lamonthe says.

Then there’s the issue of the principal residence exemption that allows Canadians to profit from the sale of their home tax-free. If advisors start claiming deductions on the interest they pay for a mortgage on their principal residence, Mr. Lamonthe says they would lose a portion of that exemption whenever they sell their home.

“You cannot keep your principal residence exemption for the entire property and claim (business deductions) at the same time,” he says.

The situation is quite different for those who hold a secondary property for which they would have to pay capital gains taxes upon sale, Mr. Lamonthe says. “Say (you have) a cottage and you went up there to work and self-isolate. You aren’t going to claim it is a principal residence anyway. … I know some people who are doing that.”

The key to getting those deductions approved, he says, is justification. For example, electricity bills that show much more power usage at a secondary residence in 2020 compared with 2019 might be a good idea.

Another option Ms. Kett says would be more useful for advisors to consider is to take further advantage of commonly used but often underutilized deduction options – such as capital claims for investments in technology, which are likely to rise – rather than try to hunt for home-office-related loopholes.

“What we are doing is that anything we feel is a reasonable business expense for our employees or for us to incur in order to be able to work from home, we’re just reimbursing them,” Ms. Kett says. “That’s going to be a deductible expense for our business and certainly a legitimate one, but trying to claim home-office expenses doesn’t really make sense in the big picture.”

Advisors will need to further embrace a holistic approach to their tax strategies as the mix of remote and in-office work is likely to fluctuate for quite some time, Mr. Pollock says.

“I think we will see a real variety of (tax) practices that were not as obvious six months ago. More people will continue to work from home more so than they had in the past. Will they retain a separate office or not? I think it is going to vary,” he says. “Some people may completely abandon the office while others will try to revert back to face-to-face all the time.”"

Financial advisors are used to talking to clients about saving and investing to raise a family, maybe start a business and eventually retire, but what about supporting their aging parents financially?

As Canadians live longer and long-term care costs continue to climb, advisors are also talking to clients about how to help pay for their parents’ living situations. The COVID-19 pandemic has also put many people out of work, including seniors who may fall short of their retirement goals. That could mean they need some financial backing from adult children – a reversal of roles from decades past.

Adult children looking at supporting their parents need to consider the impact on their own financial goals, says Rona Birenbaum, founder and certified financial planner at Caring for Clients, a fee-for-service financial planning firm in Toronto.

“Understanding what impact supporting another lifestyle will have on your own affairs is important. Often, these arrangements aren’t temporary. If you don’t make adjustments anywhere else in your financial planning, you could undermine your own future,” she says.

“Ask yourself if helping your parents financially for the next number of years, or even decades, means you’ll have less for yourself in retirement. If yes, is that okay with you?”

According to 2019 survey commissioned by FP Canada and Chartwell Retirement Residences, many Canadians expect that providing financial support to their elderly parents will have “a major impact on their personal finances.” Of more than 1,500 Canadians surveyed, 14 per cent expect that supporting their parents financially will cause them to postpone their retirement. Another 12 per cent said it will prevent them from paying off debt.

Ms. Birenbaum recommends “a triage approach” for members of the so-called “sandwich generation” – often people in their 40s, 50s and 60s who are supporting their kids and parents financially – for whom money is tight.

“If you feel responsible for everyone – your parents, yourself and your kids – you have to evaluate where the greatest need is and attack the situation in order of priority,” she says.

For example, adult children might need to choose between paying for a more expensive long-term care facility for their parents and spending extra to send a child to a university out of province.

Adult children will need to talk to their parents and ask them about what assets they have and their sources or income, such as a pension or income from a registered retirement income fund, says Loren Francis, vice-president and principal at HighView Financial Group in Oakville, Ont.

She says that information will help both the adult children and their parents figure out their different financial plans. However, she acknowledges that talk may not be easy for either side to initiate.

“A lot of people don’t talk about finances with their parents, and parents may not easily open up about it, but I think you need to ask the questions,” Ms. Francis says. “You need to make it a family affair.”

She also recommends these discussions begin sooner rather than later to give the adult children more time to plan for the additional expenses.

“If you can see yourself heading toward it, try to have the conversation early enough with your parents,” Ms. Francis says.

Advisors can often be used as conduits between adult children and their parents to help open up the financial conversation, says Sean Lasko, senior investment counsellor with Manulife Private Wealth in Toronto.

“If you can add in a third-party buffer to flush out the discussion, it works better,” he says.

Mr. Lasko says an advisor can also help families figure out if they qualify for tax credits, grants and other financial tools that may help reduce the financial impacts of caring for aging parents.

For example, an elderly parent using a wheelchair may qualify for home-renovation credits to make the house more accessible, or an adult child might be eligible for the Canada caregiver credit if they’re looking after a parent with a mental or physical impairment.

The FP Canada/Chartwell survey shows that only 28 per cent of Canadians are familiar with tax credits, grants and other financial tools available to help alleviate the financial impact of this support.

“There are lots of different avenues available and it’s imperative that [people] look into what’s available to them,” Mr. Lasko says.

He also recommends adult children make sure their parents have an updated power of attorney, will and health directives in place, which may be part of the financial plan.

For example, an adult child may pay for the cost of a long-term-care facility, but with the understanding that they will recover some or all of the costs from their parents’ estate.

Supporting a parent financially can also be considered an opportunity “to create meaning in your own life,” Ms. Birenbaum says, especially for adult children who believe family comes first.

“It would be nice if it didn’t cost dollars and cents, but we don’t always get to choose where our opportunities to express our love and to have an impact on somebody’s life comes from,” she says.

“One day, when your parents are no longer here, you may want you to be a position to say, ‘I’m proud of the son or daughter I was.’ It’s about finding the motivation in all of it, so that it doesn’t feel like a burden, but instead an opportunity to make a difference.”"

More financial advisors are working toward higher designations and credentials during the pandemic as they take advantage of a greater number of courses available online and extra time that they would’ve spent commuting to the office.

Sanjay Gupta, a financial securities advisor with Desjardins Financial Security Investments Inc. in Surrey, B.C., says COVID-19 has also provided him and other advisors an opportunity to think about how to further refine their skills.

“I strongly believe that the pandemic made everybody go soul-seeking, trying to find out what was missing,” he says.

Mr. Gupta already holds the certified financial planner (CFP) certification, which he earned in India, but decided to use this time to further upgrade his knowledge and add value to his practice by studying for an additional professional qualification.

Specifically, he opted for the new professional financial advisor designation, which Advocis, the Financial Advisors Association of Canada, launched earlier this year and focuses on practice development, technical knowledge, compliance and ethics.

Although starting a designation during the pandemic meant reading the course materials at home and connecting with the professor and other students virtually, Mr. Gupta says the format has worked well in terms of being both accessible and interactive.

After an initial drop in new registrations at the start of the COVID-19 lockdown, as advisors adapted to working from home and spent extra time calling concerned clients, there has subsequently been a marked increase in interest for several of Advocis’s online webinars, courses and designation programs, says Barbara Riddell, vice-president, education and membership, for the organization.

“Many advisors remain committed to professional development and [are] taking advantage of the time gained from potentially not having to commute or to go out to client meetings ... to further develop their knowledge and skill set,” she says.

In particular, Advocis noticed significant interest among advisors for the chartered life underwriter (CLU) designation, which is for individuals who wish to specialize in life insurance and estate planning. Specifically, there was an 84-per-cent increase in registrations, year-over-year, during the first six months of 2020. That growth shows advisors are using this time to prepare themselves professionally to serve clients with more complex situations, Ms. Riddell says.

In addition to offering the program’s modules remotely, Advocis was also able to implement an online proctoring solution for CLU candidates in the spring to replace the in-classroom exam, which allowed a several individuals to complete their final requirement.

Similarly, the ability to take courses remotely is one reason for the large number of registrations in FP Canada’s professional education program over the past few months. These are the courses that candidates for the CFP certification have to complete before they’re eligible to write the final exam.

The organization had to increase enrolment for the program in the spring to accommodate demand, after originally planning for 200 participants per monthly cohort, says Cary List, president and chief executive officer of FP Canada. In addition, it was targeting around 25 students a month in the summer, but FP Canada received more than 300 registrations in July and August.

“The numbers are just off the charts. We have more than 1,900 students enrolled in the professional education program right now, and that’s more than 1,500 since the pandemic hit,” he says.

The professional education program was fortuitously redesigned and launched in late 2019 as an e-learning model with direct instructor contact online, making it an easier process to begin in the current environment, Mr. List says.

Along with the convenience of e-learning, advisors are likely pursuing advanced designations at this time because they’re looking for ways differentiate themselves in a more difficult economy and aiming to become certified before legislation in certain provinces restricting the use of the title “financial planner” comes into effect, he says.

Although FP Canada postponed the June sitting of the CFP certification exam, Mr. List notes that registrations for the November exam are ahead of schedule, which suggests that many advisors are also using this time to prepare.

A similar scenario is taking place with respect to the chartered financial analyst (CFA) program, says Keith Waitt, senior head of professional learning with the CFA Institute in Charlottesville, Va. Although it’s too early to report trends regarding registration for the multi-year CFA program, as most applications are expected in the fall, he says that registrations for the CFA Institute’s first computer-based online exam in February 2021 is already 25-per-cent higher than expected at this stage.

Interest in the CFA Institute’s virtual courses and continuous professional learning credits has also been notably higher during the pandemic, he says, with CFA charterholders and other financial services professionals logging 36,000 credits, or hours of learning, in June compared with 12,000 to 15,000 credits during an average month.

“I think there’s a feeling that people do want to ... keep up with what’s going on,” Mr. Waitt says. “They’re very interested in making sure they’re staying at least equal, if not one step ahead of others in their field.”"

Direxion Work From Home ETF (WFH-A) is a play on remote work. Global X Telemedicine & Digital Health ETF (EDOC-Q) focuses on telehealth. And ETFMG Treatments, Testing and Advancements ETF (GERM-A) holds vaccine producers.

Welcome to the world of thematic exchange-traded funds (ETFs), in which recent offerings are aiming to ride a COVID-19 tailwind. Although hot trends may be enticing, investors need to tread carefully before buying niche ETFs to avoid overexposure to stocks they may already own – or wind up in money-losing funds.

The benefit of thematic ETFs is that they can give exposure to names not represented in broad market indexes and also reduce risk from owning a basket of stocks instead of making “a bet on a single company,” says Daniel Straus, vice-president of ETFs and financial products research at National Bank Financial Inc.

E-sports (electronic sports) and e-gaming is an emerging theme, but companies are often small and not in index ETFs, he says. If the theme resonates with investors, Evolve E-Gaming ETF (HERO-T) and Roundhill BITKRAFT Esports & Digital Entertainment ETF (NERD-A), are funds that could supplement a portfolio.

But investors need also to be mindful when choosing a thematic ETF because the stocks held within it could already be inside index ETFs that they hold, so they could become overconcentrated in certain names, Mr. Straus says.

Thematic ETFs are not part of National Bank’s model ETF portfolios because they tend to be expensive, while the best model for most investors’ portfolios is to own broad market index ETFs, he says. Specifically, thematic ETFs can charge a fee in the 0.40-to-0.60-per-cent range while passive index funds can cost close to zero.

Given that it’s common for thematic ETFs to be terminated if assets under management (AUM) and returns don’t gain traction, they shouldn’t be more than a low-single digit part of an ETF portfolio, or be considered “play money,” Mr. Straus suggests.

For example, a batch of ETFs with exposure to blockchain – a distributed ledger technology pioneered by cryptocurrencies – were listed in 2018. “But the theme was so nebulously defined that many portfolios were basically fintech plays,” he says.

Blockchain Technologies ETF (HBLK-T) holds pure blockchain plays as well as names such as Visa Inc. (V-N), Mastercard Inc. (MA-N), Overstock.com Inc. (OSTK-Q) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT-Q), all of which are found in broad indexes. It’s questionable as to whether the blockchain theme is driving returns, he says.

Coincapital STOXX Blockchain Patents Innovation ETF and FBC Digital Ledger Technology Adopters ETF delisted in less than a year. And Horizons Blockchain Technology & Hardware ETF morphed into Horizons Big Data & Hardware ETF (HBGD-T) as “blockchain may to be too narrow a theme,” Mr. Straus adds.

Technology-oriented thematic ETFs tend to be longer-term plays while themes such as infrastructure and airline travel are shorter term, he says. The fortunes of infrastructure stocks often depends on government spending.

Timing can affect an ETF’s popularity. Guggenheim Airline ETF and Direxion Airline Shares ETF delisted years ago, but U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS-A) has seen AUM surge in recent months to more than US$1-billion despite negative turns. That’s because some investors see it as economic recovery play, Mr. Straus says.

Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Chicago-based Morningstar Research Services LLC, says that investors should approach thematic ETFs with healthy skepticism because their track record is generally poor. “These products are designed much more with saleability in mind than investment merit.”

In Mr. Johnson’s survey of thematic mutual funds and ETFs launched globally before 2010, only 45 per cent of them survived until 2020 – and just one in four outperformed the MSCI World Index over that 10-year span, he says.

With thematic ETFs, investors are making a trifecta bet, Mr. Johnson says. “They’re betting that they are getting the theme right, the stocks right and valuations right. Your odds are slim when making these bets …albeit, they may pay off handsomely.”

ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK-A), formerly PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF, gathered AUM quickly shortly after listing in 2014 because of a cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. and other data breaches at the time. However, the ETF posted a loss in 2015 and has lagged the Morningstar U.S. technology index on annualized basis for five years to July 31.

“Often, these products are brought to market when valuations for the underlying stocks are fairly rich,” Mr. Johnson says.

AUM in thematic ETFs, a bull-market phenomenon, tripled to US$195-billion worldwide in 2019 from US$75-billion in 2017, he says, adding that robotics and automation were among the most popular themes. U.S.-listed Robo Global Robotics & Automation ETF (ROBO-A), though, lost money in the two calendar years after launching in 2013 and in 2018.

Cannabis ETFs have had a compelling story, but a lot of future growth proved to be priced into the stocks, he says. “Performance has been dismal.” In Canada, Evolve Marijuana ETF and Evolve U.S. Marijuana ETF delisted earlier this year.

Still, some niche ETFs have done “phenomenally well,” Mr. Johnson says. ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK-A), which focuses on disruptive innovation, has returned an annualized 32 per cent for five years to July 31. It had an early successful investment in bitcoin and benefited from a big holding in electric car maker Tesla Inc. (TSLA-Q), Mr. Johnson says.

Todd Rosenbluth, senior director of ETF and mutual fund research at New York-based CFRA Research, says thematic ETFs can make sense for investors seeking growth, but it depends on the ETF’s focus and investors’ time horizon and other investments.

He likes the newly launched Direxion Work From Home ETF over the medium term because he expects more employees will be working from home. And the ETF invests in four sub-themes, including remote communications, cybersecurity, project and document management and cloud technologies.

Story continues below advertisement

But some investors might see this ETF as a tactical play for the second half of this year, he says. “If there is a vaccine … and people start returning to work as normal, demand [for work-at-home products and services] may not be as strong.”

Some themes, such as cloud-computing, online video gaming and genomics, will likely play out for many years, although “they won’t always perform well, and there are going to be cycles,” Mr. Rosenbluth warns.

Investors who believe that cloud computing can play out over the next five years might hold a fund like Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU-Q) for the longer term, he says.

Still, there’s a caveat, he says: If a cloud computing ETF is an investor’s only exposure to technology, then it could mean missing out on other areas in this sector, such as semiconductors, that could outperform."

The first firms in the robo business in Canada have either reached their five-year anniversary or will shortly. Although still a small segment of the investment advice business, robos have established themselves as a strong option for people seeking low-cost help in building and maintaining investment portfolios built mainly with exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.

Five years is also long enough for investors to get meaningful information about the returns generated by the portfolios robo-advisers use for clients. The 2019-20 Globe and Mail Robo-Adviser Guide will help you assess the return information that firms provide on their website.

The guide also includes detailed comparisons of the fees each robo-adviser charges. If you’re wondering what to expect in future returns from a particular robo firm, give more weight to low fees than stellar past results.

Prepare for a challenge in comparing returns at robo-firms. Some report monthly returns for the model portfolios they use for clients, others quarterly. Some offer comprehensive annualized returns, which are easiest to use for comparison purposes, while others use combinations of annualized, cumulative and calendar-year results.

All too often, benchmark comparisons are left out of the reporting on model-portfolio returns. Without benchmarks, you can’t properly grade returns.

The Globe and Mail Robo-Adviser Guide helps you assess returns by including information on:

Whether model portfolio returns are available for prospective clients to look at on a firm’s website;

The use of benchmarks for context in assessing portfolio returns;

Whether returns are shown with portfolio management fees deducted, as well as the cost of the ETFs used in the portfolio.

As ever, the guide covers all the key aspects of choosing a robo-adviser. You’ll find comparative information on the provinces and territories they operate in, the kinds of accounts they offer, how personalized their business is, the cost of their advice and the fees attached to the ETFs they use. As you’ll see, costs can vary by hundreds of dollars per year, even thousands.

A few common features of the robos that appear the Globe guide:

Paperless account-opening with e-signature is standard, so there’s no need to fill out paper forms and send them in;

Commissions for buying and selling ETFs in your account are generally included in the portfolio-management fee. Exceptions: Nest Wealth charges as much as $9.99 per trade with a cap of $100 per year, per account; Smart Money Capital Management charges 1 cent per share with a $4 minimum per trade.

Almost all firms use pre-set model ETF portfolios that match your investing profile; an exception is Nest Wealth, which provides unique portfolios for each client;

All rebalance your portfolio periodically – selling hot ETFs and buying cold ones – to bring you back to your target mix of stocks and bonds;

Assets are generally held at held by third-party or related investment dealers that are members of the Canada Investor Protection Fund, which protects eligible account assets for up to $1-million against dealer insolvency.

You can interact with your robo firm via its website, by phone and, often, through some combination of secure e-mail, live online chat and Skype.

Tyrone Siu/Reuters

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday renewed criticism of British bank HSBC for its reported treatment of customers linked with the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, saying China was “bullying” Britain.

Mr. Pompeo cited reports of Hong Kong-based executives at Next Media being unable to access their HSBC bank accounts and said the bank was “maintaining accounts for individuals who have been sanctioned for denying freedom for Hong Kongers, while shutting accounts for those seeking freedom.”

“Free nations must ensure that corporate interests are not suborned by the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) to aid its political repression,” Mr. Pompeo said in a statement.

Next Media is the previous name of Next Digital, publisher of the Apple Daily newspaper and part-owned by democracy activist and media tycoon Jimmy Lai, who was arrested Aug. 10 under Hong Kong’s new security law.

While Next Digital’s business account remains open, HSBC has frozen Mr. Lai’s personal and private business accounts, as well as the personal and credit-card accounts of senior executive Mark Simon, Mr. Simon told Reuters.

The bank is still taking loan and credit-card payments from the accounts despite the block, Mr. Simon said.

A spokeswoman for London-based HSBC declined to comment on Mr. Pompeo’s remarks or the allegations made by Next Digital.

Britain’s Foreign & Commonwealth Office and China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Pompeo’s assertion that China was bullying Britain.

HSBC has in recent months faced mounting pressure on both sides of the Atlantic as it attempts to balance its need to maintain access to the Chinese market with appeasing lawmakers in the United States and Britain critical of Beijing’s handling of the democracy movement in Hong Kong.

Last month, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab reprimanded HSBC and other banks for supporting China’s new security law, saying the rights of the people of Hong Kong should not be sacrificed for bankers’ bonuses.

Senior British and U.S. politicians criticized HSBC and Standard Chartered in June after the banks backed China’s national security law for the territory.

Global banks have been examining whether their clients in Hong Kong have ties to the city’s pro-democracy movement, in an attempt to avoid getting caught in the crosshairs of the security law, Reuters reported last month.

Washington has criticized Beijing’s crackdown against pro-democracy opposition in the now Chinese-ruled city after a sweeping new security law imposed on Hong Kong on June 30 that was widely condemned by Western countries.

The Minster of Innovation, Science and Industry, Navdeep Bains, in May announced a new industry strategy council charged with providing advice on how the federal government can accelerate economic recovery from the deep COVID-19 recession. Chaired by former Desjardins CEO Monique Leroux, the council comprises respected private-sector leaders from across Canada.

An important initial task for council members is to get a sense of the industries that have the greatest impact in driving Canada’s $2.2-trillion economy.

To this end, the council should first examine the composition of Canada’s international exports to see what the global marketplace wants to buy from Canadian companies. Second, council members should also familiarize themselves with the value-added or real GDP-per-hour of employment contributions made by the various industries that make up the private-sector economy.

Starting with exports, the data underscore the continuing central role of natural resources in Canada’s export portfolio. In 2019, almost half of total Canadian exports – goods and services combined – were supplied by the energy, mining, agri-food and forest products industries. Looking just at merchandise exports, natural resources generate close to three-fifths of export receipts. Energy alone made up almost one-fifth of Canada’s total exports last year, with oil and natural gas accounting for the vast majority of the country’s energy-related export earnings.

Why pay attention to exports? Because by purchasing Canadian goods and services, international customers are signalling where Canada enjoys a global comparative advantage. For any industry involved in trade, the ability to sell profitably and at scale into global markets is the acid test of competitiveness.

Reviving exports must be a key part of Canada’s recovery plan. Quantitatively, the best opportunities to meaningfully increase export earnings lies not in small niche sectors, but rather in the industries that already loom large in Canada’s export mix. Natural-resource industries feature on this list, along with transportation equipment (14 per cent of total exports) and commercial services (11 per cent).

A second task for the council should be to look at the “value-added” per-hour contributions to the economy made by different industries. Tracking real GDP-per-unit of labour input by sector – that is, labour productivity – highlights which private-sector industries serve as outsized economic engines.

High-productivity industries typically feature the intensive use of physical, human and intangible capital, the adoption of advanced technologies and economies of scale. They are catalytic because they create demand for other goods and services across the rest of the economy.

Mining and oil and gas production generate – by far – the highest level of real GDP-per-hour of employment, followed by utilities, real estate, rental and leasing, information and cultural industries, and finance and insurance.

The COVID-19 pandemic has punched a significant hole in Canada’s economy. That hole needs filling, quickly. While some revival of employment and business activity is expected over the balance of 2020, the International Monetary Fund sees Canada suffering a staggering 8.4-per-cent fall in GDP this year – a much greater drop than in 2008-09.

Story continues below advertisement

One key to kick-starting the economy is to fire up the country’s big economic engines. This need not involve a heavy fiscal cost, but rather a tweaking of Canada’s tax and regulatory settings to ensure they are not too inefficient, antiquated and discouraging of private-sector investment and hiring – particularly in our leading industry sectors. Absent the horsepower provided by its major economic engines, Canada could struggle to recover, grow and compete in the aftermath of the terrible COVID-19 recession.

Some studies suggest that as much as 45 per cent of total employment is at risk of automation in Canada. But through pro-active policy, a reallocation of resources and a renewed vision for the work force, we can drastically improve our odds of securing an optimistic outcome. Here are three areas Canada should address now to lay the foundation for a successful transition into the future of work:

Bridge the skills gap and transition into a learning economy

Canada needs to invest in building accessible programs for Canadians to upgrade their skills throughout their entire working lives. There is a gap between the skills needed for the jobs of the future and the skills many Canadian employees have. In fact, a recent study by PWC suggested that 88 per cent of Canadian CEOs are worried about the availability of key skills in their industries in the future. According to the World Economic Forum, the future of work will require a “re-skilling revolution.” Re-skilling won’t be a one-time investment. As technology continues to advance, we will likely have to change occupations several times throughout our working lives, requiring us to learn new skills or upgrade our existing ones each time. As stated in a recent report by McKinsey & Company, education will become a lifelong endeavour.

As the Harvard Business Review recently noted, Singapore’s Skills Future Credit and Skills Development Levy provides an excellent example of government-facilitated re-skilling. The government provides Singaporeans of 25 years of age and older with the opportunity to receive the equivalent of $480 per year in their personal learning accounts for re-skilling. In addition, the government offers mid-career support and provides $480 to every Singaporean citizen aged 40 to 60 to access career transition programs. The goal is to “encourage individuals to take timely action to learn, re-skill and seize new career opportunities.”

Redesign social protection

Governments need to design economic social safety nets that reflect the current realities of the economy. The economy is quickly changing as organizations try to restructure their operations to be more flexible in response to changing technologies. Some organizations are likely to source more non-traditional forms of work, such as gig work – short-term, temporary, or independent contracts for one or a variety of employers – for both blue-collar and white-collar jobs. These forms of employment, however, often preclude access to social safety nets that come with standard forms of employment, such as access to sufficient employment insurance (EI) and maternity leave. These types of jobs also create more income volatility as workers move from contract to contract.

To ensure Canadians are financially protected, we need to redesign our social safety nets, such as EI, to match the changing needs of the work force. The current COVID-19 pandemic exposed these vulnerabilities. As the economy shut down, gig workers and self-employed individuals were unable to get financial support because they did not meet the EI eligibility requirements.

The Danish government’s recently-established Disruption Council is an example of a successful social safety net redesign. Through this council, new regulation has been passed that provides all Danes, regardless of their form of employment, a harmonized safety net and income security in the event that they lose their job or income. Moreover, under this new regulation, all taxable income can be used to earn unemployment benefits. The World Economic Forum recently praised the importance of these initiatives for “creating an innovative ecosystem” and “creating a sound labour market and proper social safety net.”

Reform primary, secondary, and post-secondary education

School curricula need to prepare students to thrive in the economies they will be entering. Our current education curricula and teaching formats are largely preparing youth for jobs of the past. Curriculums need to be redesigned to teach students ‘how to learn’ and how to solve problems instead of how to memorize facts and figures, something that artificial intelligence will increasingly do. Moreover, given that students in school today will likely hold approximately 17 jobs (65 per cent of which haven’t been invented yet), across five different industries, the curriculum needs to prioritize student agility and adaptability. Finally, as the World Economic Forum recommends, schools must teach the entirety of computer science disciplines as part of the core curriculum, including computational thinking and cybersecurity, not just coding. In order for Canada to secure a strong foothold in the future of work, we need to teach our students not just how to use technology, but how to create it.

Although the pace of technological innovation may be out of our control, how we choose to respond is not. Through optimal policy response, Canadians can walk into the future of protected, skilled, and positioned for success.

After a most difficult several months, Canadians are cautiously emerging from their COVID-19 isolation and confronting a struggling economy.

As governments assess the damage, they will consider how best to unleash stimulus budgets to jump-start economic activity.

Provincial and federal policy makers are looking for projects that are “shovel ready” and “shovel worthy” – that is, would provide much-need jobs and offer long-term value for the postpandemic economy.

Prudent investments in electricity infrastructure would result in a near-term boost in employment, and offer utility-bill savings and improved reliability for the power grid long into the future.

There is widespread recognition of the value an enhanced electricity grid can provide.

The International Monetary Fund and the International Energy Agency have urged governments to allocate stimulus funds to modernize their power grids. Such investments can improve efficiency and reduce costs in the system while adding resiliency and cutting emissions of greenhouse gases.

New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo recently proposed to accelerate approvals for transmission projects, including a 1,000-megawatt line from Quebec to bring power to New York City.

Electricity in Canada has historically been the subject of provincial protectionism. That approach can produce higher costs, and a less resilient and efficient system.

Several studies have concluded that consumers in Alberta and British Columbia would benefit from greater connection, but so far, there is little political support in Alberta for the idea.

Provinces in Atlantic Canada have committed to greater regional integration, and are identifying the most cost-effective and crucial transmission projects to accomplish that.

In Ontario, cross-border electricity trade has traditionally had only a modest impact on the market. Imports provide a lifeline to augment supply and provide resilience to the system at peak times, when it is under the most strain; exports typically occur when demand and wholesale prices are low.

Access to markets outside the province gives Ontario’s Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) greater flexibility in managing supply and demand. Additional cross-border transmission capacity can eliminate the need for more expensive options – such as building new generating facilities at home – while providing export revenues that can benefit all customers.

In its annual planning outlook earlier this year, the IESO said increasing the capability to import electricity would provide competitive power supply options that would help keep costs down.

One proposed project aimed at accomplishing those aims is the Lake Erie Connector, a 1,000-megawatt transmission line that would run along the bottom of the lake and connect Ontario to the largest electricity market in the world, the U.S. PJM system, which comprises 13 midwest and mid-Atlantic states.

According to a report that the energy consultant the Brattle Group prepared for the developers and submitted to the IESO, the Lake Erie Connector would generate significant savings for Ontarians. That would include more than $100-million a year (more than $4-billion over the life of the project) from opening a direct path for Ontario power exports during times of excess supply, importing low-cost power when needed and increasing the efficiency and flexibility of the system.

It would also deliver substantial short-term benefits: more than 380 direct jobs and $300-million in local economic benefits during construction, plus dozens of new, permanent jobs, the report said.

The project’s proponent is ITC, a subsidiary of Fortis Inc., a Canadian utility (headquartered in St. John’s), which would fund the cost of building the underwater transmission line.

There will be no cost to Ontario electricity customers or taxpayers during construction of the line, the report said. When the cross-border connection is completed, electricity consumer savings are expected to more than offset its cost, while the company would receive a rate of return consistent with regulated levels in Ontario.

The project has secured all necessary major permits, including approvals from regulators in the United States and Canada, who concluded it would be in the public interest.

But, before shovels can go into the ground, ITC requires a commitment from Ontario’s electricity system operator to use the line as designed to drive savings, increase efficiencies and serve future provincial electricity needs.

As governments look for job-creation opportunities that can attract private-sector investment, innovative electricity infrastructure such as the Lake Erie Connector offers numerous benefits.

The right projects provide a unique opportunity to bring savings, efficiency and flexibility to our electricity system for decades, while providing desperately needed economic stimulus right now.

Back in February, Toronto-based GMP Capital unveiled plans to swap its publicly traded stock for shares in partly owned subsidiary Richardson GMP. Winnipeg’s Richardson family is a significant shareholder of both companies, and the restructuring has been playing out over the past two years.

On Thursday, GMP Capital announced that, as part of the transaction, its shareholders will receive an additional 15 cents a share, or a total of $11.3-million, in a special dividend. It also said the Richardson clan will leave additional capital in the company to fund expansion by keeping $32.1-million invested in preferred shares, a holding the family was required to redeem.

In addition, GMP Capital changed the terms of the share swap with Richardson GMP’s owners, who include the firm’s 165 financial adviser teams. The company was planning to trade one GMP Capital share for every two shares of privately held Richardson GMP; now the ratio is one share for every 1.875 shares.

GMP Capital executives said the changes reflect a decline in Richardson GMP’s value after the sharp drop in interest rates in March, which cut into the profits it earns on its clients’ cash balances. In February, the transaction valued the entire franchise at $500-million; now the figure is $420-million.

“The revised terms to the previously announced transaction in February, 2020, strike what, we believe, is an appropriate balance taking into account the effects of the global pandemic, feedback raised by various stakeholders and retaining the appropriate level of capital to execute our long-term value creation strategy,” said Donald Wright, chair of the board at GMP Capital, in a news release.

Shareholders are scheduled to vote on the transaction on Oct. 6. If the deal is approved, the Richardson family will own approximately 40 per cent of Richardson GMP, the company’s financial advisers will have a 28.5-per-cent stake and existing GMP Capital shareholders will hold 31.4 per cent.

Last year, GMP Capital sold its capital markets business to St. Louis-based investment dealer Stifel Financial Corp., raising $42.2-million, in order to focus on managing money for high net worth individuals. Richardson GMP advisers currently oversee $29-billion of client assets, up from $23.5-billion when the stock market slumped in March.

“After a multiyear process to transform GMP, we can begin to capitalize on the considerable opportunities in the multitrillion-dollar wealth management industry in Canada,” said Kish Kapoor, interim president and chief executive of GMP Capital. He said that once the deal is completed, the company plans to recruit financial advisers from rival dealers, including the bank-owned firms, and will attempt to acquire small wealth management platforms.

“We believe, and the Richardson family believes, that the financial services ecosystem needs strong, high-quality independent firms,” Mr. Kapoor said. “Amongst many things, the health crisis has reminded us about the importance and demand for high-quality, face-to-face advice, especially during a period of volatile and uncertain markets.”

Fiscally conservative President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has resisted pressure to borrow to support the economy, while picking fights with businesses that have chilled the investment climate. But he insists Mexico is on the right track.

“We’re already recovering, workers are already being rehired and we’re going to get out of this without getting overindebted,” Mr. Lopez Obrador told a regular news conference.

The pandemic, which has infected 568,621 people and killed 61,450 in Mexico, has hit the Mexican economy harder than those of its Latin American peers “due to the health care system’s lack of preparation and the absence of stimulus measures to mitigate the effects on companies and families,” Mr. Coutino said.

By contrast, in Latin America’s largest economy, Brazil, GDP is forecast to have decreased by 9.4 per cent in the second quarter as President Jair Bolsonaro launched a fiscal spending program to deal with the impact of COVID-19.

In a positive sign, Mexican economic activity advanced 8.9 per cent in June from May, apparently confirming Mr. Lopez Obrador’s estimates the economy “hit bottom” in April and May. But the economy still contracted 13.2 per cent from June, 2019.

A breakdown of the adjusted quarterly GDP data showed primary activities slipped 2 per cent, secondary activities plummeted 23.4 per cent and tertiary activities contracted 15.1 per cent.

Primary activities include farming and fishing, secondary activities comprise manufacturing, mining and construction, and tertiary activities cover retail and the services sector.

Mexico’s economy is forecast to shrink by up to 10 per cent or more this year, in what the Finance Ministry and the central bank have said would be the worst recession since the 1930s.

Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Monday blocked Apple from shutting down Unreal Engine, but allowed the iPhone maker to keep “Fornite” out of its store until Epic meets Apple’s request to resubmit the app without the direct payment feature.

The judge’s reasoning was that Epic would not face “irreparable harm” by temporarily removing the direct payment feature while its case against Apple proceeds.

“We agree with Judge Gonzalez Rogers that ‘the sensible way to proceed’ is for Epic to comply with the App Store,” Apple said on Tuesday.

In a blog post Wednesday, Epic said it disagreed in principle with Apple’s payment rules and would not resubmit Fortnite to the App Store without the direct payment system.

“Their proposal is an invitation for Epic to collude with Apple to maintain their monopoly over in-app payments on iOS, suppressing free market competition and inflating prices,” Epic wrote in the post.

“As a matter of principle, we won’t participate in this scheme.”

Real estate is hot enough in the COVID-19 era that they’re feeling the heat in Saint John, N.B.

The average price of a house there jumped 9 per cent in July compared with a year earlier, a sign that the cost of buying a home is surging in cities both big and small. Home buyers are way more worried about missing out than they are about the as yet untallied effect of the pandemic on the economy, jobs, incomes and more.

The housing market looks like it entered a manic phase this summer, but let’s not fuss about economics and simply play it as it lies. You want a house and you worry that prices are running away from you – what to do?

Presenting seven housing markets across the country where a millennial or Gen Z buyer can buy an average-price home and still have money to save and enjoy: Lethbridge, Alta., Saskatoon, Winnipeg, St. John’s, and the New Brunswick trio of Saint John, Moncton and Fredericton. These cities were chosen because they appear on the Canadian Real Estate Association’s national price map and had average resale prices below $300,000 in July.

The pandemic has changed attitudes toward life and work in ways that should open your mind like never before to a move to a small city. First, there’s the trend of remote work. It’s proven – Zoom, Skype, Microsoft Teams and Google Drive can bridge the distance between home and work. You no longer have to convince your employer this is the case.

Second, there’s a new open-mindedness to moving out of the city. In Toronto, for example, there’s been a shift in emphasis from the inner-city neighborhoods and their 416 area code to the suburban 905 zone. Throughout the country, there’s also been a growing interest in buying country homes, cottages, cabins and camps.

It’s a logical next step to expand your search for affordable cities in which to buy a home and raise a family. Create a list of locations and feed each name into Realtor.ca to see what’s available.

Canadian home sales, prices hit record high in July as low mortgage rates drive buyers into market

Rob Carrick: A reality check for people looking to cure their pandemic blues by buying a cottage

A hike in demand is changing the cottage country real estate business

The national average resale price in July was $571,471. Bought with a 10-per-cent down payment and a 2-per-cent five-year fixed rate mortgage amortized over 25 years, this house would cost $2,265 a month (including premiums for mortgage default insurance).

In the Greater Toronto Area, with an average price of $880,400 in July, a comparable mortgage would cost $3,489. In nearby Hamilton, where people have been moving for a modest break on Toronto prices, the average cost of $687,000 produces a monthly mortgage payment of $2,723.

The average July price in Saint John was all of $202,297, which means a mortgage payment of $802 a month using the same variables as above. A 20-per-cent down payment would be easily in reach, which means you save the cost of mortgage insurance. Also, you can splurge a bit. On Realtor.ca earlier in the week, there was a $375,000 Saint John-area home on two acres close to the water.

A few things you can do with the savings from living in a small community:

Save more: for emergencies to come, retirement and your children’s postsecondary education.

If you need a big-city weekend, just do it. Worry less: Small mortgage payments take the edge off if your income flow is affected by events like the pandemic.

Now for the downside of small-town real estate markets. Smaller markets typically appreciate less than larger ones, which means you’ll need to strategize if your goal in the future is to move back to a major city. It might take a big promotion, career shift, inheritance or lottery win to sell your small-town house and move back to an urban house, or even a condo.

I’m from Toronto – I lived there for 31 years before moving to Ottawa. I know Toronto residents may complain about traffic and congestion, but they’re not notably open to moving outside the city or its surrounding constellation of smaller communities.

But whether you live in Toronto, Vancouver or new entrants to the club of expensive cities such as Montreal or Ottawa, an opportunity has appeared out of nowhere to buy a house in an affordable city far away from your work. Along with rising prices, that’s another feature of real estate in the COVID-19 era.

Since the pandemic began, Statistics Canada reports that Canadians spend far more time online than ever before. Activities that once required us to venture outside are now performed in front of a computer screen. Similarly, workers and employers seeking professional advice on their workplace rights are searching for that advice online. Increasingly, this is cause for concern.

Sales pitches

Internet-based marketing has become so pervasive that it can be hard to distinguish between a sales pitch and a genuine description of the law. Based on my observations, about half of the top search results produced by the leading search engines are advertisements, and half of those advertisements are paid for by companies looking to sell products or services that are not directly relevant. Companies or workers looking for legal advice can quickly be led far off into the wrong direction.

For example, when I searched for “employment standards act advice”, the first several results were paid advertisements that appeared to mimic government websites but were actually networks that claimed to put me in touch with a lawyer who would quickly answer my questions once I paid a small fee. The problem with these websites is that the “lawyers” who respond to such inquiries are generally not in Canada, and they may not even be lawyers at all. Be careful not to fall into these traps.

Advertising rules

Lawyers in Canada are governed by provincial regulatory bodies that place strict limits on how they are permitted to advertise online. For example, lawyers within Ontario are required to use a clear disclaimer when referring to past successes and they are forbidden from referring to awards or honours which were not credibly obtained by a legitimate third party. These rules are designed to protect consumers from being misled.

However, when researching for legal content online, it can be hard to detect an imposter. There is little stopping nonlawyers from advertising products or services, or even providing legal advice. These businesses dodge the regulatory requirements imposed on Canadian lawyers because they are not bound by them. For example, there is an international company offering workplace law advice to Canadian employers in Alberta, B.C. and Ontario. It does not actually consist of locally licensed lawyers because it does not follow any of the advertising rules in place. Without these safeguards, the general public has no way to verify that certain professional standards are met – and no one to complain to if not.

Jurisdictional issues

Each jurisdiction in Canada has its own unique employment standards legislation. There are also important distinctions between provincially and federally regulated employees (i.e. employees working in banking or telecommunications) that are critical to obtaining correct advice. Therefore, while it may be tempting to research a quick answer to “how much termination pay am I entitled to”, the correct answer first requires a proper understanding of the relevant jurisdictional framework and background terms of employment. When I speak with any prospective client, I have a comprehensive checklist of questions that I first need to have answered before I can confidently provide accurate advice.

Changes in the law

Even before COVID-19, workplace law was an extremely dynamic area, with constant changes to the law. However, since the pandemic began there is an almost-daily barrage of new developments and legislative amendments. Information posted online months or even weeks ago may no longer be precise. Search engine results are intended to be relevant – but they are not necessarily accurate.

The wrong question

Most internet searches for legal information are from individuals looking for a quick and simple answer to a legal problem they face. What is a constructive dismissal? How much severance pay should I receive? However, as any physician will tell you, the problem with self-diagnosis is that the underlying condition that you believe you have may be wrong. A temporary layoff may be a constructive dismissal for some employees. But if you are searching for whether it is a wrongful dismissal, which is a different legal concept, you may not receive the right answer.

Similarly, nuances in the law often require a more detailed explanation. There are actually separate and critically different meanings for severance pay in Canada. If you miss this distinction, your entire understanding of the concept will be wrong.

Unionized workers

Unionized employees cannot sue for wrongful dismissal but instead must file a grievance through their union. Without first qualifying this distinction, the answers to just about every online search for union workers will not be applicable to their matters.

The Internet is great for obtaining historical data points and a general direction of what to do next. But it is not a panacea for your workplace legal troubles. There is no substitute for actually conversing with a lawyer who can understand the nature of your problem and the dispute. Most law firms are now easily able to provide advice remotely.

As the COVID-19 pandemic started to spread, Tim Hortons reviewed its advertising plans and decided they no longer made sense as store closures, wide-scale layoffs and physical distancing upended life in Canada.

Instead, the coffee chain went back to the drawing board for two new ads. One informs customers how to buy doughnuts, double doubles and other products without going inside a restaurant, while the other follows Tim Hortons trucks delivering free coffee and doughnuts to essential workers.

“When we looked at what media we had committed to, we said: ’There’s a better way,“’ said Hope Bagozzi, chief marketing officer at Restaurant Brands International, the parent company for Tim Hortons.

Corporate spots acknowledging the pandemic have proliferated on TV breaks in recent weeks as companies grapple with how to fill previously purchased ad slots and what, if anything, they want to to say. How they proceed varies from brand to brand, but no one wants to risk appearing tone deaf during a national crisis.

“A lot of advertising — whether we want to admit it or not — is built on what has worked in the past,” said James Ansley, executive creative director at Grey Canada.

“It feels like right now, the rule book has been completely thrown out and we’re all trying to find our way through this.”

In the early days of the pandemic, Ansley saw companies do things that “felt a little bit ... lacking in meaning,” such as spacing out their logos in a nod to physical distancing. McDonald’s Brazil, for example, separated its golden arches mid-March, but later reversed the decision after facing criticism.

Companies are now trying to do something meaningful, said Ansley, by trying to help people feel safe and secure.

Utilitarian ads are one such attempt.

Tim Hortons released one in late March with an employee explaining drive-thrus are open and that app and delivery partners are accepting orders.

That ad was designed as “an accessibility spot” to answer questions the company was receiving from customers, said Bagozzi.

It’s notable that such ads aren’t geared toward selling products.

Ford Canada, for instance, created an ad thanking workers, and closing with information on how customers leasing or financing vehicles through its credit program could receive help.

BMO ran an ad thanking “all the front-liners for keeping our lives moving” without mentioning any banking services. A&W created an ad with a similar message of gratitude to its restaurant staff, essential workers and everyday Canadians “staying home to help stop the spread” that doesn’t show anything more than the fast-food chain’s spokesman, presumably in his own home, with a partial logo visible on the wall behind him.

The company wanted the gratitude to be authentic, genuine and dominant, said CEO Susan Senecal.

“That’s how we felt at that moment in time and we just wanted to express that completely,” she said. “We didn’t think anything more was necessary.”

A&W scrapped its original plans in this “very unusual set of circumstances,” Senecal said, and decided a message of thanks worked better.

The brands Ansley works with have “taken the foot off the pedal as far as pushing product,” which he thinks is the right move as staggering numbers of people apply for emergency government assistance.

More than one million jobs disappeared in March, according to Statistics Canada, and the unemployment rate increased 2.2 percentage points to 7.8 per cent.

“There’s a lot of people that are facing those realities,” Ansley said. “To go out with messaging that is tone deaf to that, I think, is completely wrong.”

Some brands have paused all their advertising in light of the pandemic, while others are trying to figure out if they have something to say, he said.

“I think really it’s just being true to your brand and your brand’s purpose.”

An example is a Dove Canada ad that presents a series of headshots of health-care workers, many of their faces showing indents from wearing their protective masks. The tagline “courage is beautiful” appears with the company’s logo and a list of donations the company is making to such workers.

The company’s long-runing “real beauty” campaign bills itself as a movement challenging traditional notions of attractiveness.

“That’s what makes it really powerful,” said Ansley. “It’s timely. It is a beautiful message. But most importantly, it just stays true to who they are as a brand.”

Similarly, Tim Hortons showcased its corporate values with the footage of real employees offering coffee and doughnuts to health-care workers, said Bagozzi.

The company didn’t know how it would use the footage when it first gathered it in March, she said, but after seeing the reaction decided to share it broadly.

“There was just such a nice reciprocal generosity and gratefulness that we were like, ‘Oh my gosh, this is so lovely. It’s so Canadian. We definitely want to share this.”

As the pandemic unfolds, it’s unclear what the future holds for advertising.

Tim Hortons ran a new ad recently offering a free pack of Timbits if customers spend at least $10. It’s intended as a nice gesture for families buying a meal, said Bagozzi.

The eatery is also looking at the activities it has planned for the rest of the year, especially the next few months, and asking what is most relevant and appropriate to be doing, she said.

The same can be said for A&W’s future advertising plans.

“As the situation continues to evolve, we’ll continue to think about what’s the most important thing to say next and try and do a good job of that,” said Senecal.

Both Oxford Properties Group, which is OneEleven’s landlord and long-time backer, and the federal-provincial agency confirmed Tuesday that Oxford would transfer OneEleven’s brand and intellectual property to OCE after talks that stretched back into the spring.

Technology news websites The Logic and Betakit reported the OneEleven takeover on Monday evening. Oxford spokesperson Daniel O’Donnell said Tuesday that the brand transfer would come at no cost, and that any financial terms would be for a lease agreement. Neither party confirmed the agreement’s value.

OneEleven was launched in 2013 as a non-profit and rose to become one of Canada’s most well-known startup hubs. The OCE, an agency that funds commercializing new technologies, was one of its original founders, alongside Ryerson University and the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System pension fund, better known as OMERS.

It became a for-profit startup hub in 2018, with its chief backers shifting to OMERS and Oxford Properties Group, the pension plan’s real estate wing.

But after the pandemic struck, OneEleven said in April that the prospect of future financial constraints was forcing the hub to shut down permanently, leaving dozens of startups uncertain about their future and 15 staff laid off – despite a staff proposal to keep the hub both open and cash-flow-positive, sources told The Globe and Mail in June.

Numerous suitors approached Oxford about the OneEleven brand, including Paramount Fine Foods founder Mohamad Fakih, who hoped to keep the startup hub private rather than government-funded, like many of Toronto’s other prominent startup organizations.

OCE has offices in the same Oxford building on Toronto’s Front Street West as OneEleven. Oxford said it would lease one floor to run OneEleven, as opposed to the two it operated on prior to the pandemic. Oxford plans to eventually tear the building down for a development called Union Park, but does not expect to break ground until 2023.

The government agency said in an e-mailed statement that it “looks forward to working closely with all of our partners to support the revitalization of an important element of the local tech community and we will share further news in the coming weeks.”

An OCE spokesperson said in June that the agency had been approached by several OneEleven companies “to explore opportunities to restore the community and maintain continuity.” Oxford said at the time that about a third of the hub’s desks for startups had been vacated since the April shutdown announcement.

OneEleven’s alumni include Canadian financial technology companies Wealthsimple Inc. and Borrowell Inc.

“Our involvement with OneEleven has always been driven by our desire to assist Toronto’s tech community and we are thankful a solution has been found to achieve this goal,” Mr. O’Donnell said in an e-mailed statement."

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro is taking some unprovoked swipes at Canada in a new book about U.S. President Donald Trump’s unconventional approach to foreign policy.

In CNN correspondent Jim Sciutto’s book, The Madman Theory: Trump Takes on the World, Navarro casts aspersions on Canada’s role in the U.S.-led multilateral NATO mission in Afghanistan.

He suggests Canada’s decade-long mission, which cost the lives of 158 Canadian soldiers, was motivated more by a desire to curry favour with the U.S. than to support the global fight against terrorism.

Story continues below advertisement

Navarro also accuses Canada of being out of step with “Trump world,” maintaining unfair barriers to foreign dairy imports and facilitating the dumping of Chinese products into U.S. markets.

In an interview with CTV News, former Obama-era defence secretary Leon Panetta rejected Navarro’s comments, saying they reflect more on the self-interests of the Trump administration than they do on Canada’s values.

It’s not the first time the outspoken Navarro has set his sights north of the border: following the fractious G7 summit in Quebec in 2018, he accused Justin Trudeau of “bad-faith diplomacy” and said there would be a “special place in hell” for the Prime Minister.

CTV obtained audio recordings of Navarro’s interviews with Sciutto, who was questioning the trade adviser about the Trump administration’s often-caustic approach to foreign relations when the subject of Canada’s mission in Afghanistan came up.

“Were they doing us a favour, or were they brought into the idea they needed to do that as part of the global effort against terrorists?” Navarro responds.

“I mean, if they were just doing us a favour, maybe their government should have been thrown out of office. I mean, every time that a Canadian shows up in a uniform, it’s doing us a favour? How’s that work?”

Navarro’s sentiments are largely a reflection of the Trump administration’s confrontational approach to Canada, particularly on matters of cross-border trade.

“What’s good about Canada?” Sciutto quotes him as saying, before he rattles off a list of grievances, including barriers to U.S. dairy products and a claim that the country serves as a transshipment point for Chinese products that would otherwise be subject to countervailing duties.

“It’s like this blue-eyed brother kind of thing,” he said. “It’s just Canada. It has its own national interests and self-interests.”

Panetta, who served as Barack Obama’s secretary of defence from 2011 to 2013, described Canada as having been “in the foxhole” with the U.S., as well as being a long-standing and trusted ally – unlike the U.S. itself in the Trump era.

“(Trump) sends a strong signal that he is not a trustworthy member or a trustworthy ally, and that raises a lot of concerns with regards to those strong alliances that are critical to peace and prosperity,” Panetta told CTV.

“Instead of an America that is a world leader, the rest of the world is looking at the United States as a rogue nation that cannot be trusted.”"

A new survey from Statistics Canada says that more than one-third of women in the northern territories have been subjected to unwanted sexual behaviour in a public place. The Canadian Press

More than one-third of women in Canada’s three northern territories have been subjected to unwelcome sexual attention in a public place, says a survey from Statistics Canada.

“Women are far more disproportionately targeted by these behaviours than men,” said statistician Adam Cotter.

The survey, released Wednesday, looks at what it calls unwanted sexual behaviours. That includes unwanted attention, sexual comments, close contact or online remarks.

Story continues below advertisement

That behaviour isn’t criminal, but the survey says it stems from the same cause as more violent harassment.

“These behaviours stem from social norms, structures and beliefs that are similar to those which underlie sexual assault,” it says.

“(The unwelcome behaviours) are still going to have considerable impact on whether or not you feel safe and comfortable in engaging in various parts of everyday life – just going out in public, walking on the streets, using libraries, bars, restaurants,” Cotter said.

The 2018 survey of 2,500 people in Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut found that 35 per cent of women and 16 per cent of men were on the receiving end of that behaviour in public spaces.

Roughly the same proportion had the same experience in their workplace, as did nearly one-quarter of women and 16 per cent of men online. About seven per cent of women reported harassment in all three places – a number three times higher than the figure for men.

Non-gender-conforming people reported even higher figures. About 43 per cent of LGBTQ respondents said they’d experienced inappropriate sexual behaviour.

More than 40 per cent of men and women who said they’d been targeted more than once said they had changed their behaviour as a result. The survey found 41 per cent of women and 42 per cent of men said they avoided certain people or situations.

Story continues below advertisement

Some said it damaged their mental health.

For both men and women, the most common perpetrator was a man acting alone.

“The vast majority of perpetrators are strangers,” said Cotter.

The study builds on earlier work done by Statistics Canada in the provinces. The findings were similar, Cotter said.

“We didn’t find any significant differences between the provinces and territories.”

Yukoners reported the highest rate of unwanted sexual attention. N.W.T. residents came next, followed by Nunavummiut.

Story continues below advertisement

Nunavut’s relatively low rate seems to contradict the territory’s nation-leading rates of sexual assault.

Cotter suggested that’s because Nunavut has a lower percentage of people living in the capital. While sexual assault is often committed by someone known to the victim, unwanted sexual attention is more often a product of the anonymity afforded by larger centres.

“Part of it is the nature of these kinds of behaviours compared to other kinds of sexual victimization,” he said.

Cotter said the study is part of a broader attempt by the agency to understand what makes cities feel safe, “making sure there’s data to support anecdotal evidence.”

Aja Mason of the Yukon Status of Women Council welcomed the agency’s attempt to reach beyond criminal behaviour in its research.

“What constitutes criminal activity … doesn’t necessarily equate to what is safety for people,” she said.

Story continues below advertisement

“We are deeply impacted by the actions and behaviours of people around us and this (report) creates some validity for people who describe experiencing a high amount of fear and anxiety.”

Mason said she wasn’t surprised by the high number of women who reported some form of unwanted attention. She said the report will back up her arguments for societal change.

“Reasoning that policy-makers use requires evidence. That’s what this is providing.”"

The 29-year-old Ukrainian-Afro-Indigenous woman fell from the 24th-floor balcony of her Toronto apartment on May 27 after police had been called to respond to a family disturbance, following a seizure that had left Korchinski-Paquet in distress.

The high-profile case has sparked protests against anti-Black racism and police conduct both in Toronto and across the country.

In Wisconsin: Violence escalated in the third night of protests in Kenosha over the Sunday police shooting of Jacob Blake. Two people were killed and one injured in an attack carried out by a white man who was caught on cellphone video opening fire in the middle of the street with a semi-automatic rifle.

Police have arrested 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse. According to witness accounts and video footage, police apparently let him walk past them with a rifle over his shoulder as members of the crowd were yelling for him to be arrested because he had shot people.

Ottawa announces up to $2-billion fund to safely reopen schools

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced up to $2-billion in funding for provinces and territories to help pay for new learning spaces, air ventilation, hand sanitation and personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies.

He made the announcement today in Toronto, home to Canada’s largest school district, with more than $760-million going to Ontario. The federal government is also spending an additional $112-million for schools in First Nations.

The money, which will flow in two instalments this fall and early next year, will be allocated based on the number of children aged four to 18 years old in each jurisdiction, with $2-million in base funding.

Moderna says its COVID-19 vaccine shows positive results among older adults

Biotech company Moderna, which secured a deal with Ottawa to provide its candidate COVID-19 vaccine to Canadians, has unveiled new data showing its vaccine has positive results among older adults.

The data found participants in two age groups, 56 to 70 and 71 and older, responded as well as younger adults, with similar levels of neutralizing antibodies. “That is very big news. Usually in vaccines, you lose neutralizing antibodies as you age because people have a weaker immune system” when they get older, Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a phone interview.

Separately, CanSino Biologics, one of China’s leading vaccine developers, is blaming domestic bureaucratic indecision for the delays in shipping supplies to Canada for a joint testing program that has now been abandoned.

Mark Carney joins Brookfield to lead environmental, socially-driven investing

The former governor of Canada’s and Britain’s central banks, Mark Carney, is joining Brookfield Asset Management, with a mandate to create funds focused on both generating profit and saving the planet.

How a bison herd is bringing hope to a Saskatchewan First Nation

Open this photo in gallery Michael Bell/The Globe and Mail

Alongside a dirt road in Muscowpetung Saulteaux Nation, community members drive up with lawn chairs in tow to sit outside a fenced-in enclosure and watch a herd of 15 bison gnaw on the prairie grass.

“Oh my god, they love it. They’re visiting them every evening,” James Pratt said about the excitement over the bison’s return to the Saulteaux community, nestled among the rolling Qu’Appelle valleys in Treaty 4 territory northeast of Regina.

Pratt is a community helper in Muscowpetung and part of a team that worked to bring back the stately creatures that once roamed the Saskatchewan prairies. The herd was initially bought to bolster food security during the pandemic, but the animals are providing the community with more than a stockpile of meat. They’re reconnecting community members with their past and revitalizing their culture. Read Willow Fiddler’s full story here.

A campus coalition at Canada’s largest university is urging the school to listen to its own expert research on COVID-19 and roll back its plan to reopen doors to students and staff in the fall.

In an online panel held earlier this week, the University of Toronto Faculty Association discussed what it described as the administration’s refusal to address health and safety concerns raised by staff and students despite the school’s high-profile health care advocacy work during the global pandemic.

Association president Terezia Zoric said she disagrees with the administration’s decision to hold in-person classes, arguing the move carries unnecessary risks for the entire university community.

“It is a complete lost opportunity for the university’s senior administration not to consult with their own in-house experts who are also being consulted by the World Health Organization and federal provincial governments,” Ms. Zoric said.

“They have developed a plan with very little input from the most expert people who work for them. It is beyond disappointing.”

Heather Boon, vice-provost of faculty and academic life, rejected the Association’s contention.

“We are following the public-health guidelines, which are in fact being informed by a wide variety of experts from many universities, including our own,” she said. “We are taking our own advice and are really proud that our scientists are a big part of that process.”

Faculty members also raised the issue of classroom ventilation, saying inadequate measures on that front risk turning faculty buildings into new breeding grounds for the virus.

“What will happen when the weather gets too cold to open windows? Does the ventilation in the room exchange the air or not? You can be in a very large room with poor ventilation and it could be very dangerous as the virus hangs in the air for hours,” Ms. Zoric said.

Ms. Boon said the University of Toronto is following guidelines for ventilation and will determine what activities will transpire in each room to limit the spread on school grounds.

“The ventilation system is designed to have far more people in the room than what we are putting in and they will be wearing masks while being physically distanced,” she said.

A petition launched last month by CUPE 3902, a union representing some of the university’s faculty members, previously called on the school to re-think its plans for on-campus classes.

Academic workers, library staff, graduate assistants and administrative employees were among the more than 6,600 people who had signed the petition as of Wednesday morning.

CUPE 3902 chair Amy Conwell said her organization wants to see the return to school done right and in good faith.

“We want to see resumed academic activity in the fall that considers the safety of everyone,” she said.

Ms. Conwell said her union believes the reason the school is insisting on in-person learning is because it will be hard to justify full tuition fees while delivering classes primarily online.

“We have raised so many safety concerns with them its hard to understand that this is anything other than profit over people.”

Ms. Boon contends this is not the case.

“There are reasons to bring people to campus,” Ms. Boon said. “There are some things that can only be taught in-person, and we also have students that don’t have access to reliable internet or a suitable place to study. We are very conscious of the inequity that can be created if we only have online classes.”"

Everyone who fled from a wildfire south of Penticton, B.C., is now allowed to return home.

The Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen says an evacuation order that covered 319 properties has been rescinded and downgraded to an evacuation alert, meaning residents should still be prepared to leave again if required.

The BC Wildfire Service says the blaze has died down to a smouldering ground fire and is no longer out of control.

It has reclassified the fire as “held,” which means that with the resources committed to it, it’s unlikely to spread under prevailing and forecasted conditions.

Evacuation alerts for more than 3,700 other properties were lifted Monday and Tuesday.

The Canadian Press

After a three-month investigation, Ontario’s police watchdog has concluded there are no reasonable grounds to lay criminal charges against any of the six Toronto Police officers who were present for the death of Regis Korchinski-Paquet.

Ms. Korchinski-Paquet, a 29-year-old Ukrainian-Afro-Indigenous woman, fell from the 24th floor balcony of her Toronto apartment on May 27, after police had been called to respond to a family disturbance, following a seizure that had left Ms. Korchinski-Paquet in distress.

The high-profile case has sparked protests against anti-Black racism and police conduct both in Toronto and across the country.

In his decision Wednesday, Joseph Martino, director of Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit — which probes all cases involving police that end in serious injury or death or allegations of sexual assault — acknowledged the “incredible public interest and attention” that the case has received, and noted that the SIU had notified Ms. Korchinski-Paquet’s family as well as the Toronto Police Service of their decision.

“First and foremost, it must be acknowledged that Ms. Korchinski-Paquet’s death, and others in recent months, has raised important issues of social consequence. On the heels of the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis, and the protest movement it has spawned across the United States, Canada and elsewhere, there is increased scrutiny of our society’s policing of members of the Indigenous and Black communities. Ms. Korchinski-Paquet was a member of both communities,” Mr. Martino wrote in his decision.

‘Regis’s legacy lives on:’ Walk and Public memorial for Regis Korchinski-Paquet

Former SIU director has seen evidence to support a criminal charge in death of Regis Korchinski-Paquet

“I accept that systemic racism exists and continues to challenge the relationship between racialized communities and the institutions of our justice system, just as it does in other sectors of society. Our leaders have acknowledged it, as have our laws.”

But he stressed that his unit’s mandate is a narrow one: to determine whether any of the officers committed a criminal offence in connection with her death.

“It was not to conduct a broad inquiry into systemic discrimination on the part of the police service,” he wrote. “There are other forums with the institutional mandates and expertise to conduct those inquiries.”

The report noted that six Toronto Police officers had been in and around Ms. Korchinski-Paquet’s apartment at the time of her death.

One of those officers, who had “the most dealings” with her, was investigated and interviewed as a subject officer. In addition to the other officers, 15 civilian witnesses including Ms. Korchinski-Paquet’s mother and brother, who were home at the time, as well as her father, whom Ms. Korchinski-Paquet had spoken with just moments before she fell, were also interviewed.

According to the SIU report, police were responding to multiple 911 calls about a domestic disturbance when they arrived at Ms. Korchinski-Paquet’s family’s apartment around 5:15 p.m. that evening.

One of those calls was made by Ms. Korchinski-Paquet herself, who reported that she’d been assaulted by her mother and brother, and that knives were involved. Her brother also called 911, saying that his sister had attacked him with knives. A third call was made by their mother, who said her daughter and son were fighting and that punches and bottles were thrown and she wanted them out.

The fight began after Ms. Korchinski-Paquet, who had epilepsy and had suffered seizures earlier in the day, had argued with her brother over the volume of the television in the living room.

When police arrived, they separated the siblings and their mother in the hallway. Ms. Korchinski-Paquet’s mother told police she wanted her daughter to be taken to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.

When Ms. Korchinski-Paquet said she had to go to the bathroom, she was escorted back into the apartment by a police officer.

She called her father from the bathroom.

When she came out, a police officer asked her to speak with a paramedic, given her seizure earlier in the day. She refused, and headed to the balcony. The police officer told her to come back inside, and attempted to open the door, but Ms. Korchinski-Paquet held it shut.

“Very quickly,” the report says, “Ms. Korchinski-Paquet scaled the balcony railing and the [police officer] lost sight of her. At about this time, [her mother] asked, “What is she doing?”

A police officer responded that she was “jumping balconies.”

Her mother and brother said that wasn’t possible, because the balcony is blocked off with mesh.

Two police officers went to knock on the apartment next door, but nobody answered. They returned, and when they looked down from Ms. Korchinski-Paquet’s balcony, saw that she had fallen to the ground below. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

In conclusion, Mr. Martino — who said his investigators looked both at whether police overstepped their authority, and whether they did enough — said the investigation did not warrant any criminal charges against any of the police officers involved.

Story continues below advertisement

While he said the investigation “turned up no indications of overt racism being brought to bear by any of the involved officers,” he added that “this is not to suggest that questions of race were entirely absent in the encounter.”

For example, he said that there was evidence that Mr. Korchinski-Paquet “attempted to court favour with the police at one point by informing them that her father was coming and he was “white”.

“The officers, it must be noted, indicated that they did not hear any such words,” Mr. Martino wrote.

“Needless to say, if true, the utterance is a testament to the importance of efforts to build and nurture trust in the relationship between the police and members of the Black and Indigenous communities.”

Ms. Korchinski-Paquet’s family and their lawyer are expected to respond to the report later today.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney didn’t hint at what Thursday’s economic update for the province will contain as much as he issued a foreboding warning.

In speaking with reporters Tuesday as he unveiled a small cabinet shuffle, Mr. Kenney said a “great fiscal reckoning” is coming.

Story continues below advertisement

“This is going to be the biggest deficit in the history of Alberta by a country mile,” the premier said. Thursday’s first-quarter update reveals a deficit larger than $20-billion, a galaxy away from the $6.8-billion deficit his government had forecast for the 2020-2021 fiscal year when it introduced the budget in February, before the coronavirus shuttered scores of businesses and put thousands of Canadians out of work.

Trevor Tombe, an economist at the University of Calgary, expects Thursday’s update will put the deficit between 7 per cent and 8 per cent of GDP, up from the February forecast of 1.9 per cent. The previous record, he noted, was 6.8 per cent in 1986 and it never exceeded 4 per cent of GDP during the Great Depression.

The balance-sheet misery is being felt across the country. Last month, the federal government announced its deficit would be $343.2-billion. That one-year deficit figure is nearly the same size as total federal spending in a normal year. Ahead of the pandemic, Mr. Morneau had projected a deficit of $28.1-billion in the fiscal year that started on April 1.

British Columbia is now forecasting a $12.5-billion deficit, as compared to the $227-million surplus that it had forecast before the pandemic hit with force.

But provincial finance minister Carole James said last month she is not looking at any measures, including tax hikes, to begin to trim the “staggering” deficit because the workers, families and others in British Columbia need the support programs now under way.

“This is not the time to be pulling back and to be cutting programs and services that are critical for economic recovery for people,” Ms. James said.

The Conference Board of Canada said Monday that B.C. is among the provinces best suited for an economic recovery.

Story continues below advertisement

Alberta isn’t in that category. The Conference Board report forecast the province will be most heavily hit in Canada, with an 11 per contraction in its GDP, a result of a double whammy of the pandemic and collapsed oil prices. Consumer confidence has faltered as businesses plow money into debts accumulated during the shutdown. The Conference Board noted that for Alberta’s oilsands mines, stopping production is costly because there are fixed, ongoing expenses that aren’t covered by current oil prices.

Alberta is projected to bounce back in 2021, potentially helped along by bolstered oil prices as a result of increased demand for transport and travel, which has been restricted by the pandemic.

As part of his plan to address the situation, Mr. Kenney shuffled his cabinet slightly on Tuesday. He promoted Kaycee Madu to Justice Minister. Mr. Madu, a lawyer from Nigeria, became the first Black person in Canada to serve as a provincial justice minister. Tracy Allard, who represents Grande Prairie, replaces Mr. Madu as Minister of Municipal Affairs, a portfolio that will require careful handling as municipalities struggle with shrunken tax revenue from businesses that are in financial peril. Doug Schweitzer moves from Justice to become Minister of Jobs, Economy and Innovation.

Mr. Kenney left three major portfolios rocked by the COVID-19 pandemic untouched: Tyler Shandro remains Alberta’s Minister of Health, leading UCP’s contentious fight with physicians over pay and strategy to reduce waiting lists by increasing the number private clinics performing surgeries paid for by the government; Adriana LaGrange continues as Education Minister, overseeing the reopening of primary and secondary schools while trying to cut costs; and Travis Toews is still in charge of the Finance Ministry.

AROUND THE WEST

B.C. OVERDOSES CONTINUE TO CLIMB: For the third consecutive month, almost as many people have died across British Columbia from overdosing on an illicit drug as all those who have died in B.C. during the entire coronavirus pandemic. B.C.‘s top health officials continue to urge that the supply of these toxic substances be replaced with safe, regulated alternatives. B.C.‘s small “safe supply” program started giving users pharmaceutical alternatives to deadly street drugs in March and is expanding the list of medications offered and making these prescriptions much easier to obtain. However, a reluctance by many physicians and nurse practitioners to prescribe, in part because of liability concerns, means people who could benefit from these regulated medications have no way of accessing them.

ALBERTA BREWERIES EXPAND TO FOOD: With a penchant for brewing and rarely for food, it’s no surprise that most newer breweries don’t try to operate their own kitchens. Instead, they leave it to local restaurateurs who, admittedly, can do it much better. Two weeks ago A1 Burrito – owned by Thank You Hospitality (A1 Bodega, Native Tongues, Calcutta Cricket Club) – changed all that by opening up inside a big red shipping container inside the brewery itself. Burritos, quesadillas and freshly-made cinnamon sugar doughnuts: sustenance can now be found. The neighbouring brewery, Cold Garden Beverage Company, was also in a similar boat until several months ago when it partnered with chef Alli Said of Mikey’s on 12th to create from-scratch salsas and chips for people to snack on while at the brewery.

MASK EXEMPTION CARDS: Shortly after Edmonton’s mask bylaw took effect at the beginning of August, requiring people to cover their faces in indoor public spaces to curb the spread of COVID-19, the city attempted to help people who are exempt for medical or other reasons by providing official exemption cards. The program was shut down within days amid concerns that the cards were being abused by people with no legitimate reason not to follow the bylaw. Roughly 6,000 cards were handed out. Like Edmonton, jurisdictions across Canada that have imposed mask requirements have also carved out exemptions, including for people with medical reasons or reduced mobility that make it difficult to wear face coverings.

FALL FAIRS ADJUST TO COVID: These annual events, marked by amusement park rides and indulgent food, range from small-town country fairs to big-city exhibitions, but all are rooted in showcasing local agriculture and industry, bringing thousands to millions of dollars to local economies across Canada. Since the pandemic forced fairs and exhibitions to shut down with little government support, their survival is in question. Public-health authorities have said the earliest people could crowd into concert stadiums and amusement parks would be 2021. But as many as one-third of fairs could permanently close unless they receive financial support from governments, according to Christina Franc, the executive director of the Canadian Association of Fairs and Exhibitions.

SEXUAL EXPLOITATION CHARGES STAYED: A charge of sexual exploitation against the former manager of a girls minor hockey team in Saskatchewan has been stayed. The trial for Jamie Engen had been slated to begin Tuesday, but court records show the Crown stayed the charge last week. Engen, who was charged in October and managed the Prince Albert Northern Bears of the Saskatchewan Female U18 Hockey League, pleaded not guilty in December. When a charge is stayed by the courts, the Crown have up to one year to reactivate it. Crown lawyer Kristen Hubbard could not be reached for comment on Monday, so the exact reasons for the stay of proceedings were not immediately clear.

CALGARY-EDMONTON HYPERLOOP: A hyperloop that could transport passengers in levitating tubes at the speed of a jet between Calgary and Edmonton is being backed by the Alberta government. The corridor has been at the centre of a years-long debate about how to connect Alberta’s two largest cities amid cutbacks on transportation spending. After vying for government support since 2017, Toronto-based startup TransPod has signed a memorandum of understanding with the government to study the potential of a high-speed hyperloop system and help it attract investors. Unlike a train on a track, the magnetically-levitated pods would race at jet-like speeds of 1,000 kilometres an hour to transport passengers and cargo between Calgary and Edmonton in 30 minutes, according to the startup.

MANITOBA MANDATES MASKS: The Manitoba government is requiring more people to use masks as COVID-19 numbers continue to rise. Starting Sept. 1, all visitors to health care facilities will be required to wear non-medical masks upon entering. “As we move towards the fall, additional proactive and preventative measures are needed to ensure the risk of exposure to this virus is minimized for patients and our dedicated front-line clinical staff who care for them,” Health Minister Cameron Friesen said in a release Monday. The order came on the same day that new rules, announced last week, took effect in the Prairie Mountain health region, which covers much of western Manitoba including Brandon, the province’s second-largest city.

JASPER BUS LAWSUIT: A class-action lawsuit alleging the defendants acted recklessly and unreasonably has been filed against the operators of a tour bus involved in a fatal rollover at Jasper National Park’s Columbia Icefield. Three people were killed and 14 others suffered life-threatening injuries on July 18 when the red-and-white all-terrain Ice Explorer lost control while carrying passengers on the road to the Athabasca Glacier. The bus rolled about 50 metres down a moraine embankment before coming to rest on its roof. The bus was carrying 27 people. Named in the statement of claim filed in Calgary are Brewster Travel Canada Inc., Viad Corp, Glacier Park Inc., Brewster Inc., Brewster Tours, Banff-Jasper Collection Holding Corp. and the unidentified driver of the coach.

PENTICTON, B.C. WILDFIRES: A wildfire south of Penticton, B.C., is dying down, allowing firefighting crews to move around its flanks Tuesday. The BC Wildfire Service says the fire, which has scorched more than 20 square kilometres of land on the east side of Skaha Lake and destroyed one home since last week, is now classified as Rank 1 on a scale of six. Rank 1 covers smouldering ground fires with no open flames and white smoke that can be attacked directly by ground crews using hand tools, pumps and hoses. The wildfire service says 217 firefighters are on-site with support from a dozen helicopters and four water tenders.

MANITOBA RECORD COVID CASES: Manitoba shattered its single-day record for new COVID-19 cases on Sunday, most of which health officials said were from communal-living settings. The province’s Chief Public Health Officer, Brent Roussin, told a news conference that 47 of Sunday’s new cases are in communal-living settings. The province says that preliminary investigation shows that most of the new cases are a result of extra testing that’s being done because of known clusters in those settings in the Prairie Mountain health region in western Manitoba. Health Minister Cameron Friesen told the news conference that Hutterite communities are being co-operative with testing and are working with public health officials to try to limit the spread of the virus.

ALBERTA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: Alberta’s Health Minister says he hasn’t given up on resolving a bitter dispute with the province’s doctors that developed after he tore up their master pay agreement. Tyler Shandro said Monday that he is happy to continue talking with the Alberta Medical Association and met with president Dr. Christine Molnar for an extended period last week. He said there is definitely “an uncertainty” in the relationship between the association and the provincial government.

Roderica Ribbonleg had big plans to make her family proud and her first milestone was her high-school graduation.

Her cousin, Tracey D’Or, says the 15-year-old from a remote northern Alberta First Nation was determined to attend university.

That bright future was stolen when Roderica was killed and her body discarded in a forested area near John D’Or Prairie, Alta., in July.

“She was just a child at heart,” Ms. D’Or says. “She didn’t even get to experience life yet.”

Jason Alec Tallcree, 35, also of John D’Or Prairie, was charged with first-degree murder Aug. 19. He made his first court appearance on Monday and his next court date is Oct. 5.

John D’Or Prairie is one of three remote communities that make up the Little Red River Cree Nation, more than 750 kilometres north of Edmonton. John D’Or, Fox Lake and Garden River have about 5,500 members between them.

Many people are asking how a young innocent life could be taken within the boundaries of their own community, Ms. D’Or says. Most people knew the 5-foot-2 teen with shoulder-length black hair, brown eyes and a big, bright smile full of braces. Ms. D’Or says the girl’s quick wit and insatiable sense of humour used to make many people laugh.

Roderica was living in Garden River to attend Sister Gloria School, where Ms. D’Or works as an educational assistant. Ms. D’Or is also sister-in-law to the girl’s mother.

“She was a very helpful young lady in our school. She was always helping out in the kitchen, setting up tables for lunch hour.”

The teenager would often visit her cousin’s classroom during breaks. She would talk about things that made her happy and sad – teenage love, friendships and frustrations.

Ms. D’Or says she will always remember the huge smile crossing Roderica’s face when she talked about inviting all her friends to her graduation.

“She said she was going to graduate and move out of our reserve to go to a city school to make something of herself and do something that her family could be proud of,” Ms. D’Or says. “She had plans.”

In her spare time, Roderica was always doing artwork or out walking with her friends.

When the pandemic hit in the spring, her school was forced to shut down, so Roderica moved home to John D’Or Prairie. Ms. D’Or says she often wonders what would have been different if her teen cousin had stayed.

Roderica vanished on July 5.

All three communities began to look for her. People started going door to door. Eventually, ground searches began. Ms. D’Or says everyone was holding onto hope that the girl would be found safe.

But terrible news came quickly. RCMP received a report of clothing being found in a forested area. Police said remains were found nearby on July 12.

An autopsy confirmed it was Roderica.

Chief Conroy Sewepagaham said in a video posted on Facebook a few days later that he had encouraged investigators to leave no stone unturned. Garden River and John D’Or Prairie went into lockdown for many days to ensure a thorough investigation.

The Chief also discouraged animosity between people in the remote communities.

“The last thing we want is vigilante justice,” he said. “I understand a lot of people are saddened by the loss of our tiny home fire.”

Ms. D’Or says she doesn’t personally know the man accused in Roderica’s death, but she has seen him around. Most people know his history, she says.

Story continues below advertisement

In 2014, Mr. Tallcree was charged with second-degree murder and interfering with a dead body in the death of his common-law partner Marlena Loonskin.

Court records show the charges were stayed in 2015, two weeks before Mr. Tallcree was to have a hearing aimed at determining whether there was enough evidence to hold a trial.

Ms. D’Or says she was involved in the search for Ms. Loonskin six years ago. The young mother’s body was found in a wooded area near her home.

Both tragedies are almost too much to comprehend, Ms. D’Or says. She really worries for the young people who will be going back to school knowing their classmate was killed. Ms. D’Or says many don’t know how to talk about it so they just bottle it up inside.

A video being shared on social media to honour Roderica shows her with friends at school, eating pizza, fishing and driving around. Messages from friends say she will be missed.

Ms. D’Or says walking through the school’s hallways is not going to be the same without her little cousin’s daily classroom visit.

“She was a great spirit,” she says.

“She didn’t deserve to go this way. She wasn’t ready … It wasn’t her time.”

Two years after Ottawa passed a law promising to end solitary confinement, prison watchdogs and human-rights advocates says that the federal government, along with the Ontario government, have not fulfilled its own legally binding commitments.

In a court document filed yesterday, the Ontario Human Rights Commission accuses the province of not following through on its promise to make solitary confinement a measure of last resort for inmates with mental-health disabilities, and enforce a 15-day limit for everyone else. These commitments by the province were first made in 2013 and restated in 2018.

At the federal level, the chair of a government panel monitoring the ending of solitary confinement in federal prisons says the panel members’ terms are ending and they still have not received information on whether the practice is still in widespread use.

In separate legal challenges last year, the courts of appeal in British Columbia and Ontario ruled that aspects of solitary confinement were cruel and unusual punishment, prohibited by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

CanSino blames Chinese officials for abandonment of joint vaccine program with Canada

Bureaucratic indecision in China is being blamed for delays in a joint vaccine testing program between China and Canada that has since been abandoned.

In May, CanSino Biologics agreed to bring its Ad5-nCoV vaccine candidate to Canada for testing through a partnership with the National Research Council. However, CanSino chairman and CEO Dr. Xuefeng Yu says that some divisions of the Chinese government were unclear about whether the vaccine should “go to global trials or how to handle it.”

Before its cancellation, the program was a rare sign of co-operation between the two countries in the midst of legal and diplomatic frictions. Ottawa says it is focusing on working with other partners to develop a vaccine.

Five deaths a day in B.C. from opioid overdoses; rate eclipses COVID-19

B.C. has reported yet another grim month of overdose deaths as the province struggles to contain this public-health crisis. For the third month in a row, almost as many people died from overdosing on an illicit drug as all those who have died during the entire COVID-19 pandemic in the province. In July, 175 people died from illicit drug overdoses.

B.C.‘s top health officials agreed that shame and stigma associated with substance use is leaving people with no options other than the risky act of consuming street drugs alone. The province says it is working as fast as it can on a solution, including replacing the supply of toxic substances with safe, regulated alternatives.

Since the start of the pandemic, 203 people have died from COVID-19 in B.C., while nearly 6,000 people have died of illicit drug overdoses in the province since 2016. This makes illicit drugs the biggest killer in B.C. next to other illnesses.

His appeal is a direct, pragmatic approach to tough issues, one rooted in substance over style.”

Navalny’s poisoning points to a new desperation in Putin’s world

Doug Saunders: “In short, Vladimir Putin appears desperate. If he did indeed order the poisoning of Mr. Navalny, then the timing suggests he has fully abandoned the appearance of democracy and is lashing out in a panicked power grab. If he didn’t, then it suggests the Russian President’s iron-fisted control over his country’s forces is fraying, along with so much in Russia today. Either way, Mr. Navalny’s collapse suggests something is very wrong in Mr. Putin’s world.”

MOMENT IN TIME: August 26, 1959

British Motor Company launches the Mini

When fuel prices spiked after the Suez Crisis in 1956, the head of the British Motor Company (BMC) assigned his top engineer to develop a fuel-efficient car. Using a transverse engine, front-wheel drive and smaller, pushed-out wheels, the Mini would save on gas by trimming back on space, weight and costs. A radio, window rollers and seat belts were omitted, though it did include an ashtray. The project was kept secret for 2½ years, after which it was approved for production. The first models rolled off the assembly line in early 1959, and the Mark I Mini was unveiled to the press in August. In its first year, the Mini overtook the Morris Minor as BMC’s best-selling car. The Beatles, Mick Jagger, Steve McQueen and Prince Charles all drove the popular model. John Cooper, race-car designer and owner of the Cooper Car Company, then collaborated with Mini engineer Alec Issigonis in 1961 to develop a sports model – the Mini Cooper. BMC’s Mini production ended in 2000, but under BMW ownership in 2002, the Mini Cooper was updated and reintroduced in the U.S. – Vanessa Quon

The Canadian Press

Alberta will post the largest deficit in its history when it provides an economic update later this week, Premier Jason Kenney says, warning that a “great fiscal reckoning” is coming.

Mr. Kenney’s declarations came as part of a small cabinet shuffle that he said will help steer the province through its recovery from the economic devastation of the coronavirus and slumping energy prices. He compared Tracy Allard, incoming Minister of Municipal Affairs, to the U.K.’s Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister known for her distaste for large governments and taxes.

On Thursday, Alberta will release a first-quarter update with a revised deficit projection for 2020-2021 of more than $20-billion, Mr. Kenney told reporters.

“This is going to be the biggest deficit in the history of Alberta by a country mile,” the Premier said on Tuesday. “There is a great fiscal reckoning on the horizon.”

In February, the United Conservative Party government forecast a deficit of $6.8-billion for the 2020-2021 fiscal year. That was before the coronavirus caused scores of businesses to be shuttered and put thousands of people out of work. Trevor Tombe, an economist at the University of Calgary, said he expects Thursday’s update will put the deficit at 7 per cent to 8 per cent of GDP, up from the February forecast of 1.9 per cent. The previous record, he noted, was 6.8 per cent in 1986, and even during the Great Depression, the deficit never exceeded 4 per cent of GDP.

In shuffling his cabinet, Mr. Kenney promoted Kaycee Madu to Justice Minister. Mr. Madu, a lawyer from Nigeria who had served as municipal affairs minister, is the first Black person in Canada to become a provincial justice minister, the Premier noted. He represents Edmonton-South.

Ms. Allard, who represents an area rich in energy, has an “iron fist in a velvet glove,” and that will help in her new role, Mr. Kenney said.

The provincial government has clashed with its municipal counterparts over money. Alberta, for example, last year demanded rural municipalities cut taxes for oil and gas firms, which created a stir as local politicians struggle to balance their books.

“It is critical that our municipal governments stop raising taxes, stop adding red tape that inhibits job creation, and focus with Alberta’s government on the overriding goal of economic growth, of job creation, of diversification, and of competitiveness,” Mr. Kenney said.

Lisa Young, a political scientist at the University of Calgary, said Mr. Kenney’s characterization of Ms. Allard as Alberta’s Margaret Thatcher foreshadows further conflict with municipalities.

Story continues below advertisement

“It doesn’t suggest a peaceful fall,” she said. “There’s going to be a lot of saying ‘no’ on this file.”

Mr. Madu, the new Justice Minister, replaces Doug Schweitzer, a high-profile Calgary representative, who was appointed Minister of Jobs, Economy and Innovation. This new ministry replaces Economic Development, Trade and Tourism. Tanya Fir, who held that portfolio, was bumped out of cabinet.

Janet Brown, an independent pollster and political analyst in Calgary, said the Premier is signalling a shift in priorities due to COVID-19 with the move of Mr. Schweitzer to the newly named department.

“This whole idea of jobs, economy and innovation – I think those are the three words that might even end up replacing jobs, economy, pipelines,” she said.

“Jobs, economy, pipelines was the exact right message for the time in 2019 – it won the election,” she said. “But in a COVID world, there’s a different set of priorities.”

Mr. Kenney left three major portfolios that have been affected by the pandemic untouched: Tyler Shandro remains Minister of Health, leading UCP’s fight with physicians over pay and a strategy to reduce waiting lists by increasing the number of private clinics the government covers to perform surgery; Adriana LaGrange continues as Education Minister, overseeing the reopening of primary and secondary schools while trying to cut costs; and Travis Toews is still in charge of the Finance Ministry.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is set to announce $2-billion for provinces and territories to safely reopen schools, as many parents have become increasingly anxious about sending their children back to classrooms this fall.

Mr. Trudeau is expected to make the announcement at a school in north Toronto on Wednesday, federal sources confirmed.

The funding comes in addition to a previously announced $19-billion aid package to provinces, known as the Safe Restart Agreement, to help them deal with the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their economies and health care systems.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Trudeau said in a tweet that he and Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc spoke to the premiers on Tuesday about Canada’s response to COVID-19.

“We also talked about ways we can build on our Safe Restart Agreement to keep you safe as more workplaces reopen and our kids head back to school,” he said.

A senior federal government source said the Prime Minister told the premiers he respects provincial jurisdiction, but his government is willing to provide extra resources to keep children safe. The funding is to be allocated based on each province and territory’s number of students.

One provincial source told The Globe and Mail that provinces welcome the funding but that there is concern it is coming too late for schools to prepare and will lead to delays. The source said the money was only recently discussed, after a dozen first ministers calls took place and the $19-billion Safe Restart Agreement was already announced.

The Globe is not identifying the sources because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.

It is unclear how provinces will use the money and even how quickly it can be put in place. Students in Quebec return to school later this week, and school boards in other parts of the country have been drawing up reopening plans with schools starting in a matter of weeks.

News of Wednesday’s announcement was first reported by the Toronto Star.

Back-to-school plans released by most provincial governments in recent weeks don’t lower class sizes for the youngest learners in the publicly funded systems, which teachers and public-health experts say will make physical distancing virtually impossible.

In Ontario, the government has mandated masks for middle school and high-school students but did not provide funding to lower class sizes in elementary grades, which can have classes of more than 30 students.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford and his Education Minister, Stephen Lecce, have faced criticism from school boards, educators and parents in recent weeks for their back-to-school plan. The government, critics say, has not provided enough funding to lower class sizes or provide sufficient health and safety measures. Some boards have been told to redo their plans weeks after getting the green light from the Ministry of Education.

In a letter to Mr. Lecce late last week, Andréa Grebenc, chair of the Halton District School Board, wrote that trustees are looking for “consistency and clarity of vision so that all resources can be focused on implementing back to school plans.”

Mr. Ford has repeatedly defended his government’s plan as the best in the country.

Ontario NDP Leader Andrea Horwath called the coming announcement “a welcome investment” and urged Mr. Ford’s government to cap class sizes immediately. “We can have #SmallerSaferClasses if we hire more teachers & [education] workers and line up more class spaces now. Continuing to penny-pinch on the backs of kids is not safe,” she said in a tweet Tuesday night.

The Toronto District School Board, Canada’s largest school district, will use a combination of government funding, $29.5-million from its reserves and $2.9-million for elsewhere in its budget to lower class sizes in elementary schools, particularly in those communities hardest hit by COVID-19. The board recently said that kindergarten classes in COVID-19 hotspots would have no more than 15 children and other elementary grades would be at 20 students.

Junior and senior kindergarten classes outside of COVID-19 hot spots could have as many as 26 children in a single space. In those schools, classes between Grades 1 and 3 will be capped at 20, while those between Grades 4 and 8 will have a maximum of 27.

Schools have been shut down across the country since COVID-19 started sweeping across the country in mid-March.

In a court document filed on Tuesday, the Ontario Human Rights Commission accuses the province of incompetence, delay and “even resistance” to its own legally binding commitments, undertaken in 2013, and restated in 2018, to make solitary confinement a measure of last resort for inmates with mental-health disabilities, and maintain a 15-day limit for everyone else.

And federally, the chair of a government panel that Ottawa established to monitor the ending of solitary confinement in federal prisons says the terms of the panel members are ending and they have still not received the information from corrections authorities that would indicate whether the practice is still in widespread use.

The United Nations defines solitary confinement as more than 22 hours a day in a cell without meaningful human contact, and says it must be limited to 15 days. In separate legal challenges, the courts of appeal in British Columbia and Ontario last year found aspects of solitary confinement to be cruel and unusual punishment, prohibited by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Ottawa passed a new law last year in which it promised to scrap the practice, and then dropped its appeal of the constitutional rulings to the Supreme Court.

The new law abolishing the use of solitary established a form of prisoner isolation called structured intervention units. Prisoners are to have at least four hours a day outside their cells, double their previous entitlement, and two hours of “meaningful human interaction.”

Anthony Doob, a University of Toronto criminologist who chairs an eight-person panel created to monitor the new law’s implementation, says Canadians can have no confidence that the Liberal government’s 2019 legislation altered the practices within federal prisons.

“How much confidence do we have that the experience of a prisoner has changed? My answer is none, because we don’t have any information,” he told The Globe and Mail. He accused Public Safety Canada, the ministry led by Bill Blair, and the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) of backtracking and delaying on promises to provide basic data such as the numbers of hours each prisoner in a structured intervention unit spent outside their cell, and whether they had mental-health alerts on their files.

Mary-Liz Power, a spokeswoman for Mr. Blair’s office, said the government is working with the correctional service to address the panel’s concerns, and that it has eliminated segregation. “The new, fundamentally different system focuses on mental-health care, has minimum requirements for time out of cell and meaningful interaction with other people, and is subject to independent external oversight,” she said in an e-mail.

In Ontario, the human-rights commission has filed a motion with the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, an independent adjudicative body, asking it to severely restrict the use of solitary confinement, and ban its use on inmates who have serious mental illness. The commission went to the tribunal for similar reasons in 2017, and the province consented to a similar order the next year.

“These aren’t recommendations or nice ideas,” Insiya Essajee, a lawyer for the commission, said in an interview. “They’re legally binding requirements that came out of a human-rights settlement and Human Rights Tribunal order. If they’re not met, it undermines the human-rights legal system.”

Ontario’s Ministry of the Solicitor-General, which oversees corrections facilities, denies it has failed to respect legally binding orders on solitary confinement. For instance, it has met deadlines for the 31 actions required of it, including revising its policies on the use of segregation and enhancing the mental-health screening of inmates, ministry spokeswoman Kristy Denette said. She cited a report this spring by an independent reviewer, retired judge David Cole, as evidence of commitments kept.

The human-rights commission cites the same report as proof the province has not kept its commitments to end solitary. The report says the most recent data, from July, 2018, until June, 2019, show that 12,059 people were placed in segregation, and that 5,558 of them had mental-health alerts on their files.

In 2013, the Ontario government reached a wide-ranging human-rights settlement with Christina Jahn, a woman with mental-health disabilities and addictions who was held in solitary for more than 200 days. The settlement included a provision that no one with mental illness would be placed in solitary, except as a last resort.

Since then, court rulings and government data have documented that thousands of people, including large numbers with mental-health disabilities, have been placed in solitary, the commission says in a court document. For instance, an Ontario judge ruled this spring in favour of a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of 11,000 prisoners held in solitary long after the 2013 settlement was achieved. In a 2019 ruling, an Ontario judge threw out a charge of first-degree murder after the accused man, Adam Capay, was held 1,647 days in solitary.

Yusuf Faqiri’s 30-year-old brother Soleiman had schizophrenia, and was placed in solitary confinement at Central East Correctional Centre in Lindsay, Ont., before he died on Dec. 15, 2016. A coroner found he had extensive injuries from a prolonged confrontation with correctional officers. Mr. Faqiri said in an interview on Monday that he saw his brother on a video link in a court hearing three days before his death. “I’ve never seen him that sick before. This was torture. My brother slowly deteriorated away.”

JESSE WINTER/Reuters

For the third consecutive month, almost as many people have died across British Columbia from overdosing on an illicit drug as all those who have died in B.C. during the entire coronavirus pandemic.

At a grim news conference Tuesday announcing 175 overdose deaths in July, B.C.‘s top health officials agreed that the shame and stigma associated with substance use is pushing many people into the risky act of consuming street drugs alone and it is imperative that the supply of these toxic substances is replaced with safe, regulated alternatives.

Provincial Health Officer Bonnie Henry said her office is working “as fast as we can” with doctors, nurses, pharmacists and the provincial and federal governments on a solution that could quickly put a considerable dent in the average of five deaths a day that B.C. is experiencing in recent months.

She said this group is improving B.C.‘s small “safe supply” program – which started giving users pharmaceutical alternatives to deadly street drugs in March – by expanding the list of medications offered and making these prescriptions much easier to obtain.

The number of people using the program to get hydromorphone, an opioid that can be prescribed as a replacement for heroin or fentanyl, has more than doubled recently. But, Dr. Henry said, it is still too hard for many users to get a doctor to prescribe this novel treatment. She said within a month her office expects a new protocol to be revised so that people can get these prescriptions from nurses at specialized clinics or doctors or pharmacists available through virtual consultations.

“There has been a dramatic shift in how care is provided in communities right now because of the pandemic and we need to take advantage of that,” she said.

A reluctance by many physicians and nurse practitioners to prescribe, in part because of liability concerns, means people who could benefit from these regulated medications have no way of accessing them. Two months into the new program, in May, just 450 people were accessing this safe supply.

Still, like in much of drug policy, the change is painfully slow, Dr. Henry said, “no more so than for the families that have lost their loved ones.”

Dr. Henry said the safe supply program is looking to expand from pills of hydromorphone to offer injectable versions of that drug as well as other “opioids that people need.”

Guy Felicella, a peer clinical adviser at the BC Centre on Substance Use, said at Tuesday’s news conference that the safe supply program needs to offer pharmaceutical heroin and, possibly, fentanyl.

“Every hour of every day, our failed policies are forcing people to play Russian Roulette, only the odds are decreasing in their favour,” he said.

So far, 203 people have died from COVID-19 in B.C. and, Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe told reporters, the rate of five fatal overdoses a day makes illicit drugs the biggest killers in the province next to other illnesses. Nearly 6,000 people have died since 2016, the year B.C. declared a public-health emergency because of overdose deaths, she said.

“The number of people dying in B.C. due to an unsafe drug supply continues to surpass deaths due to homicides, motor vehicle accidents, suicides and COVID-19 combined, and continues to take a tragic toll on people from all walks of life and all communities in the province,” Ms. Lapointe said.

Ms. Lapointe said the illicit drug chain has been disrupted by the border closures and tumult in international trade brought on by the pandemic, which has led to drug dealers selling substances adulterated with “extreme concentrations” of illicit fentanyl.

In a statement provided by the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions and attributed to department minister Judy Darcy, Ms. Darcy heralded the safe supply program and said her government has doubled the number of youth treatment beds and invested $10.5-million into the number of overdose prevention sites.

Mr. Felicella said he is dismayed at the way the public and the politicians have responded to B.C.‘s twin public-health emergencies.

The Quebec government says it will not adopt Ottawa’s COVID-19 tracking app for now, arguing the pandemic is currently under control in the province.

Éric Caire, Quebec’s minister for digital transformation, announced Tuesday that the government has decided not to move forward with a contact tracing application for the moment, but the province is open to using one in future.

“The aim is to be able to deploy an app immediately if things evolve in a negative way, if a second wave that we’re worried about materializes,” Mr. Caire said at a press conference in Montreal.

Quebec Health Minister rejects criticism of province’s back-to-school strategy

Quebec reported 62 new cases of the coronavirus on Tuesday, with two new deaths.

The federal government launched its smartphone app, called COVID Alert, in late July. Its use is voluntary, and it is designed to warn users if they’ve been near someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, by allowing people to notify the app about a positive test result. It is currently only operational in Ontario, but the plan is to expand it to other provinces.

Thierry Bélair, director of communications for Health Minister Patty Hajdu, said the app has been downloaded by more than two million people. “This app does not track the location of users and does not collect any personally identifiable information. It’s also an additional tool we can use as we prepare for a possible increase in cases this fall. So why not make it available now in Quebec?” he said in a statement.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he plans to speak with Premier François Legault, his Quebec counterpart whom he considers a friend, over dinner in the coming weeks to understand the “method behind the madness” in not supporting the app.

“I encourage everyone to download it and I think it’s a good tool, "" Mr. Ford said at Queen’s Park.

“I always have to be concerned as we open up travel around the country and people are coming in from Quebec and vice versa … . Just do it, it protects everyone and helps everyone out,” he said. “I don’t think it’s a big deal.”

Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan say they support the app and are waiting on further details about its use from the federal government.

Other provinces say they are watching Ontario to see what happens.

A spokeswoman for Nova Scotia said it is monitoring the implementation closely. “The results of that will inform whether Nova Scotia adopts the app,” said Marla MacInnis, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Wellness.

Brant Batters, a spokesman for the Manitoba government, said the province “continues to explore the implications of using the app, taking into account potential public health benefits and security and privacy issues.”

Both Canada’s and Ontario’s privacy commissioners have completed reviews of the app and said they were satisfied with its privacy protections, with both supporting it. However, they added that because of uncertainty over the effectiveness of the app, its use should be closely monitored and the app decommissioned if it does not achieve its intended purpose.

Mr. Legault told reporters Tuesday that, well founded or not, many Quebeckers are concerned about their privacy while using the app. He said all three opposition parties oppose it and a legislative committee studying it raised several issues, even though a public consultation in Quebec found a majority of residents believed it would be useful. Mr. Legault also said he would prefer it if the company that developed the app was from Quebec.

Number of the day

14 per cent

Some Canadians are worried about getting inoculated against COVID-19, a Statistics Canada survey suggests.

More than 76 per cent of respondents indicated they would likely get inoculated if and when a vaccine is ready. Yet 14 per cent said they were somewhat or very unlikely to do so. Nine per cent remained unsure.

Those who indicated they were unlikely to get a vaccine were asked to identify the reasons for their reluctance. More than half cited a lack of confidence in its safety while a similar number said they were worried about potential risks and side effects.

During a news conference Tuesday, Dr. Theresa Tam warned against the spread of online untruths about vaccines. Many experts and political leaders have touted the successful development and widespread rollout of a vaccine as essential for an eventual return to normalcy, including the full reopening of economies and ending physical distancing.

Coronavirus in Canada

In Ottawa, the government is committing $82.5-million for mental health support for Indigenous communities during the pandemic.

Some mental health services have moved online, posing a challenge for remote communities with limited internet access.

The government said the new funds are a response to community activism, will support increased access to services and help Indigenous partners in developing new ways to address substance use.

Coronavirus and business

Bank of Montreal posted a better-than-expected third-quarter profit of $1.23-billion, even as the bank set aside more than $1-billion to cover potential loan losses.

The bank reported $1.05-billion in credit loss provisions, the second straight quarterly increase in funds set aside to cover loans that may go bad.

BMO added $446-million in provisions for loans that are already impaired, and $608-million for loan that are still being paid back but could become delinquent in future, based on economic models.

The bank is still allowing loan deferrals for clients in Canada the U.S., mostly of which are set to expire in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ends Oct. 31.

The border closure between Canada and the United States has severely impacted Point Roberts, Wash., which is landlocked from the rest of the country.

The extended coronavirus-induced border closure shut down two border crossings for the town of about 1,300 people, who must commute 40 kilometres through Canada to get to the rest of Washington state.

“We really need that border open to survive,” said Tamra Hansen, who owns the Saltwater Cafe in Point Roberts.

The economy still depends on the flow of people and resources to and from the border, which closed in March and will remain closed through at least Sept. 21, KING-TV reports.

“I rely on approximately 90 per cent of my business from the Canadians, that come from the seasonal people,” Hansen said. “And we make our money in the summer to get through the winter.”

There is no regular ferry or air service to Point Roberts. There have been no confirmed coronavirus cases reported in the town.

In 2019, 1.4 million people crossed the border into Point Roberts. So far this year, there have been just 217,000 visitors.

Gov. Jay Inslee penned a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last Friday addressing these concerns. Inslee cited in his letter the need for a “practical solution to this issue” and emphasized “unique hardships” faced by Point Roberts residents.

It followed a similar letter to the U.S. ambassador to Canada co-written by the state’s senators, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, and two other Washington state congresspeople.

The city was created because of a quirk in the Oregon Treaty of 1846 between the United Kingdom and the United States. The two countries agreed to settle their border dispute by dividing their territories in the Pacific Northwest along the 49th parallel. But that left the small area of Point Roberts on the southern tip of the Tsawwassen peninsula in American control.

Darryl Marquette, an employee at TSB Shipping in Point Roberts, says the shipping company has had boxes meant for Canada backlogged for months because of the border closures.

Residents like Brian Calder, a longtime resident who worked as a city councillor in Vancouver, have advocated for relief, saying that citizens of Point Roberts should be given an exemption to cross the border.

“Businesses here are down 80 per cent – down 80 per cent!” said Calder. “They can’t survive through this winter. Like, it’s not possible. I’m really pessimistic about the recovery here.”

Canada recently ironed out a plan to allow those in Alaska to cross the border at five specific ports using car placards to identify themselves.

Hansen worries, though, that the efforts of its citizens and lawmakers will be futile.

“All the other restaurants have closed down, the golf course is closed,” Hansen said. “Quite honestly, I probably should have just closed.”

The number of coronavirus infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some – especially older adults and people with existing health problems – it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.

KEVIN LAMARQUE/Reuters

Casting aside his own advice to American diplomats and bulldozing a long tradition of secretary of state nonpartisanship, Mike Pompeo plunged into the heart of the 2020 presidential race Tuesday with a speech supporting Donald Trump’s re-election.

The address was roundly condemned by Democrats and others as an inappropriate breach of decades of diplomatic precedent and a possible violation of federal law prohibiting executive branch employees from overt political activism while on duty. Indeed, Pompeo himself had reminded State Department staffers of those restrictions only last month. Yet he went ahead with the speech, which was recorded in Jerusalem during an official visit to the Middle East, over strident objections, complaints of hypocrisy and the threat of a congressional investigation.

Although the State Department maintained Pompeo was speaking in his personal capacity without any U.S. government support or staffing – therefore, legally – the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee identified him a “secretary of state” in previews of his convention remarks.

But while the venue and audience were extraordinary and perhaps problematic, the content of Pompeo’s roughly four-minute speech would not have been out of place in any number of his previous public appearances either at home or abroad.

Pompeo delivered standard recitations of GOP claims about the successes of Trump’s “America First” foreign policy against Russia, China and Iran. He said they made his family – wife Susan and son Nick – and all Americans safer. He spoke of the defeat of the Islamic State’s physical caliphate, Trump’s pro-Israel agenda and the president’s determined vigilance to guard against the “predatory aggression” of the Chinese Communist Party.

It was material Pompeo has repeated countless times before audiences foreign and domestic at think-tank events, media interviews and press conferences that have seldom been met with raised eyebrows. In fact, Pompeo’s convention speech was relatively mild in comparison with previous comments he has made taking Democrats to task for failed policies.

In an apparent nod to concerns about the appearance, which congressional Democrats allege is in violation of the Hatch Act prohibiting executive branch employees from partisan activity, Pompeo did not attack Trump’s opponent, former Vice-President Joe Biden, by name or even mention the Democratic party. He limited his remarks to a defence of Trump and the policies of the administration – something all secretaries of state do, albeit not at their party conventions.

Widely considered to be interested in seeking the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, Pompeo did not expressly urge voters to cast their ballots for Trump. Instead he limited his exhortation to the observation that “the way each of us can best ensure our freedoms is by electing leaders who don’t just talk, but deliver.”

“Hi. I’m Mike Pompeo,” he began in the pretaped speech that was recorded in Israel Monday near twilight on the roof of the King David Hotel. “I’m speaking to you from beautiful Jerusalem, looking out over the Old City.”

“I have a big job as Susan’s husband and Nick’s Dad,” he said, pausing for effect and knowing full well his audience was aware of the controversy. “They are more safe, and their freedoms more secure, because President Trump has put his America First vision into action. It may not have made him popular in every foreign capital, but it has worked.”

Story continues below advertisement

Even before the speech aired, a senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee announced he had opened an investigation into whether Pompeo is violating the Hatch Act and demanded that the State Department produce its legal justification for the speech. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, who chairs the committee’s panel on government oversight, called Pompeo’s actions “unacceptable.”

After his brief introduction, Pompeo then launched into a brief synopsis of Trump foreign policy highlights, which for Republicans have been all successes and no failures.

Because of Trump, he said, NATO is stronger, Ukraine has been provided with lethal defensive weapons and the U.S. has withdrawn from an arms control treaty to deter Russian aggression with new missiles. He did not mention that Trump’s strong-arm tactics with NATO allies have left many of them resentful and concerned about America’s commitment to their defence; that Trump was impeached for trying to withhold vital military aid to Ukraine in return for political dirt on Biden; or that many national security experts fear the president has set the stage for a new arms race with Russia.

Trump is counting on the support of conservative American Jews and the evangelical Christian community in November, and the choice of Jerusalem – along with the backdrop of the religiously significant Old City – for Pompeo’s speech was clearly aimed at them. As if they needed reminding, Pompeo pointed out that Trump had recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the U.S. embassy there from Tel Aviv, something long desired by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

“The president moved the U.S. Embassy to this very city of God, Jerusalem, the rightful capital of the Jewish homeland,” Pompeo said. “And the President brokered an historic peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, that our grandchildren will read about in their history books.”

Pompeo spoke of pushing back against China on trade and intellectual property theft and of calling out the Chinese for “covering up” the outbreak of the coronavirus that has gripped the world. He did not mention Trump’s initial personal affinity for Chinese leader Xi Jinping, which was ruptured earlier this year by the virus pandemic amid widespread criticism of the president’s handling of the crisis.

On North Korea, Pompeo said Trump had “lowered the temperature and, against all odds, got North Korean leadership to the table.” Left unsaid was the fact that Trump was partly to blame for raising the temperature with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the first place by threatening the country with “fire and fury.” Nevertheless, Pompeo noted that since the first of Trump’s three meetings with Kim, North Korea has not conducted any new nuclear or long-range missile tests.

On Iran, Pompeo talked about Trump’s withdrawal from the “disastrous” 2015 nuclear deal, which has nonetheless left the U.S. isolated at the United Nations with even its strongest allies opposed. He spoke of the defeat of the Islamic State without mentioning that Trump had unexpectedly ordered the withdrawal of American forces from Syria that could jeopardize the victory.

Saudi Arabia has detained another relative of a former senior intelligence official living in exile who recently filed a lawsuit in a U.S. court alleging the kingdom’s crown prince had tried to have him killed, his family said on Wednesday.

Saudi authorities had already detained Saad AlAljabri ’s two adult children and brother in March to try to force his return to the kingdom from exile in Canada, the family and sources with knowledge of the situation had told Reuters earlier this year.

Aljabri was an aide to Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who was ousted and replaced as heir to the throne by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS) in a 2017 palace coup. The sources had said that Aljabri has access to sensitive information that MbS fears could be compromising.

Aljabri’s family said in a statement tweeted by his son Khalid that Aljabri’s son-in-law, Salem Almuzaini, was summoned on Monday to a Saudi state security offices where he was arrested.

“His arrest and disappearance are the latest acts of reprisal and intimidation by Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince ... against Dr. Aljabri for his filing of a Torture Victim Prevention Act claim in U.S. federal court,” the statement said.

The Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Almuzaini’s arrest.

Aljabri, who has lived in Canada since late 2017, earlier this month alleged in a lawsuit filed in U.S. federal court in the District of Columbia that Crown Prince Mohammmed sent a team to kill him in 2018 but that the effort was foiled by Canadian authorities.

The alleged incident took place less than two weeks after Saudi agents murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate, sparking a global furore. MbS has denied ordering Khashoggi’s killing but said he ultimately bore “full responsibility” as the kingdom’s de facto leader.

Riyadh has not publicly commented on Aljabri’s lawsuit.

The family statement said Almuzaini had in 2017 been renditioned by Saudi authorities from Dubai emirate in the United Arab Emirates, but was released in January 2018 after reaching a “settlement” and placed under a travel ban.

Story continues below advertisement

Since then, the statement said, he had been “used by Saudi state security as a means to communicate and exert the Kingdom’s influence on Dr. Aljabri’s family.”

Bin Nayef himself was detained on March 6 along with two other senior royals in what sources have said was the latest in a series of extraordinary measures by MbS to sideline rivals and remove perceived threats to his eventual succession as king.

A source close to bin Nayef said his family had not had any details on his health and detention conditions for several months. The government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on bin Nayef’s status.

Seventeen employees of the world’s largest global climate fund, based in South Korea, have complained of sexism, racism and harassment within the troubled United Nations-led project.

The current and former Green Climate Fund (GCF) workers said they also suffered or witnessed instances of inappropriate relationships and abuse of power in the workplace in the last three years, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday.

In response, the fund’s secretariat said it “strongly refutes claims of systematic staffing problems affecting GCF’s mission to empower developing countries in taking climate action.”

Story continues below advertisement

It said the fund’s Independent Integrity Unit had only substantiated two out of 39 complaints about staff misconduct filed in 2018 and 2019.

“We have zero tolerance for all forms of discrimination and abuse,” Yannick Glemarec, executive director of the GCF, which is headquartered in Songdo, 30 km southwest of the South Korean capital Seoul, said in a statement.

“As the organisation matures, we are continually strengthening all our prevention, reporting and investigation mechanisms, and will continue to do so.”

The allegations come as the #MeToo movement – which began with reports of abuse by former movie producer Harvey Weinstein – has inspired millions to share their stories of harassment. Weinstein was convicted of rape and sexual assault this year.

The GCF was created at UN climate change negotiations in 2010 to help developing countries reduce their planet-heating emissions and adapt to climate shifts.

It has a $6.2-billion portfolio of projects in more than 100 developing countries, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, and approved $879-million in new projects this month.

The staff who made the allegations about the GCF said in a letter seen by the Financial Times that they aimed to hold management accountable for “systemic” sexism and racism and behaviour that had “jeopardized” the fund’s mission.

Story continues below advertisement

The fund also has faced criticism after four people who attended a GCF board meeting in Switzerland in March tested positive for the new coronavirus. One, an environmental expert from the Philippines, died this month.

The meeting had been shifted from South Korea to Geneva, which at that time had no reported cases of the virus, in an effort to avoid infections, GCF officials said.

The fund has previously faced discord over its decision making processes and choices of projects to fund, and has seen turnovers in management.

Russia is preparing to approve a second vaccine against COVID-19 in late September or early October, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova said on Wednesday.

Speaking at a televised government meeting, Golikova told President Vladimir Putin that early-stage clinical trials on the vaccine, developed by the Vector virology institute in Siberia, would be completed by the end of September.

“As of today there have been no complications among those vaccinated in the first and second stages of testing,” she said.

Earlier this month Russia became the first country to grant regulatory approval to a COVID-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing.

The approved vaccine, called “Sputnik V” in homage to the world’s first satellite launched by the Soviet Union, has been hailed as safe and effective by Russian authorities. But Western experts have been sceptical about Russia’s approval of “Sputnik V”, warning against its use until all internationally approved testing and regulatory steps have been taken.

RDIF, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, said on Wednesday the final phase of clinical trials on “Sputnik V” were beginning.

It said 40,000 people would take part in the final trials and that similar trials would also be carried out in five other countries.

Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, said residents of the Russian capital could apply to take part in the trials.

These final trials, carried out on a large number of people, are normally considered essential precursors for a vaccine to receive regulatory approval.

Some 172 countries are engaging with the COVAX facility designed to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, the World Health Organization said on Monday, but more funding is needed and countries need now to make binding commitments. Reuters

Rahmat Gul/The Associated Press

Heavy flooding has killed at least 100 people and injured scores of others as heavy seasonal rains drenched northern and eastern Afghanistan, officials said Wednesday.

Annual heavy rains, compounded by mudslides, often threaten remote areas of Afghanistan, where infrastructure is poor. Summer often brings heavy rainfall in northern and eastern parts of the country, leading to floods that leave hundreds dead every year.

State minister for disaster management Ghulam Bahawudin Jilani said that in northern Parwan province, water inundated the central city of Charikar, where the health ministry said the local hospital was partially destroyed and many of the injured were being transferred to the capital, Kabul.

The provincial spokeswoman, Wahida Shahkar, said the number of casualties may rise as people and rescue teams were still working to locate people buried under destroyed houses. The head of the provincial hospital, Abdul Qasim Sangin, said several children were among the dead and some of the injured are in critical condition.

On a highway just east of Kabul, at least eight people, including two children, drowned and 14 others were injured when the flood waters swept the cars they were in away, according to spokesman Ahmad Tameem Azimi.

A violent flash flood killed more than 70 people and destroyed hundreds of homes just north of Afghanistan's capital on Wednesday, officials said. Reuters

Shahkar said the flooding started in the central part of the province overnight, following heavy rains and destroying many homes. She called on the government to deliver aid and provide immediate support for workers digging through mud to reach those who were trapped.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in a statement ordered aid be delivered to Parwan and other provinces while expressing his condolences to the victims’ families.

Azimi, spokesman of the Disaster Management Ministry, said flooding blocked highways to eastern and northern provinces. “Along with rescuing people we are working to open the highways back to traffic,” he said.

More than 2,000 houses were destroyed in Parwan and over 1,000 people were displaced, Azimi said. Ground and air support sent to help those trapped by the flooding had reached the provinces. The ministry warned residents of possible flooding in the region with a social media alert late Tuesday, he added.

The flooding waters and rushing mud in the mountainous Parwan province carried thousands of large rocks that caused major injuries and destroyed entire homes, burying people under the rubble. Several excavators had reached the area and were digging for those stuck beneath the rubble.

“Nobody could run,” said Shah Arian, 22 one of the victims. He said it all started around midnight, when people were asleep.

“Fifteen people from our two neighbourhoods died,” he said, appealing for government help. “Everything I had is under the mud.”

Azimi, the spokesman, said hundred of acres of agricultural land have been destroyed, with the heavy rain wiping out all the corps in eastern Nuristan province. Houses and roads were destroyed in northern Kapisa, Panjshir and eastern Paktia provinces, Azimi said.

In eastern Maidan Wardak province two people died and five were injured when flooding destroyed several houses, he added.

The office of the Nangarhar governor said in a statement that two members of a family died and four others were injured Wednesday morning when the wall of their house collapsed in flooding.

Melania Trump went there.

While others at the Republican National Convention spoke about the coronavirus largely as a challenge successfully conquered, the first lady on Tuesday night used her address from the Rose Garden to acknowledge the pain of lives lost and families upended by the pandemic.

“I want you to know you’re not alone,” she said to the tens of thousands of families that have been affected. More than 177,000 Americans have been killed by COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.

She promised help fighting the “invisible enemy” was on its way from a determined U.S. President Donald Trump.

“My husband’s administration will not stop fighting until there is an effective treatment or vaccine available to everyone,” she said, speaking to an audience that included the president, the vice-president and his wife, and her parents.

“Donald will not rest until he has done all he can to take care of everyone impacted by this terrible pandemic,” she added in remarks that were softer in tone than many who spoke before her.

Reflecting on protests over racial injustice in the United States, first lady Melania Trump in her address at the RNC on Tuesday called on Americans to ""take a moment, pause, and look at things from all perspectives."" Reuters

President Trump sought to play down the virus at the beginning of the outbreak, and his handling of the pandemic has been widely criticized by doctors and other medical professionals. While Trump regularly refers to COVID-19 as the “China virus,” Mrs. Trump did not.

Mrs. Trump spoke before an audience of several dozen people whose seats were set about 2 feet apart from one another, not the recommended 6 feet apart. Few wore face masks.

She used the night’s keynote speech to advocate for four more years as president for her husband, give a nod to ongoing racial unrest across the country and talk about her own goals for a second term. Although she said she didn’t want to attack anyone, saying “that kind of talk only serves to divide the country further,” she joined speakers before her in criticizing the news media.

“No matter the amount of negative or false media headlines or attacks from the other side, Donald has not and will not lose focus on you,” she said.

“The future of our country has always been very important to him and it is something that I have always admired,” said the first lady, who met Trump in New York City in 1998, two years after arriving in the U.S. from her native Slovenia, a former communist country in eastern Europe.

“He doesn’t just speak words. He demands action and he gets results,” she said.

Amid ongoing civil unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, after the police shooting of a Black man, Mrs. Trump urged Americans to stop the violence. She recalled her visit in 2018 to the West African nation of Ghana, where she learned about the slave trade.

“It is a harsh reality that we are not proud of parts of our history,” she said. “We must remember that today we are all one community. Our diverse and storied history is what makes our country strong, and yet we still have so much to learn from one another.”

“I also ask people to stop the violence and looting being done in the name of justice and never make assumptions based on the colour of a person’s skin,” she added. She did not mention the Wisconsin shooting.

Mrs. Trump said she would build on her Be Best youth initiative, if her husband is reelected, and would work with states to pass legislation. She said she’ll continue her work on foster care and tribal nations, as well as preserving the White House.

“I’m here because we need my husband to be president and commander in chief for four more years,” she said before referring to his propensity for sharing his feelings — good and bad — on Twitter.

“Total honesty is what we as citizens deserve from our president,” his wife said. “Whether you like it or not, you always know what he’s thinking. And that is because he is an authentic person.”

Just like Trump has upended norms of the presidency, Melania Trump has altered what it means to be a modern first lady, from continuing to live in New York City in the administration’s opening months to forcing the ouster of a deputy national security adviser. Not since Nancy Reagan has any first lady asserted herself so publicly in West Wing personnel matters.

Like the president, her tenure can also be defined by its ups and downs.

The first lady arranged a splashy launch for “Be Best,” her signature initiative for children, but was put on the defensive for including anti-cyberbullying when the president regularly uses Twitter to attack anyone he feels has betrayed him.

She rushed to the southern border to visit migrant children after the administration started separating families at the border with Mexico, a rare instance where she publicly opposed the president’s policy.

But en route, the former fashion model donned a green hooded jacket with “I Really Don’t Care, Do U?” scrawled on the back. She didn’t wear it around the children, but the baffling wardrobe choice quickly overshadowed the goodwill border visit.

Her announcements this year of two costly though privately funded White House improvement projects — construction of a tennis pavilion and a Rose Garden renovation — opened her to charges of tone-deafness and a flurry of social media commentary likening her to France’s Marie Antoinette. She tweeted that the naysayers should “contribute something good & productive in their own communities” instead of criticizing her.

She has not responded publicly to claims by porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal that they’d had affairs with Trump, to the Russia investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller or to Trump’s impeachment by the Democratic-controlled House for pushing Ukraine to investigate his political opponents. Trump denies the extramarital relationships and was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate.

Mrs. Trump said months ago that she’s ready for another four years.

The first lady spoke Tuesday from the recently renovated Rose Garden, despite questions about the propriety of using the White House for an overtly political purpose. The coronavirus forced her to scrap many of her 2020 plans, including headlining her first Trump fundraisers."

Geoffrey Fieger, who was hired by Timesha Beauchamp’s family, said she remains in critical condition at Sinai-Grace Hospital in Detroit, where she is on a respirator and her heart is beating on its own.

“The doctors are unable to give a prognosis right now, and have indicated that it’s touch and go,” Fieger said during an online news conference.

Fieger said the family of the Southfield woman, who was born with cerebral palsy and has always needed constant medical care, are shaken by the blunder that led to her being incorrectly declared dead.

He read a statement from Timesha’s mother, Erica Lattimore, who said that, “On behalf of the family we are devastated by what has happened. We would like people to continue to pray for Timesha and keep her family in their prayers.”

Fieger said he’s just begun investigating at the family’s request what he called the “negligence” that led to Timesha being declared dead Sunday morning at the family’s suburban Detroit home, only to be discovered to be alive after she arrived at the James H. Cole funeral home in Detroit.

He said he believes that after she was declared dead, police put Timesha in a body bag at her family’s home and she was inside it, breathing, for about 2 1/2 hours before she arrived at the funeral home. Fieger said she was found to be alive as she was about to be embalmed.

“She was alive. Her eyes were open and she was breathing. My recollection is that the embalmer was actually there and was the person who opened the body bag,” he said.

Timesha receives three breathing treatments every day that are needed due to her medical condition, Fieger said. On Sunday, the family called 911 about 7:30 a.m. after her mother and brother became concerned after her first breathing treatment and noticed she was in distress. He said Timesha had apparently suffered a seizure.

“It was at that time that the family noticed that her lips were pale, and that she had some secretions around her mouth and that she was having difficulty breathing. And the family called Steven, Timesha’s brother, in and then they called 911,” Fieger said.

He said police arrived within about 15 minutes and four paramedics also arrived at the family home. Fieger said the medical responders were told of Timesha’s medical history, the medications she receives and about her daily breathing treatments.

Fieger said following live saving efforts, what happened next remains “very, very murky” to the family and himself but Timesha was declared to be dead, when she actually needed urgent medicare care.

“She needed medical treatment and needed transportation to a hospital, but got transportation to a funeral home,” he said.

Fieger said she was declared dead even though her godmother, who he said is a registered nurse, told the paramedics she had seen Timesha breathing and she felt that she had a pulse. He said the paramedics dismissed the godmother’s concerns, telling her drugs they had given Timesha were causing those movements.

“The godmother felt that she saw chest movements and felt that she had a pulse. She told the paramedics and the paramedics told her that the movements were involuntary and were the result of the medication. And they went, according to the family, a total of three times to Timesha’s room to look at her,” he said.

After she was declared dead, he said an officer with Southfield police gave the family his card, wrote on the back of it the medical examiner’s number and told the family to provide that number to the funeral home when funeral home staff came to pick up Timesha. The funeral home was called at 9 a.m. and she was picked up about 11:25 a.m., he said, only to be discovered alive about 20 minutes later at the funeral home.

The city of Southfield said it’s conducting an internal investigation but insisted that the fire and police departments followed procedures.

The Southfield fire department has acknowledged it was involved in Sunday’s events, and said Monday in a statement that the situation began when a medical crew was summoned to a home on a report that a 20-year-old woman was unresponsive.

Paramedics tried to revive her for 30 minutes and consulted an emergency room doctor, the department said. The doctor “pronounced the patient deceased based upon medical information provided” from the scene, it said in Monday’s statement.

The department said it then informed the Oakland County medical examiner’s office of the death and the on-duty forensic pathologist “released the body” to the family.

Battalion Chief Chris Smith said Wednesday that the fire department’s chief would have an updated statement, but he was uncertain when that would be released."

Gunman Brenton Tarrant, a 29-year-old Australian, is scheduled to be sentenced this week after pleading guilty to 51 murders, 40 attempted murders and one charge of committing a terrorist act during the 2019 shooting rampage in the city of Christchurch which he livestreamed on Facebook.

A murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison. The judge can impose a life term without parole, a sentence that has never been used in New Zealand.

Dozens of survivors and families of victims have addressed the court this week and many have urged the judge to sentence Tarrant to the most severe sentence.

Diriye, a refugee from Somalia who moved to New Zealand 25 years ago, told the court his son had been robbed of a future.

“He used to engage and play with the police; at home he would run around the house pretending to be a cop and wear police uniform. We thought one day he might become a police officer,” he said in his statement.

While most of Tarrant’s victims were at Al Noor mosque, including Mucaad Ibrahim, he killed seven people at the Linwood mosque, before being detained en route to a third.

Ahad Nabi, who lost his 71-year-old father in the attack, stared at Tarrant before delivering a passionate statement, demanding that Tarrant should “never walk free” for his cowardly actions on March 15, 2019.

“You are weak, a sheep with a wolf’s jacket on for only 10 minutes of your whole life,” said Nabi, referring to the shooting rampage.

“There’s nothing heroic about shooting people from behind and people not having a chance of defending themselves.”

Sara Qasem, daughter of victim Abdelfattah Qasem, said she would miss smelling her father’s garden sauce cooking and wanted to hear his stories about the “olive trees in Palestine”.

“You made a choice here – a conscious, stupid, irresponsible, cold-blooded, selfish, disgusting, heinous, evil choice,” Qasem said, looking at Tarrant, seated and surrounded by guards.

Prosecutors have told the court that Tarrant wanted to instill fear in those he described as invaders and that he carefully planned the attacks to cause maximum carnage.

Republicans pressed their case on Tuesday for U.S. President Donald Trump’s re-election over Democrat Joe Biden, arguing as their convention opened for a second day that Mr. Trump’s leadership was vital to the country’s economic and political future.

First lady Melania Trump and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will highlight the program in speeches that have drawn complaints from Democrats for using the White House and a diplomatic trip for partisan purposes.

Hours before Republicans reconvened, the President issued a pardon to a convicted Nevada bank robber, Jon Ponder, who has become an advocate for other inmates and will speak to the convention on Tuesday.

“Jon’s life is a beautiful testament to the power of redemption,” Mr. Trump said in a video.

Also speaking will be Richard Beasley, the FBI agent, now retired, who arrested Mr. Ponder in 2004. They are among an array of Americans to testify that Mr. Trump’s policies have helped them.

“I strongly support President Trump’s re-election. When he sees something isn’t right, he’s fearless in fixing it. He listens to working people,” Maine lobsterman Jason Joyce was expected to say, according to advance excerpts.

Other Americans speaking in defence of Mr. Trump’s policies on Tuesday had been expected to include Mary Ann Mendoza, whose police officer son died in a head-on collision with a drunk driver who was in the country illegally. CNN said she was pulled from the program after retweeting an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. She later apologized.

On Monday, the opening day, Republicans painted a dire portrait of a future United States under Mr. Biden’s leadership, with Trump campaign adviser Kimberly Guilfoyle asserting that Democrats want to “destroy this country.”

The tone drew complaints from Democrats who said Mr. Trump was to blame for mismanaging the coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 177,000 Americans – more than any other country in the world – and thrown millions out of work.

“Last night was grim and spiteful and fear-inducing,” Michigan Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer told reporters in a call.

Adding to the dark picture, parts of Kenosha, Wis., were smoldering after another night of unrest sparked by the shooting of a Black man by police. The man, who remains in intensive care, was shot in the back.

BIDEN LEADS IN POLLS

With 70 days remaining until the Nov. 3 election, Mr. Biden, 77, who served as vice-president under Barack Obama, leads Mr. Trump, 74, in opinion polls. Democrats nominated Mr. Biden to challenge Mr. Trump at their party’s convention last week.

Melania Trump’s planned speech in the White House Rose Garden and the speech by Mr. Pompeo, from a diplomatic trip to Israel, have been criticized by Democrats.

They questioned the propriety of using the presidential residence for political purposes and of Mr. Pompeo making a political speech while on a government trip. Mr. Trump himself will deliver a speech from the White House lawn on Thursday.

Mr. Pompeo planned to speak from Jerusalem even though he warned diplomats in July that presidential appointees should not take part in partisan activity, in a cable sent to all U.S. diplomatic and consular posts abroad.

Mr. Biden’s deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said Mr. Pompeo’s decision to give a political speech during an overseas mission is a “blatant use of office for overtly political purposes” that undermines the critical work being done by the State Department.

Story continues below advertisement

The Democrat who chairs a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee, Joaquin Castro, announced on Tuesday an investigation into whether Mr. Pompeo’s appearance broke federal law and regulations.

The Trump campaign has shrugged off complaints about the use of federal properties as a partisan stage, and said it would ensure all staff and participants were in compliance with the 1939 Hatch Act restricting federal employees from engaging in certain political activities.

The president and vice-president are excluded under the law, although there could be implications for staff depending on their level of involvement.

A total of 17 million people watched the Republican convention’s first night on Monday, according to Nielsen, fewer than the 19.7 million TV viewers who watched the first night of the Democratic National Convention last week.

Also scheduled to speak on Tuesday were Mr. Trump’s son Eric and daughter Tiffany as well as Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds and U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.

What they got

This 2,438 sq. ft. unit on the 38th floor in the Shaw Tower is actually two strata units that were combined. It has panoramic views of English Bay, Coal Harbour and Northshore mountains. The two-bedroom, three and a half bathroom condominium includes custom millwork, concrete floors, automated blinds, lighting and audio, two balconies and three-car private garage. The building allows pets and rentals.

The action

The sellers purchased the home in 2014 for $3.2-million and had tried to sell it with another realtor in 2018 with an asking price of $6.98-million, says listing agent Ian Watt. The sellers recently put it back on the market, deciding they want to live in a bigger home. Mr. Watt showed it to four parties and the buyers did their due diligence, waited a month, and presented a cash offer, which, he says, was smart. “It’s hard to say no when they send you an offer with a deposit ready to go within the hour. They were very organized.”

It is one of two sales downtown in that price range in the last 30 days, says Mr. Watt. The sale completes Sept. 21.

The agent’s take

The units in the building sell for around $2,000 a square foot, says Mr. Watt. “It’s a commercial grade building with two commercial tenants, including [billionaire] Jim Pattison. Everything is built to last. If someone like Bill Gates called me and said, ’I’d like to look at units in Vancouver,’ it would qualify. It’s that calibre of building.”

Just east of Trinity-Bellwoods Park, this two-storey house has a unique, one-bedroom layout that likely contributed to its inability to find a buyer when on the market last year. New agents were brought in last fall. Hoping to raise its profile with target buyers, Irene Kaushansky and Philip Brown suggested minor repairs, staging and a price change, which enticed upwards of 200 people to visit, but resulted in no acceptable offers.

“The whole house was 760 square feet and it had no basement and no parking, so we knew it was going to be a limited buyer pool,” Ms. Kaushansky said.

“We were targeting people moving out of lofts or condos, and downsizers.”

The house was taken off the market for the holidays, rented out on Airbnb, and was relisted again this spring.

“The market picked up early, so we put it on and started getting traction,” Ms. Kaushansky said. “Then COVID hit.”

“It was timing no one could have predicted, but after all of that, in the middle of COVID, we got [competing bids].”

The economic uncertainty wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic has turned Toronto’s rental market upside down, industry insiders said.
Power once wielded exclusively by landlords has been passed to their would-be tenants, giving renters the chance to negotiate lower prices – and bigger perks.
“And that’s come to almost a full standstill.”But for those who are looking for units, she said, the benefits are manifold.

Nam was last on the hunt, two years ago.

Back then, it took a personal connection for Mx. Nam to secure a lease, but this time around they and their partner signed one a week after seeing the apartment, which is both bigger and cheaper than their current unit.

“It was very quick,” said Mx. Nam, who uses gender-neutral pronouns. “Quicker than what I experienced a couple years ago when I was looking for a place. I found that not only were the rental prices high, but the turnaround was not that fast.”

The process was so quick this time that landlords have been following up with Mx. Nam and their partner for weeks, calling to see if they’re still interested in seeing soon-to-be-vacant units.

The economic uncertainty wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic has turned Toronto’s rental market upside down, industry insiders said.

Power once wielded exclusively by landlords has been passed to their would-be tenants, giving renters the chance to negotiate lower prices – and bigger perks.

Nam and their partner, for instance, asked that the unit be painted before they moved in. And they were able to choose a place with a hands-on landlord with long-term tenants.

The market has been flooded with rental units previously used as Airbnbs or occupied by people who have since moved in with parents or friends to save money, said Geordie Dent, executive director of the Federation of Metro Tenants’ Associations.

“You’re hearing this kind of [thing] across the board. A lot of people are moving into units that are semi-furnished and looked like they were ready to go as an Airbnb,” Mr. Dent said. “The other area where I think you might see some increasing supplies [is] from student housing.”

According to a report released this month by the online brokerage Zoocasa, the number of condos listed for rent in Toronto spiked 45 per cent in the second quarter of 2020, compared with the same time last year. In the downtown area, it grew a whopping 80 per cent.

The average condo rental price across the city dropped by 6 per cent over the previous year, the report said, as the number of condos leased declined by 25 per cent in the same period.

Sara Rowshanbin, a broker who represents buyers, sellers, landlords and tenants, said her business has seen a dramatic shift during the pandemic, with fewer people looking to rent.

“When I usually have tenant clients this time of the year, it’s almost exclusively students or new immigrants looking to secure housing before the school year starts,” she said. “And that’s come to almost a full standstill.”

But for those who are looking for units, she said, the benefits are manifold.

“In the downtown core, which is where most of my tenants would be looking at this time of the year, it’s so, so much easier in terms of finding a better price,” Ms. Rowshanbin said.

She said some have been shocked by the shift.

“We forget in Toronto, the market doesn’t always go up in a balanced situation. It sometimes stays the same, and once in a while it goes down a little,” she said. “The extent that we’ve seen leases go down, in the midst of a pandemic especially, it’s actually a little bit welcome. It’s part of the balance.”

William Blake, a landlord and member of the Ontario Landlords Association, agreed.

“Let’s face it, landlords have been having a very solid, strong market. We’ve had the advantage over the past 10 years especially,” he said. “But tenants now have higher expectations. They can shop around, so landlords have to take that extra step to make their place stand out.”

Mr. Blake said he has been upgrading the appliances in his units and lowering rents, he said – anything to make them “sparkle.”

He said he hopes this serves as a wake-up call to absentee landlords.

“The professional landlords who take being a landlord very, very seriously, like myself, we’re still doing very well. The turbulence is fine,” he said.

“But it’s the amateur landlords who thought, ‘Oh, it’s just an investment. I don’t have to work at all. I just put people in and collect the rent.’ These are the people who are going to be having a hard time during this period.”

City of Vancouver Archives

Harland Bartholomew is a name from Vancouver’s past that has come up a lot lately, and not in a good way.

The American was a civil engineer who became a well-known advocate of city planning before it was even a profession, and he had a role in the design of more than 500 cities – including early Vancouver. Vancouver was made up of three municipalities at the time, including Vancouver, South Vancouver and Point Grey, and commissioners decided they needed a comprehensive plan for Vancouver and the region.

The pioneering city planner, who was well known by that time, was going to bring order to the region. The Bartholomew Plan, as it’s known, was completed in 1928 but was never officially adopted by the Vancouver Town Planning Commission who’d hired the St. Louis-based firm. As a result, some of the ideas were ignored; others were implemented, helping develop the city that stands today.

But it’s that prescribed order that critics of Mr. Bartholomew now cite as doing irreversible damage to a growing city. His zoning recommendations, particularly around single family homes was too rigid, and as a consequence have thwarted the potential for healthy density that would have otherwise occurred over the decades, says Sam Sullivan, Minister of Legislative Assembly for Vancouver-False Creek. Mr. Sullivan also sat on Vancouver city council for 15 years and served as mayor from 2005 to 2008, and he’s long argued for significant density.

Before the Bartholomew Plan came along, he says, Vancouver’s housing system had the ability to respond to market forces. He blames the plan for forcing people into rigid single-family lot areas. Many blame that emphasis on single-family lots as creating exclusionary zoning, a way to segregate by class. Because racial minorities at the time were often low income, it also had the effect of segregating by race. As a result, the Bartholomew Plan has lately become synonymous with class-based discrimination.

“He basically drew lines around where all the borders were, and he said, ‘for the next 100 years it stops here, we aren’t going to have any more moving boundaries.’ So he basically froze the single-family guys right in place and basically it hasn’t moved since 1928,” Mr. Sullivan says.

Mr. Sullivan created a YouTube video for his Kumtuks channel that explains how Mr. Bartholomew introduced top-down thinking in an otherwise British style, organic garden city arranged around a grid pattern for the streetcar system.

“I think Bartholomew has been a disaster. I would have loved it if we had an organic system. He stopped the incremental gradual densification that would have normally happened in an organic city and he froze it in place. And the people who were wealthy loved it, and the people who were not quite wealthy didn’t want their area zoned. Nobody really wants change, but when you do it for 100 years then it gets really dysfunctional. Now you get the prices we have and the sprawl we have. … If Bartholomew hadn’t come around, the downtown would have slowly and surely grown a bit more and it would be encompassing more areas.

“Now you get the high house prices, and it’s completely unresponsive. Our land use cannot respond, whereas normally if you had a $2-million Strathcona house, and that existed without zoning, there would be a fast response. You would suddenly get taller buildings and apartments would pop up all over.”

Nobody would suggest that Mr. Bartholomew was a progressive, championing the rights of minorities. He was a man of his time; massive social change was still to come. There are suggestions of elitist thinking in the 1928 plan, such as when he speaks of people of a “higher class” who will one day move into the False Creek industrial area. But to blame the Bartholomew Plan for Vancouver’s over-emphasis on single-family houses – and wealth disparity in general – isn’t entirely accurate either, say others who’ve studied the plan in detail.

We have to remember, says urban planner and former city councillor Gordon Price, that the plan was never officially adopted. Mr. Price plans to write about the topic on his Vancouver blog, Price Tags.

“If you think Bartholomew was the evil genius behind all of this, you have to assume that his plan was implemented. But no, it wasn’t. That suggests to me that it wasn’t [adopted] because it simply wasn’t necessary to do so. The assumptions behind the plan were already in place.”

Mr. Price, who possesses a leather-bound copy of the plan, says critics are attributing too much power to Mr. Bartholomew. It was the town commissioners who were pushing to protect single-family housing zones and Mr. Bartholomew was responding to their wishes, Mr. Price says. They already had created zoning in the municipality of Point Grey, for example. And according to data in the Bartholomew Plan, there were 23,079 single-family dwellings already built in Vancouver, with an average of 4.5 persons per dwelling, or 72.3 per cent of the population. By contrast, there were 662 apartment buildings that housed 12,764 people, or 8.9 per cent of the population. And according to the 1921 census, 65 per cent of the city was renting – almost all of them in single-family homes (from Jesse Donaldson’s book, Land of Destiny: A History of Vancouver Real Estate).

The real estate industry had been thriving long before his plan, and speculators and investors saw the demand for detached houses among both owners and renters. The wealth divide was already under way.

And Vancouver has a long history of protecting single-family zoning, including Mr. Sullivan’s time on council. During the Depression, many Shaughnessy mansion owners couldn’t pay their mortgages so the homes became rooming houses, and although illegal, the city turned a blind eye for decades. They provided affordable housing, central to downtown.

“When I got on council in the 1990s we were shutting down these Shaughnessy rooming houses,” Mr. Sullivan says. “I was thinking, ‘What are we doing?’ I met someone who said it was a huge war between people who owned and people renting out their places.

Story continues below advertisement

“They were slowly but surely moved out, a determined effort over the years to shut them down. It was terrible when I think about it.”

But in the 1920s, owning a house was a possibility for the average income earner, which drew newcomers to the region. In his plan, Mr. Bartholomew writes: “That the one-family dwelling is the desirable unit for happy living is the general consensus of opinion of all authorities.”

The house was an icon that many working people could afford in those days, Mr. Price says.

“We had land and a transportation system that opened up that land. We were dumping housing into the market. This is the demand-supply argument that rages today.

“He did not create zoning, nor did he bring in anything that would suggest we do anything differently than the people who hired him to do what they wanted.”

Interestingly, Mr. Bartholomew touched on the topic of affordable housing in the Plan. He said “the housing problem, as outlined by some, can only be solved when the city or state is in a position to guarantee to every individual householder a wage sufficient for the payment of a reasonable rent.

Story continues below advertisement

“While town planning can go far to create and maintain desirable housing conditions, it is beyond its scope … to concern itself with the very important economic problem.”

The 310-page plan is available online thanks to architect Bing Thom, who died in 2016. Mr. Thom considered the plan important enough to fund the digitization of it, along with all other Bartholomew reports, says Andy Yan, who worked for many years as a planner for Bing Thom Architects. Mr. Yan says that the regional governments spent the equivalent of $1.1-million in today’s dollars over three years for the plan.

The majority of the plan concerns itself with transit, largely because Mr. Bartholomew believed Metro Vancouver would grow to one million people by 1960.

He was a supporter of walkability and livability (later, he would become more car-centric). The plan says that no resident should have to walk more than a half-mile to a public park, and all schools were to include generous playgrounds. His staff drew elaborate, detailed illustrations of playgrounds. In fact, the section of the plan devoted to zoning doesn’t begin until page 211, and it’s relatively scant. There’s not much on housing, either.

“I think some people are desperately trying to make him a rogue engineer-planner,” says Mr. Yan, director of Simon Fraser University’s City Program. “It’s just really easy to blame somebody, especially when they’ve been dead for 30 years and their work is almost 100 years old.

Mr. Yan also has a leather-bound original edition of the plan, and he believes that Mr. Bartholomew merely reflected the city’s values – including an early obsession with preserving property values. The plan, he says, wasn’t all bad, and we can thank the planner for a few things that came to define Vancouver.

“He’s not a hero, but he’s not necessarily a villain. He leaves a legacy of public schools, parks and the transit system, because he created the bones for that infrastructure. My own public elementary school was one of the schools built according to the Bartholomew Plan.”

Mr. Yan recently unearthed a newspaper article from 1944 that appears to reveal a key motivation that the authorities of the time chose to focus on single-family dwellings more than apartment buildings. Mr. Bartholomew had returned to Vancouver at the time to work on an updated plan, and he gave a talk to the Kitsilano ratepayers about the post-war rebuilding effort. He said that “expansion to outlying districts,” or sprawl, would be halted. They’d build density by rebuilding slum areas in the inner city and rehabilitate “blighted” areas between city and suburbs.

He said that uncontrolled expansion decreased property values. Vancouver, he said, had zoned property for apartment dwellings in excess of its needs, threatening those land values.

“More land has been set aside for these purposes than will be needed for years, and this doesn’t create new values,” he told the audience.

“That tells you something – that it was about speculation,” Mr. Yan says. “There’s this tension between those who want to live here and real estate speculation, and there always has been that tension. The fault is not among the stars, it’s within ourselves.”

The sellers had spent months readying this detached house for sale and they were unwilling to pause their plans because of a pandemic, even if it required more online marketing materials, vetting of qualified buyers and strict showing protocols in late April.

“One thing we started to do with COVID in place was not just posting the prettiest photos online, but also photos of the mechanical systems and the basement, essentially showing all the warts,” agent Irene Kaushansky said. “We were looking to decreased the amount of live traffic.”

The scarcity of other homes for sale nearby likely helped boost the turnout of roughly two dozen visitors.

“We ended up with seven offers, so we were pleased with that because I don’t know in a normal market if we would’ve had more than that,” Ms. Kaushansky said.

The action

In late May and early June, prospective buyers were able to conduct virtual walk-throughs online, or come in-person to check out this vacant, two-bedroom plus den corner suite in a high rise building on St. Clair Avenue near Yonge Street.

“The number of showings was not as plentiful as it might have been in usual times,” agent Elli Davis said, “but the [eventual] buyer was very interested in the building’s location and space.”

“There’s usually a small number [of units] that come up [in this building], but they do sell quickly.”

Story continues below advertisement

What they got

This unit on the building’s southeast corner has French doors opening to the den and a gas fireplace in the living room, as well as a formal dining room and a casual breakfast area in the kitchen.

The unit comes with two bathrooms and laundry facilities, plus a storage locker and parking. Each month, fees of $1,235 pay for water, concierge, and a common gym and recreation room.

The agent’s take

“This one is a good size at 1,526-square-feet, but it was in original condition and requires some updating,” Ms. Davis said.

“It has prime positioning in the city at Yonge and St. Clair; you can walk to the subway.”

Canmore’s tourist numbers were drastically reduced in June as visits to nearby Banff National Park were way down. But online traffic to this semi-detached home was good, with nearly 150 hits. Only a few of those ventured by for an in-person look, but several made formal purchase offers, pushing the sale price $20,200 over asking.

“We weren’t seeing things on the market selling in multiple offers at the time coming out of the pandemic, but this property has a fantastic location very close to the river and town,” said agent Drew Betts.

To showcase views of the nearby Rockies, there are vaulted ceilings, walls of windows and balconies off the second-floor living room and master bedroom.

“It’s an immaculate home in such great shape – lightly used – and it has outdoor space,” Mr. Betts said.

“But the location is the big selling feature, very close to the river and river trails, as well as a short stroll to the main street.”

The backstory

Open this photo in gallery The home is on a lot overlooking Wooden Sticks Golf Course. Mitchell Fain/The Print Market /Mitchell Fain/The Print Market

Gary Roberts was a 27-year-old forward with the Calgary Flames when he became a part-owner of the Wooden Sticks Golf Club in Uxbridge, Ont.

During the next decade or so, Mr. Roberts spent much of his time on the road, playing in the National Hockey League with Calgary, the Carolina Hurricanes and his hometown Toronto Maple Leafs.

Story continues below advertisement

A round of golf at Wooden Sticks was usually on the agenda when Mr. Roberts, who grew up in nearby Whitby, was in town visiting family. He was biding his time until the day he could settle in the area.

“I love the rolling hills of Uxbridge,” Mr. Roberts says.

He and his wife, Michelle Lalonde, were driving in the area one summer afternoon when Mr. Roberts saw a sign advertising a small housing development. It appeared as if the homes would nestle right up to the course.

“We were actually golfing the day he spotted the sign,” Ms. Lalonde says.

The couple visited the site and purchased a lot on a high point of land overlooking a greenspace near the 14th hole.

The couple took their time planning while Mr. Roberts played for the Florida Panthers, then broke ground when he joined the Pittsburgh Penguins. After so much time traveling to arenas all over North America, Mr. Roberts knew that he wanted a year-round retreat with lots of room for big gatherings.

“We looked at it as a place where we could enjoy lots of family time.”

The house today

Their choice of an interior designer was decided after a visit to the home of Mr. Roberts’s Maple Leafs teammate, Tie Domi. Jeffrey Douglas of Douglas Design Studio had garnered awards for his work on Mr. Domi’s Toronto home.

Mr. Douglas designed a home centered around Mr. Roberts’s passion for fitness and the outdoors.

“I used to go to the meetings and just enjoy watching him sketch,” Mr. Roberts says.

Thirteen years ago this month, the house was completed and the couple moved in with their young son.

Their first big event was a weekend of celebrations set around their wedding at a nearby private golf course.

An upstairs guest suite includes a family room, a kitchenette and a private deck for visiting relatives.

The main floor centers on a large kitchen next to a “Muskoka room” that can be opened to the elements by sliding away the screens.

“It just doubles the size of our entertainment area,” Ms. Lalonde says. “It’s all open and connected.”

Open this photo in gallery The kitchen has a 60-inch gas range. Mitchell Fain/The Print Market /Mitchell Fain/The Print Market

“Ms. Lalonde spends lots of time in the kitchen, which has a 60-inch gas range and plenty of space for prep work. All of the sightlines look towards the pool and pool deck, she says, so that she can see the action outside while she’s cooking.

“I’ve got a lot of big appetites here,” she says.

When they first moved in, Mr. Roberts was making the transition to a new career in player development and fitness for junior and professional athletes. He asked Mr. Douglas to include a 1,500-square foot gym on the main floor.

“What I thought when we built was, I would run the high-performance training out of the house,” he says.

The gym includes a Super X vulcanized rubber track, in-floor heating and walls of glass that slide away to open up the space in good weather. Mr. Roberts says his devotion to fitness helped him to stay in the NHL until the age of 43, when he ended his playing days with the Tampa Bay Lightning.

“The wellness part of my home obviously extended my career because of my lifestyle,” he says.

As Mr. Roberts worked to rehabilitate his body after some injuries, he thought he might make another comeback. But he was working out in the home gym when he realized that was not to be.

“One day I said, ‘Honey, I think I’m just going to be the coach from now on.‘”

He began to spend more time building his high-performance training business.

Story continues below advertisement

Steven Stamkos and Connor McDavid are among the many NHL players who have trained with Mr. Roberts. Athletes who play golf, basketball and soccer have also sought his help.

“We’re trying to make better athletes,” he says.

For the first few years, Mr. Roberts helped players develop their strength and fitness at the property on Sugarbush Lane, where he had installed an infinity pool, hot tub, outdoor yoga deck, sand volleyball court and a sports court that became an ice rink in the winter.

“Guys were coming to my house and they didn’t want to leave,” Mr. Roberts says of the days when 20 or so young athletes at a time would hang around to enjoy the amenities. “It was like a resort. Summers were crazy for a few years.”

By that time, the couple had two more little ones, and Ms. Lalonde suggested it was time to move the business out of their home.

“I encouraged him to find another spot to train all his guys.”

Story continues below advertisement

Today the training centre is based in Aurora, Ont., and Mr. Roberts and Ms. Lalonde use the gym mostly for family training. Their two sons are hockey players and their younger daughter is a figure skater. Mr. Roberts’s eldest daughter lives in British Columbia.

Mr. Roberts says he stays motivated by mixing up his routine with swimming, yoga, weight lifting and running.

“I do something for my body one hour a day.”

Open this photo in gallery The home boasts 8,000 square feet of living space. Mitchell Fain/The Print Market /Mitchell Fain/The Print Market

Once a year he brings the clients and staff from the performance centre to spend a day at the house.

“It’s like a play day,” he says, describing one group of guys playing volleyball, another bunch on the basketball court, two or three guys in the infrared sauna and a few in the regular sauna. He sets up ice tubs for recovery and turns the yoga deck into a treatment centre.

At the end of the day, they all enjoy a meal, says Mr. Roberts, who admits to being a tough coach – but one who has learned from his colleagues.

“I would say I’ve softened over the years,” he says. “Initially I was a little abrasive.”

Mr. Roberts says the extended family also spends time at the property and he still invites his former NHL teammates to get together whenever they can.

Mr. Domi, Curtis (Cujo) Joseph, Mats Sundin and Bryan McCabe are a few of the former Leafs he enjoys reminiscing with, and Joe Nieuwendyk has been a friend since the two grew up together in Whitby.

“I still keep in touch with the crew and we all talk about how great we were,” he says with a laugh. “Some of my fondest memories were playing with the Leafs. I don’t think I ever would have felt the same not wearing a Leafs jersey.”

The best feature

Mr. Roberts, who has sometimes taken on coaching duties for kids’ hockey teams in the Uxbridge area, can put his sons and their friends through drills on the 75-foot-by-45-foot ice rink in the backyard.

A love of the game runs through the generations: Mr. Roberts’ dad, brothers and nephews all play as well.

“Gary always says there’s no better feeling than playing hockey outdoors,” Ms. Lalonde says. “Every Christmas there’s a big family hockey game that happens – always.”

Medical waivers. Masks. Virtual showings. Seven-figure purchases, sight unseen.

Home buying and selling has seen a head-snapping shift during the COVID-19 era, as both parties deal with the demands of physical distancing, virtual showings and previously unheard-of safety considerations.

One thing that hasn’t changed is the competition: Most major Canadian markets are as buoyant as ever after a brief slump and in defiance of gloomy forecasts about the impact the pandemic could have on real estate activity.

Story continues below advertisement

But the nuts and bolts of the process – how buyers and sellers interact and how realtors work with both – looks dramatically different than it did a few months ago, forcing years’ worth of sales innovation into just a few months.

Here are a few of the biggest changes:

Say goodbye to open houses

So much for perusing open houses as a weekend pastime. Physical distancing brought group showings to an abrupt halt this spring. As restrictions eased nationwide, open houses slowly started up again. In Ontario, for example, the province lifted its prohibition in most areas on July 17 as part of its Stage 3 reopening.

Still, open houses are nowhere near as common as they once were. Sellers remain wary of inviting large groups of people to traipse through their homes and some renters’ groups have spoken out against them as well.

“Before you could have upwards of two or three different agents with groups, at any given time, showing the same property,” says Darren Josephs, a Toronto Re/Max agent. “Now, the windows are 15-to-30 minutes and no overlap.”

Also, each client goes through individually, following sanitizing protocols before and after each visit. And there’s no such thing as dropping in with a moment’s notice, Mr. Josephs says.

“I think a lot of people were never entirely comfortable with open houses, especially sellers,” he says. “I think we’ll see a real long-term effect from this and more qualified showings, which tend to weed out people who aren’t serious.”

Story continues below advertisement

Vancouver-based independent realtor Chris Strand says there’s a “split in the realtor community” on the issue. He points out that realtors can often pick up new clients at open houses. However, he agrees that a decline in open houses – at least as we once knew them – may be one of the biggest long-term changes to emerge from the pandemic.

Better digital sales tools

The era of out-of-focus photos and sparse online listings is over, according to Patti Ross, a Royal LePage realtor in Halifax.

“You’ve always seen listings and asked, ‘Why are the photos so bad?’” she says. “We were proactive in my brokerage years ago in stepping up online marketing and building a photography and video department and it’s really paying off now.”

Open this photo in gallery Mr. Strand says a rise in virtual house touring may be due to the current bull market in housing. DARRYL DYCK/The Globe and Mail

Realtors have also long been limited in the number of photographs they can use on listings but, from coast-to-coast, those limits have been bumped up, allowing potential buyers to get a better sense of a property before arranging a viewing.

“Our real estate board just upped our photo count from 20 to 40,” Mr. Strand says, “and we’re seeing more people hiring professional videographers and using virtual walk-through tools.”

Sometimes that means 360-degree photos tours and, for high-end properties, it can mean full-blown immersive 3D renders of a property’s interior. That can help drive more selective, qualified showings, and fewer potential buyers arranging a viewing out of curiosity, only to show up and quickly realize the property isn’t right for them.

Story continues below advertisement

More safety protocols

When in-person viewings do take place, safety has become a top priority. In most cases, realtors will go into homes in advance, opening every door, cabinet and cupboard for clients.

“We ask that visitors treat the house like a museum,” Mr. Josephs says. “No touching.”

Potential buyers sign waivers attesting to their lack of COVID-19 symptoms and international travel. And everyone – buyers, sellers and agents – wear masks and keep the mandated two-metre distance.

Even Ms. Ross’ photographers and videographers make sure their gear is sanitized before it enters a property and they clean it thoroughly once they leave.

Some realtors hope that better safety protocols can instill more confidence in sellers to list their homes.

Major markets nationwide are currently grappling with a serious imbalance between supply and demand, as buyers return to the market in droves, but sellers remain shy. ""

Story continues below advertisement

You definitely see people waiting or holding off on listing,” Ms. Ross says. “But once you talk to people and tell them about process, they feel better.”

More risk-taking

That imbalance between buyers and sellers has also made markets more competitive. In Halifax, Ms. Ross recently sold one suburban property listed at $229,000 for $55,000 over asking, after entertaining more than 30 offers. In Vancouver, Mr. Strand is seeing similar activity, as is Mr. Josephs in Toronto, where he recently sold one home for $350,000 over asking, after 26 offers.

More buyers are also signing off on purchases remotely. In June, Nanos Research conducted a poll for the Ontario Real Estate Association that revealed 42 per cent of buyers were open to buying a home even if they could only see it online beforehand.

Ms. Ross says she’s noticed more buyers willing to purchase places sight unseen. (Atlantic Canada’s current self-isolation restrictions for out-of-region travellers mean visiting the region to house-hunt is especially impractical).

“We’re doing virtual tours that allow people to shop from Ontario or Vancouver,” she says, “and walk through the house remotely.”

She’s also begun doing walk-through video tours of neighbourhoods. A video tour showcasing sports facilities and outdoor trails near one property recently helped seal the deal with one out-of-province family.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Strand is seeing the same kind of activity in Vancouver.

“We’re using FaceTime, and I’ve had potential buyers from Ontario, Alberta, and several from Hong Kong,” he says.

Mr. Strand says some of that activity may be due to the current bull market in housing. But most industry watchers, including major banks and the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation, are still forecasting at least a modest decline in home prices over the coming year. As sellers re-enter the market, spiralling prices may well simmer down – good news for buyers already struggling with deteriorating affordability.

But even if markets re-balance, there seems little doubt that COVID-19 will result in lasting changes to the way Canadians buy and sell homes.

“Anything could happen in the next few months,” Mr. Strand says. “We’re all just waiting to see what sticks as we keep going through this and what goes back to the way it was before.”"

With pandemic restrictions in full force in late March and in-person visits limited, listing agent Michael St. Jean opted to expand his online photo gallery for this 1½-storey house.

“We typically get a lot of photos, but once the pandemic hit, we started taking photos of the furnace, electrical panels and even the basement walls and things of that nature for people to get a look at the mechanical elements,” Mr. St. Jean said.

“And not just for the buyers, but for appraisers who were not willing to go inside.”

After two weeks on the market, the asking price was cut by $10,000. That move paid off and negotiations with a potential buyer began in late April. “We’re pretty aggressive with reductions if we don’t find we’re getting the [desired] level of activity in the first 12 to 14 days, especially in that price bracket,” Mr. St. Jean said.

“It’s not easy to find homes any more in the $300,000s, so we felt comfortable no matter what the situation. We knew the demand was strong in this category of housing and price point.”

This mid-century home on a 43-foot-by-135-foot lot has 952 square feet of living space, with an updated kitchen and bathroom, as well as a new laminate flooring in the living and dining room.

By the stairs leading up to two out of three bedrooms is an exit to the private backyard and two-car parking.

The agent’s take

“These are older homes on big lots in a nice east-end neighbourhood close to the highways, golf courses and amenities,” Mr. St. Jean said.

“There were some updates done – it’s not your total fixer upper – so a buyer could come in and build on the things that have been done.”

Open this photo in gallery Robin Pope of Pope Real Estate Ltd. says two-storey units like this come on the market 'every couple of years.' Pope Real Estate Ltd.

As a concession to the COVID-19 pandemic, masks and hand sanitizer were provided to visitors of this newly renovated corner penthouse. But the seller – an interior designer – resisted suggestions that she accept a deep discount on the price, holding fast to her asking price for two months. After about 40 interested buyers had inspected the space, she finally agreed to an offer $55,500 below asking.

“Because of COVID, there were a lot of people who thought to make a low-ball [offer],” agent Robin Pope said. “But there was no market data to support that, nor was there any market data to support that it was a buyers’ market.

“It was a lovely property, so I was confident we would find someone, and my client also had lots of time and wasn’t prepared to give it away either.”

The Robert Watson Lofts is actually two buildings; one a former commercial building converted into lofts and the other a newly built structure with loft-like units. This 1,434-square-foot space is in the new building, and has polished concrete floors, 21-foot ceilings and a wraparound balcony facing south.

The seller installed a Scavolini kitchen, renovated the two bathrooms and removed a fireplace between the living and dining areas. The second floor has also divided to create two separate bedrooms.

The unit comes with laundry facilities, a storage locker and parking. Monthly fees of $1,108 pay for water and heating, plus recreation amenities, including a rooftop deck.

“A [two-storey] unit like this would come on the market every couple of years because this was so big. Most of what comes on the market would be smaller,” Mr. Pope said.

“And because the soft lofts are in the rear building, the views were better, so … it had a sweeping 180-degree view from downtown to all of Roncesvalles.”

This 10-year-old semi-detached house has been on the market for over a year, listed with several agents. To offset its location next to commercial businesses and high inventory levels in the neighbourhood, agent Kelsey Jones gave the house a stylish makeover and priced it under $500,000.

Complicating matters, COVID-19 kept buyers away, despite the sellers moving out and strict showing protocols.

“We came to market on March 10, the same week the Alberta government started to impose restrictions and just days before the City of Calgary declared its state of local emergency,” Ms. Jones said.

Story continues below advertisement

“The sense of fear in the marketplace had already begun, so we knew we had to really get competitive on pricing if we hoped to have a chance of selling at all. We did end up implementing one price reduction to $489,800 to keep some action on the property and encourage showings.”

What they got

The 1,625-square-foot house has three-bedrooms and an additional 775 square feet of living space in the finished basement. There’s also a double garage on the 25-foot-by-125-foot lot.

Interior finishes have been upgraded, with granite kitchen counters, new hardwood flooring and a gas fireplace in the living and dining area.

There’s an office, four bathrooms and a laundry room upstairs.

The agent’s take

“How buyers viewed spaces during this time quickly changed,” Ms. Jones said.

“All of the sudden you needed a property where you had space for an office, a place to roll out a yoga mat or complete an at-home workout with gyms and yoga studios shut, and of course a yard so that you could step out and get some fresh air and maybe grow a few vegetables with a lot of the parks being shut down. This home offered the space to do it all.”

“When we dropped it by $10,000 to about $465,000, that, along with the timing of things opening up and people starting to relax a bit, was a magical combination,” agent Amit Dhawan said.

“The crazy thing is there were larger bachelors available in this Fort York complex asking a much lower price.

After the pandemic struck in March, a few residents of the Norris Crescent Co-op lost their jobs and found themselves facing a world of financial uncertainty.

The co-op board snapped into action, offering up No Frills gift cards, a payment plan for missed rent cheques, and, perhaps most importantly, reassurance.

“We said no one would get evicted,” says board president Sharon Power, who has lived on Norris Crescent, in south Etobicoke, for about 15 years.

Sitting on a lawn chair outside her apartment, she watches cyclists ride by and casts an indulgent eye over the little community – 56 apartments ranging in size from one bedroom to four bedrooms, arrayed across ten two-storey post-war dwellings on a Mimico cul-de-sac abutting a lakefront park. There are about 200 residents, some of them very long-term, with a mix of incomes and ethnicities. In exchange for amazingly affordable rents ($1,600 is the highest), all are expected to participate somehow, from volunteering on the board to picking up stray mail.

Co-op living “is not without its challenges, I’m going to be honest,” Ms. Power says with a smile, allowing that everyone knows everyone else’s business. But, she adds, “[it] can be very rich. You have to have the intentionality of being an engaged member.”

In the past few years, engagement has also meant confronting the declining state of the buildings, which need new roofs, foundation repairs and building envelope upgrades. The co-op board, however, is also looking at redeveloping part of its landholdings – in effect replacing two of the houses closest to Lakeshore Road with a six-to-eight storey accessible mid-rise, with 35 to 50 units.

The board has hired a planning consultant to guide the members through the maze of zoning approvals and potential funding sources. Ms. Power points out that the plan also means that rents will have to rise by about 5 per cent to make the math work.

It’s a slow process, with plenty of risk for the co-op. As she says, “There’s got to be an easier way to assist co-ops with working through development plans.”

In spite of the speed bumps, Norris’ story offers a glimpse at what seems to be a bit of a renaissance in co-op housing development in Canada, especially in British Columbia and Quebec (see sidebar), where creative land and financing deals are bringing new projects online.

Tim Ross, executive director of the Co-op Housing Federation of Canada, says about 250,000 Canadians now live in affordable co-ops ranging in size from single apartment buildings to collections of low-rise dwellings. He knows from his members that demand, especially for family-suitable units, far exceeds supply.

Story continues below advertisement

The bulk of Canada’s co-ops date to the 1970s and 1980s, when the federal government pumped rent supplements and mortgage subsidies into these projects as an alternative to both private multi-unit residential slab towers and social housing complexes. At the time, they were seen as a progressive form of mixed-income urban housing.

Yet, with the subsequent surge of condo development, plus government decisions from the mid-1990s onward to phase out co-op subsidies, there’s been scant co-op development in the past 20 years. Mr. Ross says some co-op boards want to expand their portfolios or intensify, as in the case of Norris, but are held back by soaring real estate prices and forbidding development costs.

In B.C., however, affordable housing grants from the provincial NDP government and the City of Vancouver’s 2012 decision to transfer real estate at effectively no cost to community land trusts has meant that about 2,000 new affordable units will be built by 2023, about 70 per cent of them co-ops.

The first 350 are under construction, with one co-op in Vancouver’s River District set to open in August, according to Thom Armstrong, CEO of the Co-op Housing Federation of B.C. (CHFBC). Key to the plan has been low-cost loans from CMHC and a $2-million investment by VanCity, the credit union, to establish a properly capitalized development group to acquire assets and manage the process.

Open this photo in gallery Providence Ridge, a non-profit housing development in Kelowna, B.C., 54 townhomes acquired by the CLT in 2001. Co-operative Housing Federation of B.C.

Mr. Armstrong adds that CHFBC has been able to snap up derelict and virtually insolvent co-ops in places such as Port Moody and Port Coquitlam, invest in significant upgrades, and then transfer the ownership to a community land trust that is a subsidiary of the federation.

The last step means the property is not only removed from the private market in perpetuity, but becomes an asset that can be leveraged to acquire other parcels. (The Cooperative Housing Federation of Toronto also controls five land trusts that provide housing for 10,000 people living in 32 co-ops across the city.)

Decades of municipal land-banking can provide a steady source of real estate that co-ops can develop, Mr. Armstrong says. “There’s an enormous opportunity going forward.”

It appears that similar opportunities are cropping up in Toronto, as well.

Earlier this month, Toronto city council approved a deal with Streetcar Developments to upgrade an old house at 685 Queen St. E., near Broadview Avenue, which belongs to the Riverdale Co-op and has nine apartments. Located next to a Toyota dealership slated for redevelopment by Streetcar, the building will be expanded to 26 units, including complete upgrades of the original nine apartments.

Riverdale’s manager Adene Kuchera says the co-op owns 28 properties in the east end, with 124 units – mostly duplexes, triples and walk-ups. It was founded in 1974 and expanded until the 1980s, but the board hasn’t acquired new units since then. About half of its properties are mortgage free, Ms. Kuchera says.

While earlier proposals envisioned up to 80 units and 12 storeys, the scale was unrealistic. The project will be constructed by Streetcar, which is contributing $5.2-million in Section 37 grants, with another $11.2-million coming from waivers on city fees and taxes. Construction is expected to begin next year.

The number of proposed units was reduced shortly before the project landed at council so Streetcar wouldn’t risk neighbourhood objections or re-zoning appeals – a decision that brought criticism from some affordable housing watchers. But Councillor Paula Fletcher defended the compromise, saying it provides Riverdale’s board with financial certainty. “This has not been the easiest application.”

She points out that new-build co-ops are also envisioned for other development sites in the area, including a large mixed-income Toronto Community Housing complex being intensified by RioCan.

With evidence of deal flow in Canada’s two most expensive cities, co-op advocates are hoping that some of funding pledged under the Liberal government’s much touted National Housing Strategy will stoke the development of more co-op projects. But Tim Ross says the program remains “difficult to access.”

Adds Jon Harstone, a veteran affordable housing consultant who has managed the development or expansion several Toronto co-op projects, “Unless the feds put money into non-profits, this will all be one-offs.”

Montreal’s Student Co-op Housing Renaissance

Laurent Levesque founded Utile, a student housing co-op development non-profit, in 2012 when he was still a planning undergrad at the Université du Quèbec à Montreal (UQAM), largely out of a desire to put his learning to good use.

Seven years later, the group’s first co-op venture, The Woodnote, at Concordia University, is set to open in September. The $18-million, 90-unit project, designed by Rayside Labossière, is backed by the Concordia student union and a pair of provincial student organizations, among other investors.

The units range in size from studios to four-bedroom suites, all fully fitted out with modern amenities instead of the dorm-style housing that’s far more common on and around Canadian campuses. Woodnote will accommodate up to 140 students. A second and larger Montreal project from Utile will open in 2022.

Unusually for co-ops, Utile’s ventures involve no provincial funding. What Utile has done is forge financial partnerships involving several credit unions, which tend to have social responsibility investment mandates, and student organizations that can provide a steady stream of revenues through a dedicated levy.

The City of Montreal offered a $1.6-million grant, and Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. supplied a $3-million loan. The financing allowed Utile to buy land for both projects. Woodnote, in fact, is located in Montreal’s desirable Plateau area.

The organization operates as the developer, providing the expertise that has been lacking in the student co-op housing world for years, says Mr. Levesque. “You need a development organization to make projects like these work.”

He sees both projects as “proof of concept” developments that offer an alternative vehicle for delivering higher-density student housing complexes, which are typically contracted out to private developers by university administrators.

Mr. Levesque points out that Utile is working on several student housing co-op projects outside Quebec, all of which are still in the early stages. “There’s no secret recipe. Our model is completely scalable and replicable across the country.”

Lounging on the leather couch, positioned in front of a 12-foot high window, we watch the summer thunder storm, and its accompanying winds bustle through the tree tops. As I take a slug of my local IPA, the rain whips at the window, coming horizontally in bursts and the tops of the surrounding pines thrash violently, “but see, no movement, totally stable,” Cam Green says. “You wouldn’t know that we’re in a tree house, would you.”

Yes, kind of like Tarzan, we are at home in the trees. Thirteen feet above ground, we’re sat in the main living space of a splendidly luxurious tree house. At 370 square feet, with an additional 210 if you include the outdoor deck space, this home-on-high, this tree fort for grown ups, is the brainchild of Mr. Green and his partner, Lauren. Costing a cool $300,000, the structure, near Minden, Ont., includes a full bathroom with flushing toilet and shower. There’s a king-size bed high in the mezzanine, and the aforementioned living space, which is climate controlled with a heat recovery ventilator, includes sofa, coffee table and propane stove, plus a kitchen area complete with fridge and space for food preparation.

Mr. Green has been fascinated by building in trees since his childhood. “Borrowing” materials from the burn pile behind his parent’s cottage on Balsam Lake, he and his buddies would knock together tree houses in the bush, much like many other kids. But, while others grew up and forgot about their aerial construction projects, Mr Green’s interest in architecture and the potential for building in trees blossomed. In 2014 he took a course in sustainable tree house design and construction, at the Yestermorrow Design Build School, in Waitsfield, Vt. “We learned how to build the specialized foundation structure that you need to support a tree house in a growing tree,” Mr. Green says. “I’d always wanted to turn my dreams into a reality and now I had the skills to do it.”

But, time has a way of getting away on you and it wasn’t until 2019 that the couple could begin their build. The design, by Mr. and Ms. Green, and overseen by B.C. architectural designer Lindsay Duthie of Lindsay Duthie Design Studio, is a tale of two parts. Mr. Green focused on the structural and engineering aspects, while Mrs Green undertook the interior and aesthetic design of the building.

Most critical was the attachment to the two red maple trees, which support half of the building’s weight. Specially engineered for the project by Oregon-based tree house guru, Charlie Greenwood, the tree house attachment bolts (TABs) are a dynamic fixing that runs right through the heart of the tree. The rod and bolt system supports two steel arms that carry heavy I beams, on which the main structural members of the wooden floor system sit. Additionally, three steel posts support the rear of the building, keeping it totally stable.

“The most important element on this kind of project is, of course, the trees,” Mr. Green says. “And with that in mind you must work clean. By that I mean that no dirt or foreign bodies can be allowed to get into the wound that you create in the tree while installing the TAB because they have the potential to infect and damage the tree.”

To this end every cutting and boring tool was sanitized, holes were cleaned out and sanitized as soon as cut and a paint-on sealant that helps the trees heal applied as soon as the TABs were in place.

“The tree is kind of your reason for building a tree house,” Mr. Green says, “so protecting it is paramount. Even the ground under it was covered with wood chips and plywood while heavy construction took place. We wanted to be sure not to damage or compact the roots.”

The deck on which the building is constructed is massive. Three large 13-inch-by-7-inch glued laminated timbre beams form the foundation, upon which Douglas fir joists, each 4 inches by 12 inches are laid. All “float” 13 feet above the forest floor. From here on up, to its 33-foot tall peak, the tree house is a fairly conventional stick frame build.

“The only differences are the corrugated steel structure of the wall around the big window, to stop deflection, and the fact that we used screws instead of nails so that they wouldn’t pop due to any unforeseen movement,” Mr. Green says.

Aesthetically, the vibe is all clean, modern lines with a “woodsy” twist. This is where Ms. Green comes into her own. Cedar is the predominant material externally: the deck, penny joint siding and privacy screens for the outdoor shower, all hewn from the hard wearing wood. Invisible glass handrails border the deck, giving a real sense of being truly among the trees. Inside, the cool grey of the straw and clay floor – a super environmentally friendly product, laid by a local artisan – is complimented by Baltic birch plywood paneled walls and ceiling.

“Lauren has a great eye for this kind of design. I just do the grunt work,” Mr. Green says with a laugh.

Signature pieces, such as the mini propane stove and ladder to the mezzanine, are black, adhering to a minimal colour pallet informed by the window and door frames. The bathroom, too, is all dark tones; the hexagonal floor tiles and almost mirror-like black wall tiles contrasting nicely with the quirky, black trimmed white enamel sink.

A chunky leather couch and woollen throw rug soften the aesthetic and add a cozy feel to the living space, which will be especially welcome in winter months, when the family is really looking forward to living amidst the snow blanketed forest.

The Greens have managed to successfully turn a life long ambition into a reality, and a burgeoning business opportunity, as their new tree house building company, Fort Treehouse Co., gets off the ground (if you’ll pardon the pun) with the completion of this wonderful build.

As for the couple’s two boys – Arlo, who is two, and Sidney, just weeks old – as they grow up they’ll have the best tree house in town. But, it’s a safe bet that dad will be helping them build their own, something more rough and ready like those from his childhood, soon enough.

The back story

Open this photo in gallery There is a massive stone fireplace into the main living space. Denis St. Jean/Denis St. Jean

The street address for Bryan Osborn’s Lac Tremblant home is misleading: It says the house is on Chemain Desmarais, but in fact it’s about 600 metres further down a private road marked as Impasse des Cascades on the map. There are only five or six other homes on this lane.

“There’s a long meandering drive through the forest following a cascading creek,” said Mr. Osborn. “You go over a post-and-beam bridge and come to our entrance Down the driveway and past the tennis court is the house, perched on the lakefront next to a private bay. The family calls the land Deer Point.

“When we built here, a couple guys who were happy to have the work told me, ‘This is our favourite place to hunt deer,’ Back then, you could hunt around the lake. But you can’t anymore.” The was once bare land, part of a larger lot belonging to the family of a friend from his youth. “When we had our first place on the lake, many years later, we rekindled our old relationship. I told him, if ever you want to chop off some of your property ... Many years later, he called me. ‘We’ve decided to sell the point... we know you we’d like to have you as the neighbour,’” Mr. Osborn said. The result was a 4.2 acre lot, much of it flat, with 750 feet of lake frontage.

Mr. Osborn knew what he wanted on the land: a post and beam home done to his specifications. He worked with a crew who had trained in British Columbia, making use of the massive fir forests for materials, before returning home to Quebec to set up a construction business. “Originally, we built it as a country home,” he said. “The kids spent summers and weekends here.” About 20 years ago, he sold his industrial packaging business and made Deer Point his home base, but he has kept busy with his passion for post and beam homes.

Among his post-retirement projects was a run as a custom-home developer. On nearby Lac Ouimet, he acquired land and worked out an arts-and-craft style template that allowed for some customization, building three homes to demonstrate his approach. Eventually he built and sold 22 homes at the Belvedere Estates, the last one in 2008, leaning heavily on locally-sourced artisans just as he had with Deer Point.

“Anybody that has the means wants to be on Lac Tremblant,” says Steven Lafave, listing agent and managing director of the Engel & Völkers Tremblant business (who also lives on an island in the 14 km long lake). “Lac Tremblant owners are full-timers or every weekenders; we’ve got a mix of sports figures and celebrities ... the usual suspects, some of the most affluent families from eastern Canada. Other families have owned properties for a long time. There’s the odd one, the über top of the food chain families like the Stroll family flying in on helicopters.” (Lawrence Stroll, Quebec billionaire investor (an early backer in Michael Kors) owns the Circuit Mont-Tremblant raceway and the F1 team Racing Point (to be renamed Aston Martin in 2021) which also employs his son Lance Stroll as a driver.

Some of the newer homes on the lake are palaces, 15,000- to 25,000- square feet, which is a little more than Mr. Osborn’s 6,500 square foot, four-bed and five-bath house. “We’ve had people come and want to buy the house and say it’s “big ‚and small,” he said. “‘If it only had five bedrooms instead of four.’” He’s in no rush to sell though (the house has been on the market since 2018). He said he’s looking for the discerning buyer.

The house today

Open this photo in gallery There are four bedrooms. Denis St. Jean/Denis St. Jean

The house is laid out on a centre-hall plan, with A-shaped frame that’s as big and open as a barn with wings on both sides. The front door sits at the middle of that central hall, a generous foyer looks into that hall, through the massive stone fireplace into the main living space. Just through the foyer is a landing that runs between the wings. On the right are the stairs to the basement, and a wing that contains two bedrooms. On the left is the wing that leads to the main bedroom and attached living quarters.

Step around the fireplace, down into a great room with a vaulting 20 foot-high ceiling. If it wasn’t already clear from the outside, this house is all about wood and the openness and light that is achieved by post and beam construction.

“We researched the wood, it came from Maine ... we wanted a particular white pine and we needed specific trees to make 12 by 12 square beams that were 40 feet long,” said Mr. Osborn. “We didn’t waste any other materials that were cut [some ended up in flooring or other trim finishings].”

Open this photo in gallery Showings typically involve a boat ride. Denis St. Jean/Denis St. Jean

Everywhere is pine, which has mellowed to a deep golden, it frames doors and windows, some walls and ceilings are panelled in it, everywhere the beams can be exposed they are. The craftsmanship is exceptional.

“And all of the interior finishings were made in various woodworking shops in the Laurentians. All our cabinetry, designed by a designer but fabricated in these artisan wood shops,” said Mr. Osborn. “Case in point, the doors are all two inches thick. You can’t put spindly little doors in a house with structural beams. The floors are made with same white pine, wide-plank, also two inches thick.”

Everything radiates out from central great room, the lake-side wall is practically all glass with three sets of glass double doors and with four massive triangular window panes above them that accentuate the A-shaped framing. The dining space sits just next to those windows, a sitting area sits between that the fireplace. A breakfast bar on the left runs along the raised counter that separates the room from the kitchen.

“We sit on our dock and watch the sunrise, most people on our side of the lake have to wait until 10 or 11 because the mountain is behind us and the sun comes up over the mountain,” said Mr. Osborn. But because the point extends into the small bay you can have unobstructed views of that morning light.

That’s part of the reason Mr. Lafave’s showings typically involve a boat ride, often picking the interested party up at the lakeside Hotel Quintessence. “If we don’t bring them in by boat we’ll end up on boat. It’s part of the process,” Mr. Lafave said, in part to show them how Deer Point’s land and location compares to the other lots on the lake. “We’ve got examples of people paying $4-million for a much lesser lot, going to build 15-20,000 square foot homes without flat land or bay or private road. In year’s past there were a few homes that were still available [to buy and tear down] now they are gone ... on that side of the lake with a road there are two options left; and they are both $10-million.”

The action

The owners of this detached house could not avoid listing it in late March, so their agent devised strict viewing protocols, increased cleanings between visitors and provided sanitation stations. After a couple of weeks of sluggish buyer turnout, the price was dropped by $127,000 in April.

“The [market] conditions weren’t the same it was the month previous, so we priced it to sell and we had five offers in two days,” agent Belinda Lelli said.

“The sellers made the decision to choose a lower-priced offer that was firm with a quick closing. The sellers did not want to take any unnecessary risks given the uncertainty of the real estate market during the COVID-19 market.”

What they got

Open this photo in gallery The rear sunroom exits to the south-facing backyard. Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.

This 2,128-square-foot house was built on a 30-foot-by-110-foot lot about 30 years ago, with formal living and dining rooms. It also as a family room with a gas fireplace above the double garage.

Casual lounging can also be done in the rear sunroom, which exits to a south-facing backyard, or the basement, which features open entertaining area and a second kitchen.

Upstairs, the largest of three bedrooms contains a walk-in closet and fourth bathroom.

The agent’s take

“An above average home inspection and a separate entrance to a fully finished basement helped to draw great interest, as the potential for rental income was attractive to the majority of buyers,” Ms. Lelli said.

“This home, situated on a quiet cul-de-sac, is ideal for young families. Schools, parks and shopping are also within walking distance, as is the local community/recreation centre.”

Buyers interested in this modern townhouse could check out a 48-page brochure and a time-lapse construction video before deciding whether they wanted an in-person tour in late April.

“Might we have had 30 plus showings in a typical market?” agent Paul Johnston asked. “I think so. But the 14 we did have didn’t disappoint us, because the people making the effort to see this home had genuine and thorough interest in it.”

“As this was a brand-new house, we sell those pretty much for the asking price. So the upside is you’re not going to pay more. But the downsize is, you’re not going to get a deal.”

“The two things that make it different is it’s a very small condominium with two homes, and it’s a modern semi,” Mr. Johnston said.

“Instead of being divided along the length of the lot, they’re more or less divided by the width of the lot, so … it’s a clever way of building because you get the benefit of a wide home with lots of windows and nice room sizes.”

“All the framing was done in a factory, so all the walls fit perfectly, arrived preinsulated and presheathed, and over the course of five days it was put up, so the benefit was the speed of construction, accuracy and nothing gets exposed to the elements,” Mr. Johnston said.

“These are really well designed, but they’re also environmentally sensitive homes.”

The back story

Jeanmarie and Chris Hulaj didn’t see themselves as retired. Instead, their new job was renovating their Victorian home – a process that hasn’t truly stopped as they are constantly tinkering with small upgrades.

Purchased five years ago, the house at 14576 Old Simcoe Rd. originally caught the couple’s eyes with its grand details. Despite the ceilings being dropped multiple times, they said they could tell then how high the original ceiling heights were: 11 feet in the lower level and 10 feet in the upper level. Meanwhile, the second floor boasts pine flooring over 140 years old. There is also a curved wall staircase.

“It was a beautiful Victorian house,” said Ms. Hulaj, a retired fashion designer and art teacher.

But it also had plenty of problems, as they would find out after attempting some initial redesign work.

“We were doing a lot of demolition and kept finding out more and more problems with the old house,” said Mr. Hulaj, who used to work in technology, including a stint at The Globe and Mail.

When the interior drywall and those dropped ceilings were removed, it was found that some of the exterior framing was already disintegrating, and there was no real insulation. The house’s galvanized piping and aged wiring also presented a problem with getting insurance. At the same time, the entire upstairs needed new framing because it “was open like a barn with no interior walls at all,” Ms. Hulaj recalled.

As a result, the couple had to replace all the wiring, plumbing, heating, venting and framing, before putting back the drywall and repainting the entire interior of the house.

Open this photo in gallery The extensive renovation involved reframing the home and repainting the entire interior. Lissa Veilleux/Lissa Veilleux (MAC Media)

“We were advised by different people just to sort of patch it up and sell it off as quickly as we could,” Mr. Hulaj said. “We just in good conscience couldn’t do a poor job of that. And we were planning to live here.”

They also couldn’t bear the thought of demolishing the house to build a new one.

“We couldn’t see the math in that one,” Ms. Hulaj said. “Like, why knock down such a beautiful house that has so much potential?”

Instead, they pressed on with their intensive renovation plan. It ultimately took four years, with breaks in between.

The house today

Open this photo in gallery The renovated home now features plenty of room for entertaining. Lissa Veilleux/Lissa Veilleux (MAC Media)

Inside the original Victorian shell, the now-revamped house offers plenty of space for living and entertaining.

There are four bedrooms on the second level, all with their own ensuite bathrooms. On the main floor, the fifth bathroom is attached to a sauna. There is also a spacious formal dining room that can entertain 15 people. Attached to it is a parlour, “a really sweet spot” where the couple likes to spend their evenings playing board games.

But with the couple both being enthusiastic cooks, even dearer to their hearts is the kitchen.

In the 17-by-14-foot room with a hardwood floor, a large granite-top island takes centre stage. The custom cabinetry with solid cherry doors surrounding the space were built by Mr. Hulaj himself.

“We cook in our kitchen almost every night,” Ms. Hulaj said. “We cook a lot of different foods and things that are really time-consuming, so you need a lot of space.”

Besides the main living spaces, there is a loft at the very top of the house and a big workshop space at the back of the detached garage.

The large lot spans 108-by-257 feet and includes an in-ground pool.

“It’s actually quite nice to go and sit around the pool,” Ms. Hulaj said.

“We try to knock off work about three o’clock – the work we’re still doing on the house and everything – and then we’ll just go on the zero-gravity chairs and we’re on vacation.”

Open this photo in gallery The large lot features an in-ground pool. Lissa Veilleux/Lissa Veilleux (MAC Media)

But the couple said all the space was too much for just the two of them, so they decided to profit from their love of cooking and open a bed and breakfast.

They started Century House 1879 B & B last summer by placing their bedrooms on Airbnb. With more than 100 bookings since, Ms. Hulaj said they have received mainly compliments about the house from guests – a sentiment reflected in their Airbnb reviews.

“People love the house. They love the character of the house and the one thing a lot of people say about my house is it has a really inviting feel and a very calming feel,” she said.

However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the couple have had to close down their bed and breakfast. And even though the province has started to reopen, they said physical-distancing measures would have disrupted the social atmosphere they like to foster between guests.

“We’d have to keep our guests separated, where we used to encourage them to socialize,” she said. “It would be running it in different way than we would normally run it and we didn’t feel comfortable with that.”

And with no immediate end in sight for the pandemic to restart the bed and breakfast, the couple said it’s time for them to move on and let others experience all that the house has to offer.

“We have two children, so it’s almost like when your children are growing up and you get to the point where you’ve done everything you can for them and it’s time for them to have other experiences,” Ms. Hulaj said. “And in this case, it’s time for someone else to experience this beautiful house.”

The listing agents had prepared a walkthrough video and 3-D dollhouse tour for this four-bedroom house less than 500 metres from Runnymede subway station and High Park. But in early June, upward of 70 potential buyers wanted a closer look, even if it meant travel and health disclosures, viewing restrictions and long wait times.

“There were times I couldn’t show my own listing,” agent Mark Oulahen said. “There were no overlapping appointments and 30-minute appointments max, so they just filled in.” In the end, he received 16 offers.

“Those often have either very small front private drives or a mutual drive that’s difficult to drive down, so this 50-foot lot allows … a private drive and a garage so you can fit three cars, and there’s still a wonderful backyard.”

The recent designer-lead makeover further elevated the property’s value. “They have a well constructed design and finish, and they spent some money on landscaping, which ties everything together,” Mr. Oulahen said.

Out of country buyers sought an older, but renovated home with a two-car garage and an address near family and friends residing in Riverdale. Although they largely considered detached homes, their virtual visit of this semi-detached candidate near Withrow Park pushed them to outbid another interested party in mid-May.

“I thought it was underpriced, so when [the sellers] got an offer immediately, I wasn’t surprised,” the buyers’ agent Pierre Carapetian said.

“The house was brand new and renovated, so my clients decided to forgo the inspection to make their offer stronger.”

Brought to you by At Home is a five-part series that asks Canadians to share what home ownership means to them from the perspective of the head and the heart. Contemplating making upgrades to your home? Advice from an HSBC mortgage specialist can help make it happen.

When Heather and Wesley Corbett bought their home in New Westminster, B.C., 13 years ago, they weren’t gardeners.

With two young sons at the time, the couple wanted a yard, but they didn’t imagine it would become their sanctuary.

“The garden is really what we’ve put our hearts into. I don’t think either my husband or I knew that we would get so much joy from the effort we put in,” says Heather, 44.

“We regularly take a drink and go on a tour of the garden. It sounds funny, but we just go and see how the plants are doing and we walk around and observe what’s growing and what’s blooming, and it really is something we love doing together.”

The garden has also been a relaxing place for the family to spend time during the pandemic.

“We’ve done a lot of work on the garden,” Heather says of the past few months as COVID-19 health measures have forced people to stay home.

Before renewing their mortgage in May, the Corbetts considered whether it was time to move into a bigger home.

“Every time we come back to the fact that we don’t really want to leave the area or the garden. So, we said, ‘no, let’s not,’” Heather says.

Public health guidance encouraging people to stay home has also allowed time for her husband, 51, to build a basketball hoop with one son and a lawn game with the other.

“They had fun doing that together,” she says. “I’ve certainly been very grateful for the fact that we have our house and our yard.”

Heather grew up in Vancouver. When the couple moved back home after a stint in the United Kingdom, they realized they couldn’t afford a house in that city, so broadened their search to the suburbs.

New Westminster appealed to them because of its history, small-town feel and location on the banks of the Fraser River.

They found a house with “good bones,” a good school nearby and a ton of potential. They took possession in the fall of 2007.

“We maybe didn’t know it at the time, but our community is a huge factor for us. We really appreciate where we live and the tight-knit, close community that we are a part of,” Heather says.

The house needed work, though. In 2010, spurred by low-interest rates and big ideas, the Corbetts refinanced their mortgage to be able to take on an extensive renovation. They added a two-storey addition to the back of the house and a deck.

Even after paying the penalty for getting out of their five-year mortgage early, the rates made the investment worthwhile.

“We went from quite a high-interest rate to a really low-interest rate,” Heather says.

The house that cost about $460,000 in 2007 has since more than doubled in value. While it was a big investment at the time, the Corbetts have never second-guessed their decision to buy in the Metro Vancouver market.

Wesley is a graphic designer who has worked from home for many years. Heather is a committee clerk for the City of New Westminster. With the entire family now at home during the lockdown, there’s enough room for everyone to have their own space.

The Corbetts’ lenders have also provided the couple very favourable lines of credit over the years, along with the mortgage.

“It has come in handy,” she says of the lines of credit, “to get us through some tight spots [and with] different things we wanted to do to the house.”

Having a home-equity line of credit (HELOC) is a good idea and can be used for a wide-range of uses, from home renovations to helping with the cost of a child’s education, says Matt Mercer, Head of the Mortgage Centre at HSBC Bank Canada in Toronto.

“A HELOC is one option to finance expected and unexpected expenses at a low-interest cost,” Matt says. “The benefit of a HELOC is that it allows you to use your hard-earned equity without having to requalify each time, and because you are not breaking your mortgage early, there is no penalty.”

He recommends homeowners discuss their wants and needs with a mortgage specialist, who will help them find the best solution to match their unique circumstances.

“The mortgage specialist will review your full situation, including your current mortgage rate, other obligations that you have, and any future plans and financing needs,” Matt says.

The garden is really what we’ve put our hearts into. I don’t think either my husband or I knew that we would get so much joy from the effort we put in. HEATHER CORBETT

What advice to the Corbetts have for other homeowners?

Heather recommends they start by making a list of what will make them happy. For instance, she and her husband knew they didn’t want the hassle of traversing any bridges or tunnels on their daily commute.

“That was our rule. We stuck to it and have never regretted it,” Heather says.

And put some time into researching potential neighbourhoods, she says. You may not be able to afford your first choice, but you can make sure you’ll be happy in an area you can afford.

“I drove around a lot of areas to get a feel for what the community was like and also what kind of future it had,” she says.

When they moved in, there were very few amenities nearby, but before they bought, she found out there were plans for a retail development nearby. They now have a grocery store, drug store, restaurant and Starbucks within walking distance.

“Make sure you’re going to be happy there and there’s going to be the ability to work and play,” Heather says.

Matt of HSBC cautions that everyone’s situation is unique.

“What worked for the Corbett’s might not work for you,” he says. “That’s why it’s important to work with a bank – like HSBC – that has a team of mortgage specialists that can help you understand your current situation and put a plan in place to turn your dreams into a reality.”

With the uncertainty of COVID-19 still looming over the Canadian economy, it may not seem like a great time to start tinkering with something as fundamental to your economic security as your mortgage. But with interest rates at historic lows, more Canadian homeowners are wondering if refinancing their mortgage may actually put them on a path to greater economic security.

In March, in a bid to stoke an economy hit hard by pandemic-related shutdowns, the Bank of Canada lowered its policy interest rate — also known as the overnight rate, which is the interest rate at which major financial institutions borrow and lend for one day — to a record low of 0.25 per cent. (Changes in the overnight rate influence interest rates for consumer loans and mortgages).

The move had the desired effect, and then some. Even as new home sales nosedived in spring, refinancing inquiries surged and remained elevated as the housing market rapidly recovered through the late spring and summer.

“If your rate is significantly above two per cent, I would look into trying to take advantage of these rates, because in many cases it makes great sense,” says Jamie Golombek, managing director of tax and estate planning at CIBC Private Wealth Management.

Traditionally, Mr. Golombek explains, most homeowners have been unlikely to realize any significant savings by breaking a mortgage and switching lenders. Any modest savings are typically negated by hefty penalties for breaking the mortgage contract. But rates have now dropped so low that the conventional wisdom is being revised.

“But before you break a mortgage,” Mr. Golombek cautions, “you need to do the math — and the biggest issue is the break fee.”

The break fee for variable-rate mortgages will generally come to three months’ worth of interest. For fixed-rate loans, it will be the greater of three months’ interest or the interest-rate differential. The latter is where it gets a little complicated — and where you’ll want to seek professional advice.

The interest-rate differential is the difference between the rate when you signed your mortgage and what you would pay if the rest of your mortgage term was refinanced at today’s rates. It will vary slightly from lender-to-lender and province-to-province, but can quickly add up.

Figuring out what exactly it will work out to can be tricky, says Mr. Golombek, who recommends using a mortgage advisor to help with the calculations. Fortunately, he adds, “you can usually just speak to them and ask them to calculate it for you.” Or you can approach a new lender to seek advice.

Right now, CIBC is making it easy to get personalized mortgage advice remotely and safely, with mobile mortgage advisors available by phone or secure video conference to help walk through some of the more complicated aspects of refinancing.

Story continues below advertisement

Another factor to consider is incentives. Until Oct. 31, CIBC is offering cash back of up to $3,000 for borrowers who switch their mortgage, to help offset the expense of switching.

“It’s an offer dependent on the size of the mortgage,” Mr. Golombek says.

For example, he says you can receive $1,200 for a mortgage between $300,000 and $500,000 and up to $3,000 for a mortgage over $750,000.

“And that can be used to apply to the interest rate differential,” he says, “if your rate was 3.5 per cent from a few years ago and now you can get two per cent — that’s a huge difference, especially with the cashback.”

There are some other factors to consider before you switch: You won’t be able to coast into a new mortgage without proving to a new lender that you’re credit-worthy, which can mean another credit check. And, besides the break fee, there are also some legal and administrative costs associated with refinancing.

If the numbers don’t quite work out, there are other ways to take advantage of low rates, such as switching a blended mortgage that combines the rate you’re currently paying with today’s lower rates, for one that falls somewhere in the middle. This can be a good middle option, letting you stick with your current lender and take at least partial advantage of the new rate environment.

Whatever path you choose, borrowers who’ve never given a second thought to refinancing may never find a better time to revisit the idea.

What if life insurance wasn’t just about providing for loved ones after death? What if getting coverage came with associated benefits a policyowner could access throughout their lifetime? That’s the aim of participating life insurance from Canada Life™.

Participating life insurance, also called “par”, is a type of whole life insurance policy that offers a guaranteed payout and cash value, as well as the opportunity to participate in the experience of the par account through dividends. It’s another way clients can help build their wealth through tax-advantaged policy growth and potential dividends. On top of that, accumulated cash value within the policy can be withdrawn and used for anything from business opportunities to an emergency fund.

With par’s features and flexibility, advisors find that it helps meet the needs of a variety of different client segments, including business owners.

Story continues below advertisement

“This is a great product for business owners because it can provide a sense of security on a few different fronts,” says Andrea Frossard, senior vice-president of Par Insurance Solutions for Canada Life.

A key person protection strategy works well with Canada Life’s par products. The insurance payout, or death benefit, is guaranteed, meaning it will never decrease as long as premiums are paid. The payout can be used to help buy a partner’s shares or vice versa when someone dies.

“Participating life insurance for business owners provides lifelong coverage, which includes a tax-free payout to your company if you or your business partner dies,” Ms. Frossard says. “The money can help keep the business going, help a business partner pay off debts or can be used to reinvest in the business.”

But par goes beyond the death benefit side of the insurance policy. In business, as in life, there are often unforeseen financial surprises. If the funds aren’t there to handle those kinds of hiccups, it could mean financial trouble for any business. That’s where the cash value that builds over time in a par policy can come in and help a business owner.

“Par has guaranteed cash value built into the policy, as long as the premiums are paid,” Ms. Frossard says. “This accumulated cash value can be used while alive. And for business owners, this kind of emergency fund could be invaluable.”

How can business owners take advantage of accumulated cash value that builds in their policy?

“One option is to withdraw accumulated cash value in their par policy. They may be able to do this as early as the policy’s first anniversary, for whatever reason they want,” says Ms. Frossard.

Story continues below advertisement

That’s a welcome cushion to pay for life’s little – and big – surprises. Clients should be aware, though, that withdrawals may reduce the overall coverage within the policy and could be subject to taxes.

“can also borrow with interest against the accumulated cash value of their policy to use on anything from an emergency fund or an unforeseen opportunity,” Ms. Frossard says. “In contrast to cash value withdrawals, the benefit of this option is that it lets the cash value in the policy keep growing, as if it were untouched. If the loan isn’t repaid, the payout is reduced by the amount of the loan with interest.”

As another alternative, the accumulated cash value can be used as collateral for a third-party loan from a bank or other financial lender. “Interest charges may apply to any loan taken, but, depending on the lender, a collateral loan might come with a lower interest rate and interest may be tax deductible,” Ms. Frossard says.

One feature of par that business owners may also find appealing is the ability to make additional premium payments. That helps build up the policy’s death benefit and cash value faster than with standard par policy payments. “Again, business owners can think of this as accessible cash they can use in case of an emergency,” says Ms. Frossard.

If business owners find they don’t need to tap into the accumulated cash value during the life of their policy, they still have the assurance of knowing that the life insurance protection is there in the event of their death.

Whatever a business owner’s personal and business goals, participating life insurance is a powerful product in an advisor’s toolbox – one that’s built for the future, but also here for today.

Many investors are looking to diversify their risk tolerance beyond traditional securities and investment funds, but not expose themselves fully to the frequent ebbs and flows of the equity market. How can advisors best meet both goals?

One solution is participating life insurance, often shortened to “par.” It can be a valuable product in any long-term portfolio, offering some needed diversification, and policy value and growth that’s stable, with less volatility than equity investments.

Canada Life™ par products offer a solution to fulfil this need. Advisors can frame them for clients as whole life insurance products that feature a guaranteed life insurance payout on death. Plus, the opportunity to participate in the experience of the par account through dividends, have guaranteed cash value and gain tax advantages to boot when premiums are paid.

Story continues below advertisement

“Consumers buy life insurance to protect the people and organizations they care about after they die,” says Andrea Frossard, senior vice-president of Par Insurance Solutions for Canada Life. “The great thing about par is that with that protection comes important policy features like guaranteed cash value growth and the potential for dividends, which they can use while alive.”

For steady, long-term growth, Canada Life generally manages the participating account as a broadly diversified fixed-income account.

“The target asset mix for the participating account is about 75 per cent fixed-income investments and 25 per cent equities in order to balance risk and returns,” Ms. Frossard says. “We’re very careful and deliberate with our asset mix. Right now, our largest investment segment is high-quality bonds, all of which are investment grade or higher. We also further balance risk by incorporating insured mortgages to further manage risk and returns.”

Increased equity exposure could bring higher returns. However, it also introduces the policyowner to more market volatility.

“We also smooth investment experience,” Ms. Frossard says. “It means we bring in investment gains and losses into the dividend scale over time, which reduces volatility.”

Certain features of Canada Life’s par products separate it from other life insurance products, like term insurance. For example, advisors can talk to clients about the guaranteed cash value attached to the policy. It follows a set schedule where it can begin growing as early as year one.

“Whether it’s for an emergency or unforeseen opportunity, clients can access accumulated cash value in a number of ways,” says Ms. Frossard. “They can withdraw cash value, borrow from their policy or use it as collateral for a third-party loan.”

Story continues below advertisement

When accessing accumulated cash value, clients should be aware that withdrawals can reduce the final payout on death and might be taxable to the policyowner while living.

If clients don’t need to access their policy’s cash value and don’t make any cash value withdrawals, the final payout to the beneficiary won’t be affected. With or without withdrawals, the policy will continue to grow tax-advantaged (subject to government limits and assuming the policy is tax-exempt).

“Many clients may choose par for the tax-advantaged payout and cash value growth over the life of the policy. For example, for those who have already maxed out other tax-efficient investment alternatives like RRSPs and TFSAs, the tax advantages can be attractive,” Ms. Frossard says.

Another appealing feature of par is that it gives policyowners the ability to share, or “participate” in, the performance of the par account, which could result in dividend payments.

“When Canadians contribute to a participating life insurance policy, they’re pooling their money with others who are already contributing to that par account,” says Ms. Frossard. “We have over $41-billion in open par account assets. With that size comes advantages, like economies of scale, diversification and the ability to capitalize on investment opportunities not available to smaller accounts.

“Dividends are based on the experience of the participating account, but they aren’t guaranteed,” explains Ms. Frossard. Investment experience, among other things, plays an important role in the par account’s performance. Once dividends are paid, they’re vested.

Story continues below advertisement

“Vesting is a key advantage of participating life insurance because policyowner dividends, once credited, aren’t negatively affected by future experience,” Ms. Frossard says.

A client can use dividends in a variety of ways. For example, there’s the option to take the dividends as cash or buy additional insurance coverage, which may increase the cash value in the policy. Others might opt to use their dividends to reduce or even stop their out-of-pocket premium payments.

“The choice of how to use your dividend is entirely yours. You can choose an option that works best for you and aligns with your goals for the policy,” Ms. Frossard says.

“This product is about providing Canadians with stable policy growth, flexible features and potential tax advantages” she adds. “People know that they can help take care of their loved ones after they’re gone and also have the confidence that they’re financially prepared for life’s unexpected expenses.”

Filling out insurance applications for clients is an unavoidable fact of administrative life for financial security advisors. But what if that often labour-intensive and paperwork-heavy process could all go away?

That’s exactly what a digital application from Canada Life™ offers advisors across the country.

“SimpleProtect is a reimagined view of an insurance application,” says Jeff Adams, product owner of the New Business Onboarding Lab at Canada Life.

Story continues below advertisement

The lab is the insurance provider’s innovation incubator. Mr. Adams spearheaded development of SimpleProtect™ working closely with Canada Life’s network of advisors.

“It wasn’t just a dozen people at Canada Life brainstorming what we think advisors want,” he says. “There were lots of discussions with advisors about what they need.”

SimpleProtect launched in April, 2019. The digital application allows advisors to help their clients apply for term and participating life insurance as well as critical illness insurance in about 15 minutes.

By comparison, paper applications – and even other digital application systems – take about 40 to 45 minutes, says Herv Herceg, navigator of the New Business Onboarding Lab at Canada Life.

“And that’s only if they get the application right,” Mr. Herceg says. “The opportunity to make an error with paper applications is significant, which means the process can often take much longer.”

That’s not the case with SimpleProtect. The digital application has narrowed down the question-and-answer portion of the traditional insurance application from more than 50 questions to just 20 for clients to answer.

“We spent a lot of time determining what questions were needed to ensure we would be comfortable insuring someone, so we didn’t have to ask more later in the process,” Mr. Adams says. “SimpleProtect provides a superior experience to advisors and their clients.”

Story continues below advertisement

Traditional application processes have long been a pain point for advisors and their clients, Mr. Herceg says. His role on the project was ensuring SimpleProtect works seamlessly on the backend, providing fast approval for clients.

“We heard over and over from advisors that they would provide the advice component to their clients, finding them the right insurance product for their needs. But then to wrap it all up, they would have to walk them through this painstaking process that could take upward of an hour,” he says.

More often than not, follow-up would be required, leading to a lot of back-and-forth communication between the insurer, advisor and client. That can make the whole application and approval process take several days, if not weeks.

That’s often an obstacle for advisors. While their clients see value in life and critical illness coverage, they tend to put off applying for insurance in part because of the perception of the lengthy application process. SimpleProtect helps remove that barrier. The digital process sends applications upon completion directly, quickly and securely to Canada Life.

Mr. Adams notes the high adoption rate among the independent advisors with whom Canada Life works. The majority of advisors who can access SimpleProtect now use it.

“In general, the feedback has been incredible,” Mr. Adams says. “What we hear from advisors is the application experience is a significant improvement over the old ways of doing things.”

Mr. Herceg adds that as advisors want to provide advice and help their clients, “the last thing they want to do is deal with a bunch of application paperwork.”

Equally important, clients like the experience too. Advisors are able to tell their clients that the process “will just take a few minutes” – and it really does.

“A lot of advisors, after filling out the application [with SimpleProtect], would often hear surprised clients asking, ‘We’re done, already?’” Mr. Adams says. “These clients are tickled pink that they weren’t stuck in their advisors’ office filling out an application for 40 minutes or more.”

SimpleProtect is currently available for term and participating life insurance coverage up to $2-million and a maximum of $250,000 for critical illness. It’s also offered for individuals who are 60 years of age and under.

But you can expect to see the application expand in its usefulness in the coming months. The development team at Canada Life’s New Business Onboarding Lab are constantly looking for ways to improve SimpleProtect to make advisors’ jobs easier.

“That’s what makes SimpleProtect special,” Mr. Herceg says. “We’re not simply satisfied with what it currently offers advisors. We listen to what they want and plan to build on SimpleProtect to make it even better in the future. It’s not a static, one-and-done tool; it’s an evolving process.”

COVID-19 has given Canadians plenty to fret about this year. Top among those are concerns about their own health and mortality in addition to the well-being of their loved ones. That has led many Canadians to take a closer look at life insurance.

Financial security advisors have been there to help. So too has SimpleProtect™, an innovative digital application from Canada Life™.

“Instead of taking upward of an hour, as it often does for traditional, paper-based applications, applying for coverage with SimpleProtect takes about 15 minutes,” says Jeff Adams, product owner at the New Business Onboarding Lab at Canada Life.

Story continues below advertisement

One reason why Canada Life has been able to slash the time required is because SimpleProtect’s question-and-answer section is much shorter than paper and even other digital applications, he says.

SimpleProtect was a hit for advisors since its launch in 2019, but it has become even more useful during the pandemic, when meeting face-to-face with clients has been more difficult.

Using the online tool, an insurance application can be done virtually, anywhere in Canada. Signatures can be completed using a smartphone and clients can be verified using video chat.

“We have a proprietary process for capturing the client’s signature remotely, securely and conveniently,” Mr. Adams says. “It’s an instant signature that is captured and sent back to Canada Life in real time.”

The fact SimpleProtect makes the entire application process easy for advisors and clients also makes it a useful tool, “but in the middle of a pandemic, it has become essential for many advisors challenged to meet face-to-face with clients,” Mr. Adams says. “That got a whole lot of advisors using SimpleProtect who weren’t before. It really speaks to the idea of it being the right app at the right time.”

Since the pandemic first hit, Canada Life has seen usage of SimpleProtect soar. Among advisors with access to the application, those using it jumped from about half in February to the majority of advisors using it by April.

“Insurance has definitely become a top-of-mind issue for many families as opposed to being previously an issue on the backburner,” says Mr. Adams, who was one of the leads in developing the online application.

As a liaison with advisors across Canada, Mr. Adams ensures that SimpleProtect is exactly what advisors want and, more importantly, need. SimpleProtect has become a go-to application for advisors signing up their clients, age 60 and under, for term and participating life policies up to $2-million. The app also can be used for critical illness coverage up to $250,000.

Herv Herceg, navigator of the New Business Onboarding Lab at Canada Life, says SimpleProtect works hand in glove with the firm’s underwriting processes. That leads to very quick turnaround times for approval of applications.

“Rather than the traditional paper application and approval process, which can take weeks, advisors using SimpleProtect can get their clients approved for insurance in as little as 24 hours – often instantly,” Mr. Herceg says.

Advisors are asking about how they can do more with this digital application, he says. SimpleProtect has been an evolving project at Canada Life, and it remains that way so it can better serve advisors and clients.

One of the latest enhancements, driven by advisors, is the ability to take remote electronic signatures of more than one person on an application. Other changes are pending, too, including expanding the amount of coverage available for plans and increasing the age range for applicants.

SimpleProtect’s current wheelhouse is for term and critical illness policies. The key market includes individuals with growing families to think about.

“People who are typically, ‘I don’t need life insurance, I’m young,’ are the perfect candidates for using SimpleProtect,” Mr. Herceg says. “Advisors can get them term life insurance very, very quickly.”

Turn upgrading your home into an artisanal experience with a visit to this Vancouver furniture workshop

Bespoke Vancouver furniture studio Union Wood Co. is an ideal destination for anyone looking for a unique new custom bed, table or desk.

Brought to you by Long-haul travel might not be on the table for Canadians yet, but fortunately there’s still plenty to discover in our own backyards. Brought to you by Lexus, this series highlights experiences in your backyard and beyond to be found behind the wheel of a Lexus SUV. For this year's best trips, getting there is half the fun.

Now that we’re spending more time at home, it’s never been more important to surround ourselves with things that we love. The emergence of a “new normal” also offers a meaningful opportunity to embrace more sustainable shopping habits, by shifting attention back to handcrafted, high-quality designs that are built to last. The Lexus UX 250h AWD, with its Self-Charging Hybrid-Electric technology and luxurious interior details shaped by master Takumi artisans, is a perfect example. As a stylish urban crossover that minimizes impact on the environment, it’s a ride you can love in every sense. The question then becomes, how to carry this future-minded philosophy into your domestic space, too? Bespoke Vancouver furniture studio Union Wood Co. is a perfect starting point for anyone with a bed- or dining table-sized void to fill.

The Lexus UX 250h AWD, a self-charging hybrid-electric crossover with interior details crafted by Takumi artisans, will get you to your destination in comfort and style.

The workshop rose to fame for crafting raw, utilitarian designs like live-edge dining tables and metal nightstands that harken back to Vancouver’s industrial past. Lately, however, they’ve expanded into modern creations like a clean-lined platform bed fitted with a hydraulic lift system for easy access to a large under-bed storage compartment. It’s a piece well-suited to the city’s forest of compact condos, as are Union Wood Co.‘s custom wall units featuring sliding barn doors to conceal a flat screen TV.

Uniting this diverse portfolio is each design’s shared focus on honouring the high quality of its materials. Union Wood Co. creative director Craig Pearce and his supplier team proudly source only kiln-dried premium lumber from sustainably harvested forests. In the process, they take care to set aside planks with unique grain patterns for special projects that will make the most of the wood’s natural beauty and character. And once a piece is complete, all wood is finished with natural yet hard-wearing vegetable oils and waxes that ensure its beauty lasts a lifetime. Much like the Lexus UX 250h AWD’s electric motor, these are tables developed with future generations in mind.

Another defining characteristic of the studio is its sky’s-the-limit attitude towards custom requests. Clients with a clear idea in mind can describe their dream piece and watch it take shape through sketches and wood samples, while those who prefer browsing a catalogue of existing designs can still opt to tweak an item’s dimensions for a bespoke fit. Either way, every commission leads to furniture distinctly suited to the style and specifications of its owner.

To give shoppers an authentic sense of exactly what’s involved in realizing their vision, this early consultation stage plays out in a small showroom built right next door to the gentle hum of milling and assembly equipment in Union Wood Co.‘s workshop. Located in East Vancouver’s Clark Drive Industrial District, this store-slash-studio setup repurposes an industrial building that once served as a wool mill.

Located just off the beaten path, it represents exactly the sort of urban excursion that a nimble, compact crossover like the UX 250h AWD is made for. Shoppers who arrive for a weekday appointment will get a firsthand look at the expert joinery that defines Union Wood Co.‘s woodwork, whose precision and balance calls to mind the work of Lexus’s Takumi craftspeople on the UX 250h AWD’s interior, like the Washi dashboard trim that mimics a traditional Japanese door.

Just a few months ago, housing markets from coast-to-coast slowed to a near-standstill as COVID-19 cast a pall of uncertainty over Canada’s economy. Buyers and sellers sat on the sidelines, waiting to see what the future would bring.

However, since late spring, home sales have rebounded due to pent-up demand and record-low interest rates that have spurred buyers to get serious about house hunting.

“It’s been somewhat surprising, in the middle of a pandemic, to see the continued strength of housing markets,” says Andy Charles, chief executive officer of mortgage insurance provider Canada Guaranty Mortgage Insurance Company.

Story continues below advertisement

There are still some soft spots across the country, Mr. Charles says, “but generally, it’s been much more robust than many of us anticipated.”

It’s a tough call for first-time buyers: Low-interest rates make it attractive to nail down a mortgage, but a competitive market means fewer deals.

Here are some expert tips on what first-time buyers should keep in mind:

1. How much of a mortgage can I afford?

So, you’ve decided it’s time to buy a house or condo. Before you do anything, run the numbers to see how much of a mortgage you can comfortably carry. And be hard on yourself — lenders certainly will.

“Start with your household income,” says Jamie Golombek, managing director of tax and estate planning at CIBC Private Wealth Management.

“Don’t include overtime, or bonuses, or anything but your base salary,” he adds, noting that lenders generally don’t include those types of additional income in their calculations since they can fluctuate yearly.

If you’re self-employed, Mr. Golombek recommends keeping a record of past notices of assessment from the Canada Revenue Agency to prove a steady income.

When making a homeowner budget, don’t forget to include legal and closing costs, as well as ongoing expenses such as insurance, utilities, condo fees (if applicable) and repair and maintenance fees. Once you have a rough sense of what you can afford monthly, use an online mortgage calculator to figure out your price ceiling.

You should also talk to a mortgage advisor, who can help you figure out the best options for your situation and find the best mortgage rate.

2. How is your credit rating?

“It’s extremely important for first-timers to address potential credit issues,” Mr. Charles says. “So do your homework and ensure your credit profile is strong.”

Canada’s two major credit-rating agencies, Equifax and TransUnion, offer online platforms to help you find your current score. If it’s on the low side, lenders may be less likely to offer competitive rates; or your mortgage application could be denied. A low credit score will also make it tougher to secure a pre-approval, which is valuable in a competitive housing market (as we’ll see below).

But don’t despair — there’s plenty you can do in relatively short order to boost your score. A dedicated mortgage advisor will help you organize your finances and highlight the quickest and most-effective ways to boost your rating.

According to Mr. Charles, it can be as simple as being more diligent about paying monthly bills on time and not carrying a credit card balance. If you’re aiming to take on mortgage debts soon, prioritize paying down high-interest loans and credit cards first.

Also, keep an eye out for errors when you peruse your credit report. They can happen, and you can notify the credit bureau to correct them.

3. Why getting a mortgage pre-approval is a good idea

Strengthening your credit rating not only gives you a better shot at a great rate but also a higher chance of being pre-approved for a mortgage — a must-have when vying for a home in a hot market. Many realtors and financial advisers, including those at CIBC, suggest a pre-approval should be the first step when house hunting, even before hitting the open houses, virtually or in person.

“An offer conditional on financing will be ignored right away in favour of an offer from someone pre-approved,” Mr. Golombek says. “CIBC is definitely encouraging people to pre-approve. We have an online pre-approval application and, with that, you walk in confidently with an offer, knowing you’re ready to go.”

A CIBC mobile mortgage advisor can provide you with a mortgage pre-approval certificate to help you shop with confidence. A pre-approval certificate is based on your verified financial information and establishes the mortgage amount you qualify for. It also guarantees your interest rate for up to 120 days from the date of the certificate.

Plus, a pre-approval certificate allows you to signal to sellers that you are a serious and qualified buyer and you’ll be prepared to walk in confidently with an offer when you see the home of your dreams. It also provides you with some negotiation leverage, especially during a bidding war.

4. Should I go with a fixed or variable mortgage?

“It’s a classic question,” Mr. Golombek says, to which there used to be a definitive answer.

He says studies from the 1990s and 2000s show variable rates were the way to go “because it would result in a lower rate over time.”

However, in today’s ultra-low rate environment, the predictability of a fixed rate can be appealing for homeowners who want a reliable budget. In fact, with rates as low as they are today, Mr. Golombek says a fixed-rate mortgage may end up being insurance against higher rates in years to come.

Story continues below advertisement

CIBC offers both variable- and fixed-rate mortgages at competitive rates. There are also other types of mortgages with more flexibility for prepayments as well as convertible mortgages that can convert from open to closed at any time. An advisor can walk through each option in detail.

5. Types of mortgage insurance to consider

There are two considerations here: mortgage insurance and mortgage default insurance.

Mortgage insurance can protect your mortgage and ensure you and your family can stay in your home if you are unable to work due to a disability, involuntary job loss, critical illness, or in the event of your death. At CIBC, customers can choose the type of insurance that meets their needs and provides peace of mind.

Mortgage default insurance is required by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC ) if you make a down payment on your home of less than 20 per cent. There are three Canadian insurers to choose from: CMHC, Genworth Financial and Canada Guaranty.

In July, CMHC tightened the eligibility rules. Borrowers are now limited to spending 35 per cent of their gross income on housing, as opposed to the old 39 per cent; the minimum credit score needed is 680, up from 600; and down payments can no longer come from “non-traditional” sources, such as unsecured loans or credit cards.

Story continues below advertisement

Canada Guaranty and Genworth, however, haven’t adopted similar changes. “We’re very comfortable with the risk profile of borrowers and properties we’re insuring,” Mr. Charles says. “Canada Guaranty does make dynamic underwriting policy changes as market dynamics evolve.”

Work with professionals

Home buyers in general, but first-timers in particular, should seek out advisors — from real estate agents to banking and mortgage specialists — to ensure they’re making the right moves to meet their unique ownership needs.

Much of the home buying process is happening virtually today “and navigating some of this new environment goes back to using the right professionals,” says Christopher Alexander, executive vice-president and regional director at Re/Max Integra Ontario-Atlantic Canada.

As housing costs climb, some buyers may be tempted to cut costs by skipping professional help, which Mr. Alexander discourages.

“This is the biggest and among the most complicated transactions most people ever make,” he says. “Make sure you’ve got professionals on your side.”

Mr. Golombek says CIBC mortgage advisors are taking extra steps during the pandemic to work with clients remotely. From the first consultations to pre-approval and right up to closing, the entire process can be done remotely and online to ensure buyers stay healthy and safe during the house-hunting process.

Data centres have become critical for business continuity in today’s digital economy. Now, with the decentralization of the workforce brought on by a shift to many employees working from home, organizations are relying on their network infrastructure to keep businesses running and keep services for consumers seamless.

This trend towards a distributed workforce will not be short-lived. Many businesses like Twitter, Facebook, Google and Shopify have already announced plans to leave a traditional office behind long term or permanently. With these changes, systems need to be reliable and resilient against user and power fluctuations, and they must be properly equipped to handle this new work style.

Data centres provide organizations with essential services such as collecting, storing, processing, distributing and providing access to large volumes of information that, in turn, enable companies to run and individuals to experience the world as we know it. Everything from streaming television shows to financial services to personal photo storage relies on data centres.

While they are a critical part of our everyday lives at home and work, data centres are also energy intensive, using billions of kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. These facilities are often housed in buildings, or groups of buildings, complete with computers, telecommunications equipment and storage systems, backup components and power supply infrastructure, as well as air conditioning and various security devices—all of which have energy needs.

“They are using vast amounts of electricity,” says Wei Shi, an associate professor at Carleton University’s School of Information Technology. “They generate a lot of heat and need to be cooled down.”

The International Energy Agency (IEA) notes that demand for data centres and data transmission network services will continue to grow strongly over the next decade, especially as our world becomes increasingly connected and digital.

“Innovation will be critical to ensuring that energy efficiency gains continue to keep overall energy demand in check,” the IEA said in a recent report. It also noted that demand for data centre services is being offset by “continued improvements in the efficiency of servers, storage devices, network switches and data centre infrastructure, as well as a shift to much greater shares of cloud and hyperscale data centres.”

The demand for data centre services, together with the growing importance of mitigating environmental impact, presents an opportunity to maximize efficiencies. To that end, data centres around the world are partnering with organizations that can help them become more energy efficient and reduce their operating costs.

“The reliance on cloud and data centre services has been growing exponentially for years,” says David O’Reilly, vice-president and general manager of Schneider Electric’s secure power division. “That growth has also encouraged incredible competition and customers are realizing that taking an environmentally friendly approach gives them a sharp competitive advantage.”

Mr. O’Reilly also notes that it’s not enough to just focus on the straightforward challenges of managing a business. “We must address the hard problems of sustainability head on. That’s where the greatest gains for organizations can be made and that’s where we can help,” he says.

Schneider Electric focuses on helping businesses in this space solve challenges by deploying a mix of tailored solutions. For example, its EcoStruxure platform can help new and existing data centres with the ability to find efficiencies where they are needed most and find opportunities to optimize energy usage. Sensors and alarm systems can alert data centre managers to issues before a system goes down. And edge energy storage technologies, which enable computing to be done at or near the source of the data instead of the cloud, can extend critical power performance.

DigiPlex, a leading data centre in Norway, chose a suite of Schneider Electric solutions to deliver efficiency, flexibility and performance, which has resulted in an overall reduction in energy consumption and increased reliability for its customers.

The firm believes that being more sustainable will help it better compete with other data centres. “Ten years from now, if you don’t operate a completely renewable, sustainable data centre, you will not be here,” Pål Rune Viken, operations manager for DigiPlex Norway says.

“Ultimately, we are arming businesses with the ability to make smarter, more sustainable decisions to use their facility better,” says Mr. O’Reilly. “Understanding what the energy use is, what the cooling capacity is, where they have stranded power, what pieces are underutilized – all that information is now at their fingertips.”

Harleen Puaar Shukla remembers the moment Sault Ste. Marie first felt like home. She’d recently arrived from New Delhi, where she grew up, to study public relations and events management at Sault College. A friend of a friend invited Shukla to a dinner party with other members of the city’s Indian community. “I did not know that there was a [sizeable] Indian population here,” she says. “So that, I think, was the moment where I felt okay.”

Still, Shukla wondered if she’d have an easier time building her career in a bigger city. She ended up moving to Toronto—but after a couple of months, she realized that it wasn’t where she wanted to be.

“It was so different living in Sault Ste. Marie, because I wasn't used to [the pace],” she says. “When I was in Toronto, I felt like I was back in New Delhi. It's the same lifestyle. And I think that's why I made that choice to come back to the Soo.”

As a vibrant community of 73,000, Sault Ste. Marie has all the amenities of a larger Canadian city, with the safety of a smaller one. Locals have always recognized the city’s adventurous charms, including world-class fly fishing, kilometres of cross-country ski trails and easy access to canoe tripping—but now a growing number of adventure enthusiasts and even less outdoorsy city folk are relocating to Northern Ontario.

With real estate prices rising in cities like Toronto and its surrounding suburbs, Sault Ste. Marie has become an attractive option—it’s affordable, welcoming and laid-back. What’s more, home ownership is achievable in the northern city; the Canadian Real Estate Association reported that the average cost of a home in the Sault in March 2019 was $184,810. And these transplants are sticking around. According to a 2019 report¹ from Public Policy Forum and Pathways to Prosperity, 73.4 per cent of the immigrants who arrived in the city between 2007 and 2011 were still living there five years later.

Shukla isn’t the only millennial putting down roots in Sault Ste. Marie. Dr. Jenna Rebelo moved to Sault Ste. Marie from Hamilton, Ont. in Jan. 2019 with her husband, Mike, and their one-year-old son, Felix. The couple had been living in their hometown while she finished her last year of residency for medical school at McMaster University. One day while on mat leave, she got a text message about a job opportunity in the Soo.

“My initial thought was, I’ve never been to Northern Ontario ever. I am not outdoorsy. So, you know, sure, I’ll look into it, but I didn’t think too much of it,” she says.

That is, until she spent two weeks visiting Sault Area Hospital. “The longer I was there, the more I got this sense that I needed to come back,” says Rebelo, an ears nose and throat specialist. “I felt like, I can't imagine that I'm not going to see these people again. I already feel like I belong here.”

That feeling didn’t go away when they actually moved to the Soo. In fact, Mike says the community made his own transition much easier. “It's a bit of a leap of faith, [ moving to a ] place that you don't know anybody,” he says. But people went out of their way to make him feel welcome, including the car salesman who sold the couple a second vehicle—and invited Mike to join his softball team.

Rebelo also knew moving to the Sault would be the right move for her career. It can be difficult to attract doctors to the North, but she knew working in a smaller city meant she’d get a chance to do more, sooner. “The neat thing about practising here is that you really can explore the full depth of practice and not just the breadth,” she says. “People are so happy when I tell them that they don't have to go down south for their ear surgeries—I can do it right here.”

Like Rebelo, Teni Araba, director of human resources at Algoma University, says she also fell for the city before she even knew she’d be living here. At first, it was about the Soo’s natural beauty—and abundant space. “It is serene, it is naturally beautiful, picturesque. I always say you can’t take a bad picture in the Soo; it just can’t happen,” she says. And when she realized that you can get anywhere in the Soo in 15 minutes or less, she was thrilled to spend less time commuting than she used to in Regina, Sask.

But it took actually moving to the Soo with her husband Gabriel and their three kids—14-year-old Romi, six-year-old Jola and four-year-old Fami—to understand how great the city is for young families. “[We have] the opportunity to raise our kids in a friendly, welcoming place,” she says. It’s not just about access to the outdoors; the family attends the United Baptist Church, and take lessons at the Algoma Conservatory of Music.

They all stress how warm and welcoming the city is. For Shukla, who met her now-husband at that first dinner party and has now lived in the Soo for almost six years, there’s no place she’d rather be. “It's an ideal place because you get the real Canadian experience here. And you're not spending hours on commuting. Instead, you're spending time with family. I think it’s a great place to put down roots.”

Ottawa is an active city that takes four-seasons outdoor fun as seriously as its love for lively local arts and culture, excellent restaurants and craft brewing.

Ottawa resident Andrew Szeto is passionate about Ottawa’s sports and recreation scene. It’s just so easy for locals and visitors to be active in the city, he says. In summer, he can often be found canoeing on the waters around Ottawa, using one of the stunning hand-crafted paddles he makes.

While visitors from other cities may have to endure long drives to reach hiking trails and dedicated cycling paths back home, so many things that truly elevate an active getaway can be done either right in walkable Ottawa, or within a short drive.

“I’d say certainly the beautiful thing about our city is within 20 minutes you can be in great wilderness in Gatineau Park. And the fall, with the leaves, it’s pretty incredible,” says Szeto, who has called Ottawa home for 10 years."

At 42 years old, it was her first full-term pregnancy after experiencing two preterm births – of which neither child survived.

Kone, who lives in a rural village in the southern region of Mali, says Born on Time’s program, implemented by Save the Children in Mali, was essential to keeping her informed about her reproductive health, supporting her throughout her pregnancy and helping her deliver her son safely.

“Thanks to the assistance of the program, I was more confident knowing that I had support. I am happy that this baby is safe,” Kone says.

Poor access to health care and low rates of female autonomy are among the many roadblocks that women in Mali face when pregnant. About 12 per cent of babies are born prematurely in the West African country – most of whom have a low chance of survival, as 30 per cent of neonatal deaths are due to prematurity.

Born on Time is tackling this issue through a holistic, community-based approach. The initiative aims to improve the quality of reproductive health services throughout the Sikasso Region in Southern Mali, and equip couples like Kone and her husband with the tools they need to support a healthy pregnancy.

Until a few years ago, the words ‘mining’ and ‘sustainability’ were rarely used in the same sentence. The public perception of the industry, in general, appeared to be focused more on the volume of commodities produced than on protecting the environment and communities that surround its operations.

Times have changed. Today’s mining companies are deeply concerned and committed to sustainability. At the same time, new technology is using more periodic table elements than ever before, all of which need to be mined or extracted.

Many producers are focused on helping to fight climate change — not just because it’s the right thing to do, can reduce risk and save money — but many of the metals produced are essential in the global transition to a low-carbon economy.

Sustainable products like electric cars and solar panels rely on a combination of materials such as copper, lithium, silver, zinc, titanium and rare earth elements, but the extraction and production of these materials also play a critical role.

For David Willick, vice-president and mining, minerals and metals segment leader for North America at Schneider Electric, the conversation for the mining industry is two-fold: embracing sustainability at the source of the resource and across the entire production chain.

This approach helps to ensure the longevity of the industry, which is critical considering that mining represents about five per cent of Canada’s GDP and accounts for one in every 30 jobs in the country, according to the Mining Association of Canada.

“There has been a paradigm shift” in how miners operate, says Roussos Dimitrakopoulos, a professor and the Canada research chair in sustainable mineral resource development at McGill University. He says companies want to boost their extraction of raw materials in a sustainable way.

Beyond increasing production, mining companies are investing more in different technologies that reduce their environmental impact and give visibility into operations to make sustainable choices.

“Digital transformation yields many benefits that deliver on energy and operational efficiency, sustainability and safety — and this is where Schneider Electric has been able to help businesses make meaningful strides,” Mr. Willick says.

Schneider Electric Canada helps mid- to large-size firms track their energy consumption by installing sensors that can indicate high-usage times and areas, enabling them to pinpoint where they can cut electricity costs, manage their sources of energy and track and report carbon-reduction measures.

“Some mining processes are very energy-intensive,” says Tara Rana, global solutions architect focused on mining, materials and metals with Schneider Electric. He says that once these areas are identified, Schneider can install ‘variable frequency drives,’ enabling the motors to run at different speeds and allowing the power usage to be more nuanced. Mr. Willick says firms can lower their energy consumption by 50 per cent with these drives in specific applications.

In addition, microgrids have become one of the main solutions that Schneider Electric deploys in mining environments to help drive energy-efficient outcomes. They are used as power backup in emergencies or aid the power distribution grid during periods of heavy demand. By using microgrids, different sources of energy can be bundled — whether it is electric or solar — and released strategically as needed.

“It allows real-time, automatic management of the most optimal energy source at any given time.” Mr. Willick says. “That level of control is essential for using energy efficiently.”

Australian miner Roy Hill partnered with Schneider Electric to create an integrated operating model that provides end-to-end visibility of its value chain. Roy Hill’s remote operations centre, located in Perth, about 1,300 km from the mine, tracks all mine operations in real-time and provides energy and sustainability data in one single, global view.

With the current global focus on sustainability, combined with the need to be more competitive, the biggest mining firms are moving in the right direction, Mr. Willick says.

An example is global mining giant Rio Tinto plc, which has committed to “substantial decarbonization” of its business by 2050. The company says more than 70 per cent of its electricity comes from renewable sources. Similarly, Elysis, a joint venture between Rio Tinto and Alcoa, is working on a project to produce zero-carbon aluminum in Quebec.

In Canada, Vancouver-based Teck Resources Ltd. has also announced plans to become carbon neutral by 2050. Since 2011, Teck said it has put in place projects and initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at its operations by 289,000 tonnes, or the equivalent to taking over 88,000 combustion engine cars off the road.

“We’re seeing significant interest in becoming more sustainable within the operations and practices of mining companies,” Mr. Willick says. “It’s fantastic that there’s more awareness, but we need to continue to push ourselves and demand more sustainable options to have a meaningful impact on our planet’s future.”

The global economic challenges we face are a stark reminder of how interdependent and vulnerable our society is to global threats and reinforce the need for a more resilient and sustainable approach to how we live.

The notion of ‘flattening the curve’ with coronavirus has taught us a valuable lesson when faced with a serious risk: act now or face dire consequences. It’s a similar warning with climate change — a seemingly slower-moving problem compared to COVID-19, but just as urgent for preserving society’s future on this planet.

“As we transition into what comes next, now is the time to apply the ‘flatten the curve’ principle to the fight against climate change,” says Susan Uthayakumar, president of Schneider Electric Canada, a global leader in energy management and industrial automation, which plays a central role in powering our homes, cities and industries.

“The health crisis has taught us that global cooperation is needed to tackle global challenges,” Ms. Uthayakumar says. “The climate battle cannot be won alone. We need to work together to flatten the curve; for climate change.”

The good news, Ms. Uthayakumar says, is that solutions are available now to accelerate progress.

“We urgently need to accelerate and scale up,” she says. “As governments look for ways to rebuild the economy and work towards a resilient and sustainable future, now is the time to commit to a clean energy transition.”

Infrastructure improvements will be crucial as we prepare for the new normal, Ms. Uthayakumar says, including an all-electric transition to renewable energy and an all-digital approach to build scale and bring efficiencies.

“We need to learn from the current crisis and turn it into a chance to create a better future,” she says.

A chance to build a prosperous future

For decades, society has been living as though the planet can provide endless resources and absorb infinite quantities of waste or emissions, with little consideration given to the long-term impacts. Overconsumption and over-pollution have disrupted the delicate balance between the Earth’s ecological supply and demand, triggering global warming, extreme weather events, biodiversity losses at an unprecedented pace, ecosystems destruction and massive social inequality around the world.

In more recent decades, there has been a steady shift among both consumers and business attitudes towards recognizing humanity’s role in climate change, which has paved the way for new thinking on how to sustain the Earth’s resources, protect biodiversity and limit carbon emissions, while preserving our global economy’s vibrancy and growth prospects.

This concept where both people and the planet can live in harmony is sometimes defined as ‘one-planet prosperity.’

To bring greater awareness to the Earth’s ecological deficit and the strength of one-planet prosperity strategies, California-based non-profit Global Footprint Network and Schneider Electric have partnered to measure Earth Overshoot Day – the theoretical date in the year when the strains placed on the planet by human beings, such as carbon emissions, resource extraction or deforestation, to name a few, exceed the planet’s ability to replenish itself naturally and sustainably. In 2020, that day is Aug. 22, but through the adoption of resource efficiency and digital energy management systems, including those provided by Schneider Electric, it’s possible to push this date back.

“I truly believe that if everyone knew this, they would decide to act instead of borrowing from the future,” Ms. Uthayakumar says. “One-planet prosperity thinking has to become central to achieving a truly sustainable future where we can all identify opportunities to drive efficiencies and reduce our ecological footprint.”

According to Xavier Houot, Schneider Electric’s chief environment officer, that means reducing the ecological footprint of both production and consumption practices “in a deliberate, positive and forward-looking manner. One-planet prosperity means significantly shrinking resource intensity in ways that also allow economies to prosper and jobs to be created.”

Actioning ‘one-planet prosperity’ models around the world

Embracing this need for one planet prosperity, organizations worldwide have started to deploy the right mix of energy management, industrial automation and renewable electricity solutions. Many have turned to Schneider Electric for help.

For example, in Canada, Schneider Electric has worked with the Port of Montreal to modernize Alexandra Pier, designing a ship-to-shore power solution that reduces emissions from ships by letting them power down engines while in port. The vessels are plugged into the city’s electric power grid with a Schneider-designed ShoreBoX. The collective initiative allowed the Port of Montreal to articulate its focus on sustainability through this project and demonstrated its commitment to contributing positively to the community.

In the U.S., Chicago’s Shedd Aquarium worked with Schneider Electric to devise a new building- and power-management system, touching on everything from lighting to life support for its 1,500 species of animals. The facility ultimately cut water and energy use in half.

In Finland, the organization has worked with grocery chain Lidl to build the country’s largest microgrid — including a solar array, energy storage and a microgrid advisor system — in a distribution centre. Schneider Electric’s Internet of Things-enabled platform, EcoStruxure, gathers real-time data to teach the building to optimize its energy consumption, maximizing renewables and reducing overall use. It has so far led to energy-cost savings of more than 70 per cent.

Efforts like these are becoming increasingly critical for both business performance and long-term ‘licence to operate’ with stakeholders, Mr. Houot says. Internationally, governments and consumers are raising their expectations of companies to operate sustainably and, as significant contributors to carbon emissions around the world, industry, building, transportation, and agriculture sectors have a major responsibility to act now.

The message is getting through that real sustainability is much more than mere corporate responsibility messaging, but a critical success factor in any business model. Now that we have experienced how global crises can impact us all, we need to collectively consider metrics such as Earth Overshoot Day to gauge our global economy through its commitment to one-planet compatibility. Action taken today will protect ourselves from the challenges we know are on the horizon.

Among the lessons learned in recent months is the fragility of our economic systems and the need to build more resilience for the future. The impact of one global event can be far-reaching and climate change is no different. It’s a global event with widespread consequences. Individuals, businesses and governments need to consider new methods and models that put us on a path towards environmental stability.

The world produces more than 2.01 billion tonnes of waste each year and, without urgent action, that number is expected to increase to 3.4 billion by 2050 driven by growing populations and growing urbanization, according to the World Bank.

It also warns that mismanagement of waste is a threat to human health and the environment, while urging the development of strategies to manage waste to create sustainable communities over the long term. Central to this need is the concept of a circular economy, where products are designed and optimized for reuse and recycling.

Rather than extracting new raw materials to manufacture products, which ultimately wind up in the landfill, circular economy principles strive to create zero waste. It’s no longer just ‘reduce, reuse, recycle.’ To minimize environmental impact and promote economic growth, many people and organizations are adding a few more ‘Rs’ to the equation, including repair, refurbish, remanufacture and return to the earth through composting.

“Ensuring we can produce recyclable products is no longer sufficient,” says Susan Uthayakumar, president of Schneider Electric Canada, which provides energy management and automation solutions to help organizations reduce energy consumption, while increasing productivity and efficiency.

Participating in the circular economy makes both environmental and economic sense, Ms. Uthayakumar says. “Embracing this way of thinking goes hand in hand with using data to drive intelligent decision making, which helps you use less resources. The result is efficiency, leading to higher profitability,” she says.

Schneider Electric has helped many businesses incorporate circular economic principles into their operations, including the City of Toronto, which uses the company’s Avantis Enterprise Asset Management solution for its water and wastewater infrastructure to lower repair and replacement costs. They have also worked with Port of Montreal to provide docked ships with access to hydroelectricity, instead of relying on diesel.

All these solutions incorporate Internet-of-Things (IoT) connected components that provide real-time data to ensure continually improving energy efficiency, all under a platform called Schneider Electric EcoStruxure. The core of this technology connects operational and IT technology to unlock trapped value in operations and enable predictive analytics to make smarter decisions. It provides alerts for maintenance and replacement before components fail, which extends the life of existing infrastructure, while eliminating unexpected repairs that can result in costly operational downtime.

And in a circular economy, when equipment must be replaced, old parts don’t end up in the landfill.

Schneider Electric’s Green Premium products, services and solutions provide transparent information on materials, environmental impact and end-of-life instructions. For instance, Green Premium solutions use IoT-enabled tools to help companies efficiently use energy and other natural resources to reduce their environmental impact and minimize their carbon footprint. Additionally, all product components can be reused, refurbished, recycled or decompose when landfilled.

“It is about effectively retaining ownership of products through their life, so manufacturers are really selling the utility of products, not the products themselves,” says Usman Valiante, a senior policy analyst and circular economy consultant with Cardwell Grove Inc. in B.C.

“Once a device reaches its end of life, for example, it goes back to the manufacturer to be refurbished, remanufactured, or broken down into base components, and recycled back into the next generation of products.”

Closing the loop on end-of-life product waste represents a potentially significant change, given estimates in a 2017 Deloitte study that only nine per cent of the 3.2 million tonnes of plastic waste generated annually in Canada is recycled.

“The circular economy is critical … not just for the long-term sustainability of our company and our clients, but for the planet,” Ms. Uthayakumar says. “It’s why we pay so much attention to the lifecycle of our products and the raw materials to manufacture them. They help our customers move with us toward a sustainable world.”

Many businesses reacted quickly in the wake of the global health crisis to create work-from-home policies, stricter health and safety protocols and preserve cash. But while businesses grapple with significant uncertainty brought on by the pandemic, one fact remains true: businesses must put employees first.

Businesses have a chance to double down on commitments to their people through programming that allows for opportunity, inclusion and development. These initiatives go a long way with employees and even further to create an overall culture where everyone benefits.

Schneider Electric, a global leader in energy management and automation with a strong presence in Canada, is committed to creating and maintaining a company of the future through its Employee Value Proposition, which is a promise to provide an inclusive, empowering and meaningful work environment. It’s dedicated to keeping this culture alive, especially as the way we work changes rapidly.

“It’s our commitment to current and future employees; the reason why people join, stay and remain engaged,” says Thierry Miras, Schneider Electric Canada’s vice-president of human resources.

The company’s purpose is reinforced through internal and external programs that invest in research and development, attract talent and develop innovative solutions.

An example is its global ‘Go Green in the City’ competition, which brings students from more than 3,000 universities and some 160 countries, including Canada, to work together on “bold ideas.”

Kanika Kapila, a recent chemical engineering graduate at the University of Calgary, became a 2018 Go Green global finalist and is now part of the company’s rotational Commercial Leadership Program, which is designed to give new engineering graduates three years of training and experience in three fields of business before selecting an area to focus on and build a career.

Schneider Electric also has partnerships with universities across Canada to support women in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and other significant education programs like the Schneider Electric Smart Grid Laboratory at Ryerson University in Toronto.

The state-of-the-art facility enables researchers, utility engineers, organizations and students to work cooperatively to develop, test and demonstrate ideas and products in fields such as renewables, smart grids and energy storage.

“It’s a very flexible and powerful space to work together,” says Bala Venkatesh, founding academic director and head of the Centre for Urban Energy at Ryerson University. He describes it as a “dream come true” for students to develop meaningful solutions “that make sense for society at large” and “where there’s a pressing need.”

Schneider Electric is also continuously evolving its inclusive practices, policies and behaviours to ensure that it addresses the needs of various groups, including a mix of genders, generations, abilities and backgrounds as well as LGBTQ employees. This approach gives Schneider Electric Canada a competitive advantage and has helped it earn recognition as a top employer for everything from employee training to its green initiatives.

Despite the work done to date, Mr. Miras acknowledges the company is always looking to do more, especially as the workplace environment evolves amid the pandemic.

“In March, we were immediately focused on the health, safety and well-being of our people,” Mr. Miras says. “This included strict safety measures to protect employees, work-from-home policy, virtual learning sessions and live talks, enhancement of our existing benefits standards such as paid care leave, self-quarantine paid leave and virtual care assistance, to name a few.”

As the company prepares to transition into a “new normal,” one that may include more remote working, Mr. Miras says it’s thinking critically about how to maintain a strong culture that is felt by everyone – from employees to customers.

“Digital solutions have always been a part of our organization and our solutions but they’ve been especially helpful in reinforcing our culture, keeping people motivated in their work, and creating better and more tailored experiences for our customers,” he says.

No matter what the future holds, Schneider Electric is steadfast in their commitment to people — and that direction has helped bring stability in times of uncertainty. “We practice and provide sustainability,” Mr. Miras says. “We really want — as a company and as people — to be involved in making the world better.”

Marine ports are of vital economic importance to Canada. Not only are ports the primary access point in the chain of infrastructure, connecting Canada to the rest of the world, but they’re also the backbone of the country’s supply chain, trade routes, drive economic growth and create jobs from coast-to-coast.

“The continuity of infrastructure is critical,” says Bill Jackson, marine sector leader at Schneider Electric. But Mr. Jackson says maintaining port infrastructure isn’t just about ensuring the operations are run effectively and efficiently; it’s also taking into consideration their environmental footprint.

The complex infrastructure required to transport products and passengers across the country and around the world has historically come with a heavy environmental footprint. Global marine transportation accounts for an estimated four per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions. With shipping volumes expected to grow in the coming years, more companies and consumers are demanding their goods be transported sustainably.

New technologies are driving change at Canada’s ports, including energy management projects that bring both environmental and economic benefits.

The Port of Montreal is just one example of a Canadian port using sustainability to chart its vision for the future. Located inland, and with its connection to Canada’s rail and road system, the Port of Montreal can serve 40 million consumers in one day by truck and 70 million consumers in less than two days by train. It also connects the Canadian and U.S. supply chain and enables trade across Canada and throughout the world.

“The Port of Montreal cares about its community and its stakeholders,” Mr. Jackson says. “It has recognized that investing in sustainability is the right thing to do for our future generations.”

When cruise ships dock at the Port of Montreal each summer and other vessels over winter, they plug into a new shore power system that improves safety and enables sustainable marine operations. It means vessels can completely shut down their engines but still run their on-board systems — such as lighting, temperature control and communications through the energy provided at shore. The result is a reduction in pollution and emissions as well as noise for the people and animals that call the Port of Montreal area home.

Developed by Schneider Electric Canada, the system is part of a trend toward finding more efficient ways to provide large-scale green energy where and when it’s needed.

“We are helping ships and ports get off of diesel and onto clean electricity,” Mr. Jackson says. “It’s about reducing pollution; it’s about reducing greenhouse gas emissions; and, it’s about improving the health of port communities.”

Mr. Jackson, an electrical engineer, says Schneider Electric has a long history in the marine sector, providing shore power to the equipment aboard ships. The company was involved in developing standards for shore power solutions over a decade ago in California, where shore power is a regulatory requirement today. Schneider Electric has conducted some 50 deployments of the technology around that state and shore power is growing around the world.

But the continued adoption of sustainable solutions like shore power requires government support and the commitment of facilities like the Port of Montreal, which Mr. Jackson says, “has a phenomenal sustainability vision.”

Schneider Electric’s work at the Port of Montreal includes bringing power from Quebec Hydro into a substation that converts it to the right level for ships. It also set up the technology and infrastructure for the Port of Montreal to manage its energy and solutions long term and enable vessels to safely connect.

“The benefit for the ships that dock with us is very straightforward: it’s financial,” says Daniel Dagenais, vice-president of operations at the Port of Montreal, noting that shipping companies and terminals are also concerned about the environment. “If we can actually join environmental benefits to financial benefits — it’s just a great solution.”

Schneider Electric’s technology made sense and the port liked the support that the company provided, Mr. Dagenais says. As well as buying a product and a service, it got a partner as part of the deal.

“Schneider brought credibility to the project,” Mr. Dagenais says.

He says Schneider Electric's shore power solution helped the port reduce 2,800 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) annually. It has received a prestigious environmental award from the Quebec Transportation Association, which is given to projects in the province that reduce the environmental impact of transportation.

It’s this type of recognition that enables the Port of Montreal to “strengthen its positioning as a sustainable port and a leader in green marine initiatives,” Mr. Jackson says.

There’s an echo of this trend across the country. The Port of Vancouver recently installed shore power for its container ships with the support of Schneider Electric, estimating the project will play a massive role in reducing total greenhouse gas emissions at the site.

New ships are being built to run on-shore power, while existing vessels are being retrofitted to connect, Mr. Jackson says. The early focus has been on cruise and container ships, and he expects shore power to soon come to “bulkers” carrying goods like grain, as well as tankers.

As the rest of the marine industry works towards implementing the available solutions that embrace sustainability, the Port of Montreal continues to find ways to improve its sustainability goals and contribute positively to the health of their community. “It’s a lesson all industries can and should learn from,” Mr. Jackson says.

Moreover, focusing on short-term risks alone may mean ignoring or increasing your long-term risks.
We believe long-term investors should invest for the long haul and focus more on risks to their goals and less on shorter-term worries over volatility.","Investing in stocks in volatile markets isn’t easy. Uncertainty and volatility can shake the faith of even the most optimistic and experienced investors. Investors often react by changing their investment strategies to reduce portfolio volatility. Sometimes this can make sense. But keep in mind, volatility is just one of many investment risks. Risk is multi-faceted and there is almost always a trade-off. Minimizing volatility can expose you to other, potentially more profound, risks.

We believe current economic uncertainty and market volatility concerns present a good opportunity to re-evaluate risk and what it means for you and your portfolio, both in the short and long term. We have found that investors tend to focus on short-term risk, notably volatility. But if you shift your perspective and focus to the long term, risk often looks very different. For example, one big long-term risk is that your portfolio fails to deliver the growth you need to meet your goals. This often happens when people don’t have an appropriate asset allocation or portfolio strategy aligned with those goals. Or they fail to account for inflation or a long investment time horizon.

Investors tend to see short-term volatility as their biggest risk

Story continues below advertisement

Volatility is a measure of how much a security’s returns vary over time. A security with very low volatility will offer a relatively steady rate of return. More-volatile securities, however, have a greater dispersion of returns, as measured by standard deviation from their average. In simple terms, more-volatile securities tend to have bigger swings in price. Risk, on the other hand, is a much more expansive concept that includes all uncertainties.

There is a tendency, however, to pay more attention to risk that is right in front of you. And most commonly when investors refer to “risk,” they’re referring to short-term volatility—stock prices moving down over a few days or weeks. Watching your investment accounts drop can be harrowing, but—if you don’t need to draw from these savings in the short term—short-term volatility may not pose a big risk to your long-term goals.

For example, if your investment time horizon is 10, 20 or 30 years, then short-term ups and downs over a few days, weeks or even months shouldn’t be a huge concern. Human psychology, however, makes it hard for us to stomach even short-term declines. Myopic loss aversion, a key principle of behavioural economics, identified by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, holds that, “when directly compared or weighted against each other, losses loom larger than gains.”[i] This means we tend to find a loss more painful than we find a similar or even larger gain pleasurable. This can cause investors to go to great lengths to avoid losses, even if it means sacrificing future gains.

However, over the long term, risk is different. Whilst investors are often most concerned with short-term declines, one of the biggest risks over the long term is that your portfolio’s growth falls short of what you need to reach your goals. Given this risk, adjusting your portfolio to reduce volatility, shifting your asset allocation out of stocks too soon or trying to time the market can all be risky over the long term.

Straying from your optimal asset allocation is dangerous

Investors who need portfolio growth over longer time horizons typically own equities for their history of strong long-term growth. If you have determined you need to be substantially invested in stocks in order to reach your goals, it can be dangerous to react to short-term volatility by departing from that asset allocation. Why? The long-term annualised return of equities is 8%, whilst fixed interest has returned 6.1%.[ii] The difference between these two long-term annualised returns may seem minor and an acceptable trade-off for less stomach-churning volatility. But consider that a $500,000 portfolio invested for 20 years that grew 8% annually would have a final value of $2,330,479—whereas a similarly sized portfolio invested for 20 years that grew at 6% annually would have a final value of $1,603,568. A 2% difference compounded over 20 years can result in a sizable difference in final portfolio value. That’s why asset allocation decisions—and the discipline to adhere to a portfolio strategy—are so important.

Then, too, if you deviate from your target asset allocation by selling some or all of your equities, you’ll face a second perilous decision: When should you reinvest in equities? In a month? When the market calms down? When everything feels safe? Unfortunately, in the short term, the stock market is almost impossible to predict and any attempt at market timing may be riskier than a buy-and-hold strategy. Stock market returns are highly uneven and it’s not unusual to see big gains in just a few trading days. Given that missing a handful of these big “up” days can be costly, we believe it often makes more sense to stay invested in equities.

Story continues below advertisement

Lastly, it is important to remember that a stock market correction—a sharp, sudden drop of -10% to -20%—is often followed by a recovery that is just as sharp and sudden. To benefit from selling out of equities during a correction, your timing would need to be impeccable. You would need to sell some or all of your equities early enough to dodge a substantial portion of the downturn. And you would need to buy back in so as not to miss out on the rebound. We know of no investor consistently able to do so. If you sold out of stocks too late or bought back in too late, you may have ended up experiencing a good deal of the downside and missed out on a substantial portion of the recovery. We believe the takeaway is, if you try to time equity markets to avoid short-term declines, there is a great likelihood you do yourself more harm than good.

Short-term volatility is a risk. But depending on your investment time horizon, it may not be your biggest risk. Quite simply, for many investors, the biggest risk is failing to achieve the growth they need to meet their long-term goals. Moreover, focusing on short-term risks alone may mean ignoring or increasing your long-term risks. Though it may be tempting at times, deviating from your optimal long-term asset mix just to reduce short-term volatility can make it less likely that you achieve the growth necessary to reach your long-term goals. We believe long-term investors should invest for the long haul and focus more on risks to their goals and less on shorter-term worries over volatility.

It starts with a stock market slump. Concern escalates to worry as you watch the financial news describe the precipitous drop—and speculate on a worsening outlook. Worry becomes full-blown anxiety as volatile markets devolve into a larger downturn.

It’s normal to experience anxiety and unease during turbulent stock markets or in the depths of a bear market. And these feelings aren’t just in your head. A 2014 University of California, San Diego study suggests that daily fluctuations in stock prices can have an almost immediate impact on the health of investors. The study found sharp stock market price drops are accompanied by an increasing number of hospital visits over the following two days—especially for mental-health reasons.[i]

Besides the potential physical and psychological toll, financial anxiety can also cause investors to make emotionally driven mistakes that could imperil their long-term financial goals. However, there are positive steps you can take to help combat those stressful feelings and avoid making costly investing mistakes that could jeopardise your financial future.

Take a media break

The addictive ping of social media and the squawk of always-on news can be constant sources of anxiety during market downturns. It’s good to stay informed, but spending too much time subject to relentless market updates and binging on social media can be detrimental if you’re not able to find some distance and regain perspective on current events or your longer-term investing goals. Consider taking a break from the news and social media to help keep yourself on an even keel. Maybe limit yourself to a set amount of time per day or per week. Stay informed, but try not to fixate on day-to-day market movements. Watch out for sensationalism and opinion in the content you consume and compare them against verifiable facts. In particular, social-media platforms or online blogs can often harbour hastily written or poorly researched information from dubious sources. So keep your guard up to avoid investing tips from sources lacking ethics, expertise or both.

You can get a compound effect if you layer more positive behaviours on top of your media break. For example, when you feel the social-media spiral and the financial news pulling you down, spend some time outside, go on a walk, start a project or get some exercise to help you reset your frame of mind.

Find a way to feel in control financially

Anxiety often comes from a lack of a sense of control. You may feel like events are sweeping you up and you’re powerless to do anything. Even though market moves are outside your control, you’re far from powerless during market downturns. There are a number of actions that can help restore your sense of financial control and curb anxiety.

Get your financial house in order: Investments are only one part of your overall financial picture. Exert financial control where you can. If you don’t have a financial plan, sit down with everyone affected by your monthly budget to prioritise necessities. If you’ve already got a financial plan, revisit your budget and priorities to make sure you know where your money is going. Then consider trimming any excesses you find. To help your short- and medium-term finances, make sure you have—or are working towards—an emergency fund to cover at least three months of expenses. An emergency fund can help if you encounter unexpected expenses or lose a portion of your income.

Revisit your investing goals; rebalance your portfolio if necessary: If you’ve got a financial plan in place, but it’s been a while since you’ve reviewed your previous goals in light of recent life events, now might be a good time to revisit it. If you find your long-term goals have changed or your portfolio has strayed too far from its targeted asset allocation, you might need to rebalance to get back in line.

If you’ve got a financial plan in place, but it’s been a while since you’ve reviewed your previous goals in light of recent life events, now might be a good time to revisit it. If you find your long-term goals have changed or your portfolio has strayed too far from its targeted asset allocation, you might need to rebalance to get back in line. Reframe “doing nothing” as an active choice: When markets are pitchpoling, it can feel like you’re tumbling along with them. It’s common to feel like you need to do something—others may be selling out of the market and insisting you should too. However, those feelings could move you further away from your financial goals if you sell at the wrong time and then miss out on a subsequent rebound. So what can you do? Doing nothing may be a better option if you already have a prudent investing plan with an optimal asset allocation. This may not feel good in the moment, but you can mentally reframe it. Think of it as an active decision to continue along a path that will likely pay off if you’re able to remain disciplined over the long run.

Your money manager should help educate you about common investing biases, such as myopic loss aversion, which describes the human tendency to feel the pain from losses much more than we feel the joy from gains. This bias has led many investors to sell stocks low after a crash—only to miss out on subsequent gains whilst waiting to get back into the market. Having open and honest conversations with your financial professional can help you avoid making mistakes that could significantly decrease the likelihood of achieving your long-term financial goals. The more frank you are with your investment professional, the more he or she can help set you up for financial success. A good professional should consider the curiosities, hesitations, passions and fears you’ve discussed to personalise their service and help you gain more confidence in your plan.

Financial anxiety is a common problem. Using some of these techniques to help give yourself more control and comfort can be a great first step on the path to a better financial future.

Many governments around the world have approved large fiscal- and monetary-aid packages designed to alleviate the economic toll of COVID-19 containment measures. Much of this spending will likely be financed through government borrowing. Some investors worry increasing government debt will stifle future economic growth or otherwise lead to market ruin. However, even as governments wade deeper into “red ink” in their effort to support families and businesses, we at Fisher Investments don’t believe that rising government debt automatically portends looming economic or market catastrophe.

This article examines how the stock market has historically responded to different government-debt levels in the US. We’ll look primarily through the lens of the United States, which serves as an insightful example since it has a large amount of outstanding government debt, is the world’s biggest stock market by market capitalization, and issues the most widely traded government-debt securities—US Treasurys.[i]

The US has large (and getting larger) debt burden, but that’s not the whole story

Story continues below advertisement

Congress allocated nearly $2.8 trillion in emergency aid as of mid-May and gross US federal debt that isn’t held by the government itself (i.e. net public debt) is now around $19.6 trillion.[ii] The scale of the 2020 fiscal measures—both announced and planned—is indeed significant, but how does that compare to other government responses? As of May 15, 2020, China’s fiscal response amounts to around 1.2 trillion yuan ($169 billion), while Japan added a ¥17 trillion ($157 billion) aid package to a previously approved 2020 budget. Meanwhile, the UK’s spending measures total around £175 billion ($214 billion). These amounts vary widely, but when normalized by comparing against each country’s economic output, the range varies from China’s 1.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) to the U.S.’s 13%.[iii]

In the U.S., the result is a ballooning 2020 budget deficit, which causes some investor concern. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an updated 2020 budget forecast on 24 April, in which the CBO estimates the U.S. will spend about $3.7 trillion more than it receives in taxes during fiscal year 2020.[iv] That deficit is financed through U.S. Treasury debt, which adds to the U.S. net public debt load. These estimates are all subject to change and reality may differ, but if debt makes you nervous, those figures are likely anxiety-inducing.

It’s the ability to service debt, not absolute debt levels that counts

In our view, a government’s ability to make scheduled interest and principal payments—what the financial industry likes to call “servicing debt”—is the most important consideration to monitor. You’ll often see government-debt levels compared to GDP as an approximation of a country’s ability to afford its debt. The idea is to compare what a country owes to what it generates in a single year—similar to how you’d compare a household’s debt to its income. However, we think focusing on absolute debt levels compared to GDP can be misleading. A country accumulates debt over decades, but GDP is an annual flow of economic activity, making this a useful but imperfect measure of affordability.

Ultimately, governments pay their creditors with revenue generated from taxes, so we believe a better way to evaluate a country’s ability to handle its current debt load is net interest costs as a percentage of tax revenue. By historical standards, U.S. government debt today appears very affordable. In 2019, interest payments’ share of tax revenue was lower than it was during most of the 1980s and 1990s. And those were overall great periods for U.S. stocks. Even with expected debt-level increases and tax-revenue declines this year and next, we believe U.S. debt should remain affordable.

Lower interest rates and longer maturities take off some additional pressure

Story continues below advertisement

There are a number of other factors that can affect a country’s ability to afford its debt. First, there’s the debt servicing cost, which is determined by interest rates. Historically low-interest rates around the world (and governments tend to enjoy some of the lowest rates) have kept borrowing costs low for many years. Additionally, with government bond yields at historic lows (and in some regions, actually negative), newly issued debt should take advantage of these low rates and relatively cheaper debt financing.

A second factor that affects the affordability of government debt is its maturity or the length of time for which the money is being borrowed. When government debt matures and the principal amount must be repaid, many governments, including that of the U.S., issue new debt to pay off the old. Refinancing at currently low rates means older, more-expensive debt can be replaced with newer, less-expensive debt. For example, since 2009, the U.S. Treasury has increased the average maturity of outstanding U.S. debt from less than 50 months to 69.2 months, as of the end of March 2020—effectively locking in lower rates for longer.[i] Similarly, the UK government has also been actively increasing the average maturity of its debt—known as gilts—which now sits at around 15.3 years.[ii] In either case, we believe interest rates would likely have to materially rise and stay elevated for years in order to significantly increase overall debt servicing costs in the US or UK.

A few final thoughts

In our view, stock markets typically price in information relevant for how the world will look between about 3 and 30 months from the present time. The long-term nature of government-debt obligations tends to fall outside of that window, blunting the impact to markets. Plus, while recently passed spending and aid packages are big, remember that they aren’t all permanent balance-sheet entries, and they may not cost as much as originally estimated. For example, in the U.S., $454 billion of the Federal Reserve’s monetary efforts backstops loans to small businesses. To the extent these loans are repaid, that money could be recouped. The Fed will also return interest on those loans to the Treasury, as it does all of its profits, further defraying the cost. Another $211 billion relief measure is deferred—but not canceled—employer payroll taxes. Finally, this increased spending is likely a one-time splurge, not a new, permanently higher spending plateau. Following the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent stimulus and bailout efforts, the U.S. budget deficit initially soared in 2009 but then fell for six straight years. So while the amounts may boggle the mind, we don’t believe government debt is signaling stock market ruin.

ZEW equity market sentiment index for the eurozone, August 2000 and February 2020.","Whilst every equity bear market (a fundamentally driven decline exceeding -20% from a prior high) has different specific circumstances and details, we think many of them—including the current one—have some commonalities. An important one, we think, is how sentiment evolves during a bear. Magnitudes, causes and durations vary—which may make bear markets seem bewildering. But in our experience, how people react emotionally to a bear is timeless.

For bull markets—periods of overall rising equity prices—we think legendary investor Sir John Templeton described sentiment’s path best: “Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on scepticism, mature on optimism and die on euphoria.” But this only takes you through market sentiment on the way up. For the other side of Templeton’s quote, Fisher Investments’ Founder, Executive Chairman & Co-Chief Investment Officer Ken Fisher reframed Templeton’s depiction: “Bear markets are born on euphoria, grow on grinding economics, mature on recession and die on panic.” This generally shows the development of bear markets, which are typically joined shortly thereafter by a period of broad-based economic contraction (a recession).

Now, 2020’s bear market didn’t follow this blueprint early on. It is fair to say sentiment wasn’t universally euphoric at the global equity market’s February peak, in our view. The ZEW sentiment index for eurozone equities was moderately positive in February at 21.6 (above zero is optimistic), but it was nowhere close to its 79.4 record high in 2000.[i] In the US, over 41% of investors were bullish, according to the American Association of Individual Investors’ survey, just above its average since 1987.[ii] Moreover, the economy didn’t begin contracting gradually this time—production suddenly stopped as COVID-19-related responses closed businesses, which halted growth.

Story continues below advertisement

The bear market’s unprecedented speed compressed the sentiment cycle, in our view. The MSCI World Index’s high was on 12 February, a couple weeks before shutdowns in Europe began.[iii] Then, reality still seemed sunny to us and many observers we follow. In late January, the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook projected global growth accelerating to 3.3% in 2020.[iv] Sentiment may have been optimistic, but it appeared justified and rational to us. Absent COVID-19’s global spread and the associated interruptions to business, that optimism may have eventually become euphoric. But the surprising institutional response to shut down business around the world cut the sentiment cycle’s progression short, in our view. Growing outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran brought rising alarm. Italy’s first case was announced on 20 February. But a full lockdown didn’t occur until 10 March. Business closures—for weeks, if not months—erased hope economic activity might avoid a big collapse.

A global recession looks increasingly likely from the early data rolling in. Whilst we think employment data are a lagging indicator, 17 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in March’s last three weeks.[v] Before this, there had never been a week above 700,000 in the series’ 53-year history.[vi] The eurozone composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI), combining manufacturing and services, plunged to 29.7 in March—well below the 50 level, which indicates contraction—in its biggest ever single-month drop.[vii] For the world, March’s global composite PMI fell to 39.4, its lowest level in 11 years.[viii]

Judging by financial publications we follow regularly, few would likely be surprised by recession—as sentiment seemingly reflects the bear market maturing. Forecasters from major financial firms project huge drops in Q2 gross domestic product (GDP, a government-produced measure of economic output) for most major economies. In early April, the IMF warned GDP could fall more than during the recession that accompanied 2008’s global financial crisis. Comparisons we read in the press go further. Many headlines we encounter suggest we are on the verge of another Great Depression—modern history’s biggest economic contraction on record. Many pundits we see argue the recovery, whenever it comes, will be hamstrung by high unemployment, business failures and rising government debt. To us, the mood appears rather panicky.

It isn’t clear if current sentiment marks the bear’s end. We think it will be clear only in hindsight, but the fear and panic we see isn’t unusual. We think markets, which efficiently discount widely known information, likely reflect that panic. A reality that doesn’t meet or exceed that should positively surprise investors. That is how, as Templeton put it, “Bull markets are born on pessimism.”

Whilst the current bear market is unique in its shocking speed, sentiment’s evolution to apparent panic suggests it may progress to a conclusion swiftly. Sentiment is unpredictable—and could always go lower—but the further it stretches expectations downward from likely outcomes, the easier it is for reality to positively surprise, in our view.

Think you’re smarter than average? Whilst this is mathematically true for only around half the population, we think most people would likely answer ‘yes.’ Regardless of whether you happen to be smarter than average, this sort of statistical impossibility is one example of people generally overestimating their abilities and skills—also known as overconfidence. Confidence can be a good thing but, in investing, overconfidence can lead to critical errors that may seriously hurt your chances at a comfortable retirement. Here we’ll explore where this bias comes from, some of the other cognitive errors that often accompany it, and why it can be one of the biggest factors standing between investors and their goals.

The Origins of Overconfidence

Overconfidence likely stems from behaviours that provided humans an advantage in the past. In hunter-gatherer societies, overconfidence may have been an evolutionary necessity—when the average work day involves chasing down an animal five times your size for dinner, it’s hard to be too confident. But modern life and investing are very different, and giving in to overconfidence these days can warp our investing habits for the worse.

Story continues below advertisement

Unfortunately, many other human tendencies contribute to overconfidence, making it a potentially powerful bias that’s difficult to overcome. For instance, we may naturally accumulate pride about our skills and accomplishments. In investing, pride accumulation occurs when investors attribute investing successes to what they believe are their skills, potentially ignoring the true underlying reasons (or even luck) that may have been involved. On the other side of that coin is regret shunning, which occurs when investors attribute their investing failures to outside forces instead of acknowledging personal mistakes and limitations.

Confirmation bias is another natural inclination that can feed into overconfidence and further wreak havoc on our decisions. Confirmation bias leads us to only pay attention to evidence that supports our pre-existing beliefs. We can see this in many aspects of life. Unless you love to argue, you probably spend more time with people who generally share your beliefs than with people who contradict your ideas at every opportunity. Similarly, most of us tune in to news sources that generally express our political beliefs. When investing, if you limit yourself to information that validates your existing beliefs, you’re essentially creating blind spots in your strategy. Markets are complex and dynamic. If you narrow your focus too much, you’re increasing the likelihood you miss something important that may impact your investments.

Another common error, hindsight bias, is also closely tied to pride accumulation and regret shunning. Hindsight bias is the feeling of ‘I knew it all along!’—even if that wasn’t the case. We have a tendency to remember the more prescient thoughts we had in advance of an eventual event and disregard the conflicting thoughts we had at the same time. For example, leading up to the 2008 global financial crisis, do you remember feeling a financial downturn was imminent? Were you concerned about the real estate market in the United States and subprime mortgages, and expected those concerns would impact equity markets? Now, if you did have these concerns, did you act on them? We’ve encountered many investors who say the downturn was obvious at the time, but still participated in the declines—classic hindsight bias. Inaccurately remembering past judgments like this can lead us to overestimate our future ability.

The Consequences of Overconfidence

Overconfidence—in conjunction with confirmation bias, hindsight bias and other cognitive errors—can lead to many poor investing choices that can significantly impact your financial future. Overconfident investors may overestimate their investment-picking ability, which can lead to making big bets and taking big risks.

For instance, have you ever bought into a ‘hot’ initial public offering or a potentially risky security because you remember past securities you ‘knew’ would do well before they surged? Was your choice based on careful, thorough, impartial analysis? Because hindsight could be a factor, and if that leads you to make a big, risky investment, you could be taking on more risk than you should due to bias.

Owning too few equities is another potentially damaging strategy to which overconfident investors may fall victim. If you own just a handful of individual equities in your portfolio, you’re likely making large, risky bets. Investing in equities always carries the risk of loss—no matter your confidence level. However, you can lower your individual security risk by diversifying your portfolio with at least a few dozen equities from various industries and geographies. An extreme case of this error occurs when investors hold their own employer’s shares as a large portion of their investment portfolio. You may think you work for a great company, but virtually no one but the most senior executives truly knows the direction of the company, and sometimes even they don’t know an equity-tanking scandal is about to unfold.

Consider the case of Enron employees in the 2000s—those who invested in Enron’s shares in their retirement plans not only lost their jobs when the company folded, but also lost their retirement savings. Workers for Parmalat in Italy or Swissair in Switzerland may have encountered similar situations if they decided to hold large investments in their company’s shares prior to the company’s equity losing its value.

Avoiding Overconfidence

How can you avoid making these mistakes? Given all the various ways investors can fall prey to overconfidence, it may seem overwhelming. But you can take several steps to help stay humble and prudent when investing.

To begin, flip your natural tendencies on their heads by shunning pride and accumulating regret. You can always be wrong in your investing choices—even the most legendary investors don’t get it right all of the time. In fact, if you were right just 70% of the time over the long term, you would likely be an investing legend. Look for opportunities to recognise your mistakes and take responsibility for them. Revel in them a while. Learn from them. And remember, not all of your past investing successes can be attributed to your own skill—luck is often a factor. For proof, consider keeping a journal of your investing thoughts and comparing how often they actually aligned with market performance. Revisit it often—how frequently were your thoughts or predictions actually aligned with real market movement? If you made a market decision, check to see if it made you worse or better off. Even if you did well, did you actually outperform relative to other similar investments? If you are able to learn from the times you were mistaken, you may have a better chance of avoiding similar mistakes in the future.

You can also consider using a trusted financial adviser or coach to help you stay on the path towards your goals. Avoiding common investing mistakes can be difficult, especially when working on your own. An adviser may be able to help provide an impartial perspective and investing expertise. Finally, study markets as much as possible. But be wary as you gather your information and don’t forget the impact of confirmation bias. Do your best to seek out multiple sources of information, including those that may present opposing beliefs or viewpoints from your own.

Although you can never be fully rid of biases, you can be more aware of them and know how to minimise their impacts on your investing decisions. Whilst behavioural biases apply to many aspects of life, making financial mistakes because of them can have far-reaching consequences. They may actually hinder your ability to retire or live the comfortable retirement you’ve been working towards. So don’t forget to check your biases at the door when you start investing—and continue to re-evaluate them every day.

Langdon Hall This summer’s best socially-distanced lunch spot makes a perfect road trip from Toronto

An easy hour’s drive from downtown Toronto, Langdon Hall’s manicured grounds and forest setting turns a simple picnic into an experience to be remembered.

Brought to you by Long-haul travel might not be on the table for Canadians yet, but fortunately there’s still plenty to discover in our own backyards. Brought to you by Lexus, this series highlights experiences in your backyard and beyond to be found behind the wheel of a Lexus SUV. For this year's best trips, getting there is half the fun.

With many of our favourite restaurants closed for so much of the past year, we’re all craving a bit of culinary adventure these days. Langdon Hall in Cambridge, Ontario is a luxury country hotel renowned for its manicured grounds, top-rated spa and sumptuous guest rooms, but it’s their innovative menu offerings that make it one of this summer’s most compelling destinations. As a trusted Lexus partner, Langdon Hall also offers exclusive privileges for Lexus Owners, making it all the more welcoming a destination for summer road trips.

The Lexus RX luxury SUV offers a modern sculpted exterior, and a cabin featuring thoughtful details crafted by Lexus Takumi artisans.

The elegant estate’s onsite restaurant, led by executive chef Jason Bangerter, has long held a lofty reputation. This season’s hottest reservation, however, isn’t at a table – it’s on the lawn. For $235, guests can reserve a gourmet picnic basket for two, to be picked up for safe, socially distanced consumption outdoors on a chosen Sunday afternoon.

An easy hour’s drive from downtown Toronto – and a welcome excuse for a road-trip in the luxurious Lexus RX – Langdon Hall’s romantic setting turns a simple picnic lunch into an experience to be remembered. The hotel’s expansive property, its secluded location down a long winding road, and its perimeter of dense Carolinian forest foliage all shelter the lawn in quiet, natural splendour. Plus, in classic country estate fashion, the neatly trimmed gardens showcase Victorian landscaping at its best. Rows of manicured shrubs and lush flower beds filled with vibrant colours and fragrant scents reflect the hard work of expert green thumbs.

Varying weekly, the contents of the takeout picnic basket reflect the kitchen’s commitment to using only the freshest seasonal, local ingredients. Much like the engineers and craftspeople at Lexus, who obsess over the most minute details to deliver a beautifully crafted experience, Langdon Hall’s culinary team is devoted to exceeding expectations at every turn. Expect a spread of artisanal cheeses sourced from surrounding farms, an imaginative and elevated entree of locally-sourced meats and heirloom veggies, and a dessert that makes the most of Ontario fruit at the peak of its season. All you need to bring is your appetite and a picnic blanket.

Setting out for Langdon Hall from Toronto, the drive passes through scenic Cambridge, Ontario, which includes no shortage of historic stone architecture along the picturesque Grand River. (Heading over this body of water along Main Street Bridge affords an especially great view of the city’s majestic downtown library, a striking modern glass addition to the former Galt Post Office.) Put on a favourite playlist, enjoying the concert-like experience of the optional 15 Speaker Mark Levinson Premium Surround Sound Audio System, and don’t be afraid to explore a few intriguing side streets along the way using the available 12.3-inch touchscreen display, compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. After all, the best summer road trips are about discovery and exploration.

The estate’s onsite restaurant, led by executive chef Jason Bangerter, is ranked as one of the best in Canada.

Of course, Ontario isn’t the only place to enjoy a gourmet picnic this summer. In Quebec, Cabane D'à Côté – part of chef Martin Picard’s Au Pied de Cochon empire of eateries – opens up its orchard for picnics, complete with delicacies like bison tartare, traditional smoked ham and Picard’s signature salted maple caramel cookies. British Columbia’s Okanagan Valley is in on the action, too, with Uprooted Kitchen & Catering Co. offering four-course “Basket Case Picnics” to enjoy alongside a view of Okanagan Lake. Meanwhile, Atlantic drivers can book their own Parks Canada picnic baskets – anchored by crab or lobster sandwiches, naturally – to be picked up in Ingonish, Nova Scotia for lunch along the breathtaking Cabot Trail.

Choose Your Ride: The Lexus RX Much like Langdon Hall’s thoughtfully renovated property, the Lexus RX luxury SUV – the vehicle that established Lexus as a leader in the SUV segment over 20 years ago – offers a modern sculpted exterior that makes a bold statement curbside. A sumptuously crafted cabin features abundant space and thoughtful details crafted by Lexus Takumi artisans, while a tinted panoramic moonroof overhead proves ideal for stargazing pit stops. A generous 12.3” available display aids in off-the-beaten-path navigation, while Lexus Safety System+ 2.0 driver assist technology introduces helpful supports like Lane Trace Assist and Pre-collision with Pedestrian and Bicycle Detection for ultimate peace of mind.

Balnea’s thermal circuit of Finnish-style saunas, hot tubs, and cold water pools is the perfect way to relax, detox and bliss out under the trees.

Brought to you by Long-haul travel might not be on the table for Canadians yet, but fortunately there’s still plenty to discover in our own backyards. Brought to you by Lexus, this series highlights experiences in your backyard and beyond to be found behind the wheel of a Lexus SUV. For this year’s best trips, getting there is half the fun.

Sometimes the best way to rebuild a sense of momentum is to step on the gas pedal. After an anxious spring spent at home, there’s never been a more satisfying time to get behind the wheel, especially if the wheel in question is attached to the Lexus NX 300h Self-Charging Hybrid Electric SUV. Montreal drivers craving a therapeutic escape should head to Balnea Spa in Quebec’s Eastern Townships. Located just an hour’s drive outside of the city, the resort is tucked well off the beaten path on the glassy waters of Lake Gale. Getting here, however, is easy thanks to Lexus Enform’s Destination Assist, which offers intuitive navigation and 24-hour access to a live response centre agent, or through your smartphone’s maps app connected via Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. Calm and spiritual, Balnea’s setting works to lull visitors into a state of deep relaxation long before their spa visit officially begins – especially if arriving using the Lexus NX 300h’s silent drive when in electric mode.

This summer, guests have an opportunity to develop an even deeper connection with the landscape than usual. To maintain social distancing parameters while preserving a calm atmosphere, Balnea has developed a Nature Immersion package that makes use of shaded, private outdoor relaxation stations. This way, guests can meditate or relax with a good book without unwanted interruptions. Stations are available in three pastoral settings – the Summit, the Valley, or the Lake – but no matter where one chooses to settle for the day, the view is guaranteed to be breathtaking. With the fresh scents and gentle sounds of the forest all around you, it’s the perfect way to centre yourself, slow down, and be inspired by the natural world. Much like the efficient hybrid powertrain in the Lexus NX 300h, which goes further on a tank of fuel, a day at Balnea is all about existing in harmony with the natural world.

To ensure that guests undergo a physical reset as powerful as their mental one, the Nature Immersion package also includes access to Balnea’s thermal circuit of Finnish-style saunas, hot tubs, and cold water pools. Inspired by traditional Scandinavian rituals, these offerings facilitate a rapid cycle of hot and cold environments that has been proven to improve blood circulation, relax tense muscles, and establish calmer breathing. For those seeking a more physical way to release some endorphins, open water swimming in Lake Gale and serene hiking trails are also on offer at Balnea.

Of course, sweating, swimming and hiking are all activities that promise to work up an appetite. Thankfully, Balnea Spa also celebrates the therapeutic powers of an artfully prepared meal. An original menu developed by Luc Pinard directs the chef’s talents, previously offered at Balnea Spa’s acclaimed LUMAMI restaurant, to a three-course gourmet lunch box. After all, you can’t expect to find inner peace on an empty stomach.

Those seeking spa experiences in other provinces have their own choice of safe havens to consider. In Collingwood, Ontario, Scandinave Spa Blue Mountain has modified its operations to facilitate social distancing by establishing a reduced capacity and clearly demarcated zones to help guests adhere to health and safety recommendations. Kananaskis Nordic Spa outside of Calgary has adopted similar measures, while also extending the time between private appointments to allow for thorough sanitization. Meanwhile in B.C., Halcyon Hot Springs Resort is now operating its hot springs exclusively for those who book a two-night package at its onsite hotel, which is operating at half-occupancy with no-contact check-in and service. Ultimately, all of these destinations are taking care to ensure that 2020′s anxieties don’t get in the way of your rejuvenating escape.

Choose Your Ride: The Lexus NX 300h It isn’t easy to compete with the lush green mountains and sparkling lakes of Quebec’s Eastern Townships, but Lexus’s midsize SUV is stylish enough to turn heads wherever your journey may take you. Its eco-friendly hybrid powertrain achieves impressive fuel economy without the need to plug into a charging station, along with a serene, silent ride. Lexus Enform 2.0 technology, compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, also allows for remote car starting, so your ride is comfortably awaiting you as soon as you’re ready to hit the road. And thanks to a driver-centric interior complete with thoughtful details courtesy of the Lexus Takumi craftsmanship, drivers will feel relaxed even when it isn’t spa day.

There’s a certain magic that happens when people are reunited with foods that remind them of their roots. It’s something that Andrea Macikova and Vlad Forgac witness regularly at YourOh! Deli, the authentic European delicatessen they run in Langley, B.C.

Forgac recalls one of these special moments last summer, when a customer spotted a European chocolate bar she hadn’t seen since her childhood.

“She stopped in her tracks,” Forgac says. “She slowly walked over and began welling up, saying, ‘I used to eat these when I was a little girl.’”

“She picked one up and held it with such admiration that I was moved,” he says. “That’s when I knew a European deli was much more than just a little food store.”

Open this photo in gallery Langley, B.C.'s YourOh! Deli prides itself on serving the highest-quality European imported goods. SUPPLIED

Serving specialty goods from throughout the 27 European Union (EU) state members has become more than a business for the pair; it’s a passion.

Macikova hails from Vranov Nad Topl’ou in Eastern Slovakia, while Forgac is originally from Bratislava, the country’s capital. The pair launched YourOh! Deli in December 2018. (The name is meant to sound like “Euro.”) The 900-square-foot shop quickly became a neighbourhood draw with products from all over Europe – represented on a map that adorns one shop wall.

Operating in a multicultural region like B.C.‘s Lower Mainland, a 45-minute drive from Vancouver, YourOh! Deli has a diverse clientele. Many shoppers have roots in Eastern Europe, including Romania, Croatia, and the Czech Republic. For this reason, the deli stocks a variety of food products that allow customers to connect with their culture, while helping others discover the true taste of Europe for the first time. Think Pawelek chocolate bars from Poland; Erfrischungsstäbchen lemon-orange chocolates from Germany; Burek cheese pies, popular in Croatia and Slovenia; Slovakian Oštiepok smoked sheep cheese; or Hungarian peppers stuffed with sauerkraut.

As was the case for so many businesses, COVID-19 introduced new challenges for YourOh! Deli. Macikova and Forgac initially curtailed their hours, developed an online ordering platform and offered private shopping to ensure their clientele could continue to access the high-quality European goods they treasured during the pandemic’s darkest hours.

What the couple found, however, was that the overwhelming majority of customers still wanted to shop in person, to look at labels and designations and read about the products – despite limitations and lineups presented by physical distancing orders. Currently, up to three people are permitted in the store at a time, and it’s not uncommon to see customers waiting patiently outside for their turn. Macikova and Forgac attribute this to carrying authentic European goods and working hard to continually diversify their EU offerings to ensure variety for their clientele.

“The most important element in solidifying our client base has been adapting to our customers,” Forgac says. “We’re constantly branching out, contacting new suppliers and importers and bakeries and meat producers.”

Luckily, The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), has opened even more opportunities for businesses like YourOh!, making storied European products readily available to Canadian food retailers and consumers alike.

“We have a huge number of customers from Eastern Europe who are extremely passionate about the foods they grew up with,” he says. “So, for them to come in and find items they are familiar with is huge. And for them to know that we will do what we can to seek out and bring in items we don’t have in stock is forging the whole ‘neighbourhood European deli’ mission we set out initially.”

More and more, people want to know where their food comes from. With traditional and authentic European foods, customers should look for EU Geographical Indications. The distinctive red and yellow stamp identifies that the ingredients, production and preparation of a product are all from or took place in a specific geographical area. The blue and yellow stamp is used to identify the products in which a particular quality of production is attributed to its geographic origin. These labels ensure that what customers are buying is authentic and of the highest quality standards.

For Macikova and Forgac, the foods they carry act as a bridge between people and places. By stocking the best of Europe, they aim to help satisfy consumers’ appetites for food that offers a real experience, combined with high safety standards – that feeds their souls as much as their stomachs.

It was midway through March when Joe Moscato, vice president of sales and marketing at Aurora Importing, noticed pantry items like dried pasta, polenta, rice, canned tomatoes, canned beans, tuna and olive oil flying off shelves.

Seemingly overnight, demand for staples skyrocketed by up to 400 per cent as lockdown orders fell into place and Canadians pivoted to eating every meal at home. Staff across the family-run importing and distributing company worked around the clock to meet rapidly changing consumer demands for their favourite European foods.

Aurora was far from alone in the challenges it faced: COVID-19 disrupted the entire global food supply chain, affecting everyone from the workers planting and harvesting crops to the grocery store clerks stocking shelves.

Story continues below advertisement

Looking back, Moscato credits the company’s ability to rise to the challenge to its legacy as one of the largest, most reliable, well-resourced importers of authentic European goods into Canada.

“We have longstanding partnerships with many of our suppliers and producers,” Moscato says. “Despite the onset of COVID-19 in Europe and here in Canada during the first outbreak in mid-March, we were well-positioned to supply the market’s unprecedented demand.”

For many consumers, spending time at home has underscored the importance of high-quality imported ingredients. Increases in demand for popular products meant many goods were hard to get ahold of; but Moscato and his team at Aurora worked hard to ensure that Canadians were able to connect with the European foods they’d come to know and love.

In fact, keeping up with consumer needs has always been a part of Aurora’s DNA: In 1955, Nunzio Tumino, a new immigrant from Sicily, opened a grocery store in the west end of Toronto. On his trips back to Italy, Tumino’s immigrant customers often asked him to bring back the foods they missed. He started supplying other local retailers with specialty European foods like oils, canned tomatoes and pasta, and eventually, Aurora became one of the first major importing companies in Canada.

To this day, the organization continues to be driven by a desire to unite members of the European diaspora with foods from their roots while offering other Canadians the opportunity to explore new cuisines. Though Aurora began with Italian products, they’ve expanded and now source foods from all over Europe, including ale beer from Germany, and speculoos biscuits from Belgium (or ‘speculaas’ if from the Netherlands.)

Open this photo in gallery SUPPLIED

“Italian is who we are at our core and that will never change,” Moscato says. “But as the Canadian demographics continue to evolve and diversify, so do we.”

Products like Aurora’s play as vital a role on Canadians’ shelves as they do within the national economy: According to Sylvain Charlebois, professor and senior director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University, Canada’s unique weather patterns pose limits to what’s possible to produce from home. Imports are left to fill in gaps.

Story continues below advertisement

“Our growing season is limited compared to many other nations,” Charlebois says. “We’re at the mercy of mother nature.”

He adds that importing food strengthens Canada’s economy as a whole. “As a trading nation, you can benefit from relationships you build abroad,” he says. “Maybe the initial intent is to buy [food from other countries], but you may end up buying other stuff and building relationships with companies that eventually buy more products from Canada.”

This became easier after the 2017 passage of The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the European Union (EU), which offers protection for European and Canadian foods with Geographical Indications (GIs), ensuring that products are from where they say they are. For example, Aurora products like Aceto Balsamico di Modena (PGI) – a vinegar from the Modena region – and Pomodoro San Marzano dell’Agro Sarnese-Nocerino (PDO) – tomatoes grown under the shade of Mount Vesuvius in San Marzano sul Sarno – are labelled with GIs to confirm their geographic authenticity. These EU labels guarantee the authenticity of products, as well as their high quality and strict production standards.

This kind of protection is vital given the sheer diversity of Europe, its cultures and its culinary traditions, Charlebois notes.

The Montreal-based, French-trained chef and entrepreneur peppers his conversations, his cooking and his classes with stories.

“When I’m giving a cooking class, I tell a story about a Nonna in Italy,” he says. “She’s going to cook a simple polenta for her family, and you know what? That’s what we’re making today, it’s going to be delicious, use authentic ingredients and you can make it, too.”

Through his cooking lessons and social media channels, Garnier’s students enthusiastically cook polenta, vegetarian polpette and fresh pasta. Throughout all aspects of La Guilde Culinaire, the chef’s boutique and culinary school in Montreal’s Little Italy, he places emphasis on quality ingredients, taste and technique, skillfully blending local Quebec ingredients with the fine European foods he loves, like Italian Pecorino Romano (PDO) and Spanish Jamón Serrano (PGI).

Story continues below advertisement

“Each of these products have their stories,” Garnier says. “The tastes are always honest and authentic, and come with their own history and perfected technique based on years of producer experience, history and tradition.”

Garnier shares the stories of these flavours with his students, too. “I love the tradition of charcuterie from the Baltics and get my students to taste the dry sausages and cold cuts with local beer,” he says. “Or I send them to Montreal’s great cheese stores to look for the flavour profiles in the same kind of cheese from different countries, like Feta cheese (PDO) from Greece and Bulgarian traditional soft cheeses. When they start to detect these differences…they’re truly learning and enjoying.”

With both his large-event catering services and grab-and-go lunch counter in downtown Montreal suspended for the moment, La Guilde Culinaire’s online kitchen equipment and pantry ingredient boutique – stocked aplenty with authentic European Union’s (EU) goods, like Paella rice from Valencia, Spain and infused vinegar and olive oils from France – has become the power engine of the business. “We’re shipping four to five times more during this time than pre-COVID,” the chef says. “Everyone is cooking at home now.”

This offers a unique learning opportunity for Garnier’s students – more than ever before, Canadians are making moments in their own kitchens, uniting over quality local and imported ingredients and sharing meals made with love. By bringing the best European imports into the homes of Canadians, Garnier has brought many back to their roots, while taking others into a new world of taste.

With The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) in place between the European Union and Canada, European products are within easier reach than some might expect for importers, retailers and consumers in Canada. Whether cheeses, meats, olive oils, fruits, produce, confectionery, beer or wine, European products are uniquely positioned to meet the changing preferences and appetites of the Canadian shopper, who places an ever-greater premium on quality, safety and authenticity.

Garnier leverages the accessibility to EU products in his cooking philosophy, based on what he calls his “little drawers of taste”: banks of flavour that he keeps in his mind from his travels and training and uses to inform every dish. Finding the correct, authentic ingredients to fit in each drawer has been essential to his creative process as a chef. “Think about olives from Greece or Spain, and combining them with Quebec pork – it’s terrific,” he says. “Or pistachios from Italy and local double cream. You’ll make the most delicious ice cream you’ve ever had.”

Open this photo in gallery French Comté cheese (PDO) and Italian Mortadella di Bologna (PGI) ravioli. More Than Food

Knowing where an ingredient is coming from is key. Garnier looks for European Union Geographical Indications – products carrying the blue or yellow seal Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) and Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) confirming a product’s origins and authenticity – to ensure that what he’s buying is the real deal.

Story continues below advertisement

“I tell my students to get all the information they can about a product before they buy it and serve it to their friends and family,” Garnier says. “Then they can tell the story of the origins of the food and the history of the producers. That’s as much part of the sharing as the cooking.”

“I’m always going to put love into my food,” the convivial chef adds. “And with European ingredients, we can always share a great story, too.”

Bruce Cockburn and jazz singer Holly Cole are some of the Canadians icons headlining the schedule for the Royal Conservatory of Music this fall and winter and both are artists who have enjoyed national and international acclaim.

The Royal Conservatory, a “music education institution” founded on the principle that personal growth is channelled through the arts, has alumni of such renowned names as Oscar Peterson, Glenn Gould, Sarah McLachlan, Diana Krall, Gordon Lightfoot, k.d. lang and Cockburn.

Mervon Mehta, executive director of performing arts at The Royal Conservatory, says blending in Canadian icons is vital to their programming since they opened Koerner Hall 10 years ago. The venue showcases top-flight artists from across the jazz, classical, world music, folk and pop genres.

“Quite naturally, many have been Canadian,” Mehta says. This season the Royal Conservatory has 100 concerts and 51 of those feature Canadian artists.

That tells you everything about the demand. Canadian audiences take pride in Canadian artistic talent, but won’t go just because it’s the patriotic thing to do.

“Canadian musicians can go toe-to-toe with musicians from around the world in any genre,” Mehta says. “We proudly present them without caveat and without quotas. We also love to introduce our audiences to newer artists who we think show promise and need a larger platform.”

Of the Canadian headliners for the coming season three are already sold out (Cockburn, Cole and Adrianne Pieczonka) and several others are close (Karina Gauvin, Toronto Sings the Breithaupt Brothers, Amici Ensemble with Russell Braun, Louis Lortie, Oscar Peterson’s Africa, Angela Hewitt and Jan Lisiecki).

Cockburn plays Oct. 19 and Cole plays Dec. 14.

In Brampton, the Rose Theatre has a lineup this fall featuring Canadian legend Burton Cummings, rock quartet Sloan and a tribute to the late, great Gord Downie of The Tragically Hip.

Formed in Halifax in 1991, Sloan, now based in Toronto, just released its 12th studio album. A CBC Critics’ Poll had the Juno Award-winning band as one of Canada’s top bands of all time. Sloan plays on Oct. 10.

Story continues below advertisement

It’s been almost two years since Downie, the former frontman of The Tragically Hip, died, and Canada lost one of its true music icons. One of his legacies was his work on the reconciliation with Canada’s First Peoples.

The tribute concert at The Rose on Oct. 16 will feature a group of Canadian artists, in collaboration with The Gord Downie & Chanie Wenjack Fund, promoting awareness and education about the issue and celebrating Downie, his music and legacy. (Gord’s Legacy will also be performed on Oct. 18 at First Ontario Performing Arts Centre and at the Burlington Performing Arts Centre on Oct. 17.)

Cummings needs no introduction – the legendary singer, songwriter and recording artist was with Canada’s original rock ‘n’ roll superstars, The Guess Who, and then followed that with a long solo career featuring dozens of hit singles and albums. His Up Close and Alone show runs at The Rose on Nov. 28.

There is no shortage of Canadian talent around the province this fall and winter. Other notable concerts include: award-winning Canadian singer-songwriter Loreena McKennitt at Roy Thomson Hall on Nov. 1; Avril Lavigne plays TO Live’s Meridian Hall (formerly the Sony Centre) on Oct. 6; Jann Arden plays Casino Rama Resort on Dec. 7; Celine Dion is at Scotiabank Theatre on Dec. 9; and Blue Rodeo is at the Barrie Molson Centre on Dec. 29.

If one had to boil down what audiences will get out of this upcoming season at Young People’s Theatre, it’s this, says artistic director Allen MacInnis: the Seven Ancestral Teachings.

Rooted deep in Anishinaabe culture, they are respect, humility, bravery, honesty, love, wisdom and truth, and act as signposts by which to live and work well. Each of this year’s productions in YPT’s 2019/2020 season explores one or more of these seven teachings.

“I think we live in a time when we need to think about what makes us do what we do. How do we do better? And thinking about these things doesn’t have to be done in a full or overly serious way. Sometimes it’s in something entertaining and fun and delightful that we realize what’s good in the world and in us,” MacInnis says.

Anyone in the theatre community will tell you about the importance of volunteers, many of whom step up to help any way they can, just for the love of it.

There is no better feeling of community than what comes with being a volunteer, establishing longlasting emotional connections with other people who have that same level of interest and passion for local theatre, the arts and the not-for-profit community.

When Rose Theatre in Brampton, Ont., asked its volunteers why they get involved, the top three responses were: to give back to the community; to stay active; and to be a part of theatre and arts culture. Volunteering in the arts is particularly important to seniors and retirees. At the Rose, these are the lobby greeters, theatre ushers, ticket takers, coat-check people and event hosts.

“Their contribution to theatre and arts and culture in Brampton is something that cannot be measured in hours or shifts worked, but in exceptional service and connections created,” says Cristina Rizzuto, co-ordinator for performing arts marketing at the Rose. “Our volunteers welcome our patrons to the theatre as though they are welcoming them home.”

The McMichael Canadian Art Collection has a core of 150 volunteers who serve on the board of trustees, the McMichael Youth Team, the McMichael Volunteer Committee and with staff members on the Moonlight Gala, the McMichael’s signature annual fundraiser.

Those volunteers assist visitors, participate in community outreach and provide crucial event support throughout the year. Their gallery docents are trained volunteers who lead visitors on interactive tours of the gallery’s ground and exhibitions.

Roberta Smith, vice-president and chief of staff for the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, says volunteers are “vital to the success of the TSO.”

The Toronto Symphony Volunteer Committee, with 150 members and which has been in existence almost as long as the TSO itself, is credited with bolstering the financial health of the TSO and with helping to expand awareness of its musical and education programs. That includes hosting fundraising events such as wine auctions and marathons.

“They are not only ambassadors for the orchestra, but they are very much like family,” she says.

Stacey Arppe, volunteer manager at the Canadian Canoe Museum in Peterborough, Ont., actually keeps a tally of the number of hours booked in by museum’s 180 volunteers: 19,648 hours were logged in 2018 by the people who support every department and program at the museum.

“A large contingent of our volunteers are paddlers themselves with a passion for canoeing, camping and outdoor pursuits,” says Arppe.

“We consciously strive to foster a strong sense of community among our volunteers, so some join us to network, meet new people and connect with like-minded individuals.”

One of those volunteers, Dale Standen, says he is a historian and canoeist, with a connection to the museum going back to its roots. Again, the payoff for volunteers like Standen is the emotional connection to the topic and what the museum or gallery represents both personally and to the community.

“The museum’s collection is unparalleled in its richness, and its preservation is an important project,” he says.

“Working with people who share the same sense of the value of the museum to the community is personally rewarding. It is also fun.”

Walter Emrich, a collections and exhibition volunteer at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre, at Queen’s University in Kingston, was a practising doctor who retired four years ago. His aim was to volunteer in an area different from his professional life. This is popular thinking among retirees who volunteer.

Story continues below advertisement

After becoming a member at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre just before retiring, he soon found that the gallery’s collection numbered more than 17,000 items, and that there were collection managers and curators who all needed help. That’s how he jumped in.

His job is to do collections condition reporting – doing a walk around the gallery on a weekly basis, looking for any changes in all the exhibited artwork. That could be aging factors such as paint flaking off an oil painting, or paintings warping. It could be contact of the works with gallery visitors or attendants, such as fingerprints or dust on frames.

“After reviewing the various pieces for several weeks I feel like I have a personal relationship and attachment with that work,” Emrich says.

“I’m allowed to be in an environment of creativity and am able to give my time to help in a small way to maintain and preserve that creativity, so that others may benefit from it.”

It is certainly the notion of giving back that appeals to many volunteers.

“At this point in my life I feel an obligation to give something back, to share the knowledge I have accumulated and to mentor others. Volunteering at Agnes provides me with an opportunity to do that,” says Christina MacLachlan, community docent at Agnes.

Young and old, volunteers are crucial to the arts community. Opera Atelier’s crew of volunteers, called on to help out in the office, on larger projects and mailings, especially for the annual gala, are a core group of friendly, dedicated opera lovers.

“From mailings to helping staff our gala and our education/outreach programs, volunteers are the reason it all works,” says Rebekah Lobosco Gilli, development manager for Opera Atelier.

Toronto’s Tarragon Theatre calls on 100 to 120 volunteers each season to cover off duties such as front-of-house usher, as well as to provide gala and administration assistance.

“We do offer the opportunity to see the performances when they’ve assisted us, so that’s certainly a motivator,” says Cameron Johnston, director of marketing for Tarragon Theatre.

“Beyond that, Tarragon volunteers are genuinely passionate about the work we’re doing. They’re our best, most honest audience.”

The idea that art imitates life has been around for centuries and there’s a good reason for it.

Real life stories resonate with an audience, grabbing their emotions, whether it be a theatre production, musical performance, art piece or a photographic exhibition.

“Those who don’t remember history are doomed to repeat it,” says Clyde Wagner, president and chief executive officer of TO Live, which is putting on the major exhibition Mandela.

“That’s critical at this time, particularly here in North America as I think we see value-based movements in your marketplace. When we were approached by the Canadian Human Rights Museum … it didn’t take us five seconds to say yeah we would like to do [the exhibition],” Wagner says.

“The reason we want to do it is because it’s germane to our mandate, which is to reflect the city on the stage but also to create public dialogue around important topics of the day, and the topic of equality, diversity and human rights is one that’s being questioned I find.”

A rich sensory experience of imagery, soundscape, digital media and objects, Mandela explores Nelson Mandela’s fight for justice and human dignity in South Africa. Among the exhibition’s many dramatic visual features and original artifacts is a replica of Mandela's eight-foot by seven-foot prison cell.

Previously known as Civic Theatres Toronto, TO Live is one of Canada’s largest multi-arts organizations, operating three iconic venues and presenting a full range of performing arts, theatrical and concert events in both downtown and uptown Toronto at Meridian Hall (formerly the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts), St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts and the Meridian Arts Centre (formerly the Toronto Centre for the Arts).

“Art or the creative arts in any format – visual arts, music, dance, theatre, architecture, design all of these things – have a way to inspire people and engage with the public that is both able to be accepted by a broad audience but also emotionally connected to a topic,” Wagner says.

“Great art can touch people whether it has a social message or not. If it has a social message like the exhibition … then it also falls into a category of things that we’re inspired to do.”

Andrey Tarasiuk is artistic director at Pleiades Theatre, which is presenting Besbouss: An Autopsy of a Revolt, the English-language premiere of a story inspired by the headlines and running in November. It’s based on the Arab Spring uprisings in Tunisia that were triggered by the self-immolation of a street vendor named Mohamed Bouazizi in 2010.

“For me, essential to this play is it really sort of sits in a place where it asks the question: ‘Can one person make a difference?’ … The play is the starting point for a conversation is how I view this production,” he says.

“The issues don’t escape us. I think it behooves artists to examine global events and the impact of those global events on all of us and to be fearless in posing questions. Why is this happening? And what are the consequences? How do these events impact on our lives? These are critical and imperative questions that need to be responded to by artists. I feel very strongly about that and artists are up to that task,” Tarasiuk adds.

Majdi Bou-Matar, director of Besbouss, says art tells stories by taking historical events and figures as source material but then making it more relevant way to audiences today.

“Real events in history is material out there that belongs to anyone. The main thing is how do we use those events as a tool to tell our stories in the here and now,” he says.

While the modern hybrid vehicle seems like a relatively new invention, it’s been on the scene for two decades.

The first hybrid sold in North America was the original Honda Insight, which debuted in December 1999. It was revolutionary: a compact hatchback with slick aerodynamics and an advanced hybrid powertrain that consumed just 4.4 litres of fuel per 100 kilometres (4.4 L/100 km) in combined driving.

Since breaking the mold at the start of the millennium, the engineers at Honda have spent the past 20 years perfecting the hybrid powertrain, with models such as the Honda Civic Hybrid (2001 to 2015), the original Honda Accord Hybrid (2005 to 2007) and the Honda CR-Z (2010 to 2016). These vehicles used a different version of the manufacturer’s Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) system, in which an electric motor is mounted between the internal combustion engine (ICE) and the transmission.

Car buyers loved them. By the end of 2012, Honda had sold a million hybrid-powered vehicles around the world. Since then, the Honda hybrid fleet has gone from strength to strength, unveiling better technology, increased efficiency, and more bang for the buck.

For the new model year, Canadians have three Honda hybrids to choose from, with the 2020 Honda Clarity Plug-In Hybrid, the 2020 Honda Accord Hybrid and the 2020 Honda Insight Hybrid.

Some auto makers are pursuing all-electric vehicles in an effort to meet increasingly stringent, government-mandated fleet emissions standards around the world. Honda has dedicated itself to reducing emissions for decades, so the company is able to take a different path.

A 2019 report from Environment & Climate Change Canada bears this out. Based on 2017 data, it identifies the Honda Canada fleet as having the best overall fuel economy in the industry, and lower-than-average CO2 emissions among ICE manufacturers.

At Honda, the focus is on the present and the future. For now, the goal is to continue to provide Canadians with vehicles that are well-engineered, fuel-efficient and fun to drive. No matter which model drives off the lot, it will be a leader in terms of its carbon footprint, without compromising on any of the other qualities for which Honda is renowned. Honda owners also have the comfort of knowing they’re taking steps toward reducing their own carbon footprint.

As for the future? As Honda pursues even greener numbers across the board, two-thirds of its global vehicle sales will be electrified by the year 2030. Some models will be electric vehicles (EVs), while others will be hybrids. Honda has the luxury of being able to take a measured approach to introducing next-generation electrified powertrains – putting them on the road only when they’re fully proven.

Even the best EVs demand some form of compromise. For certain all-electric vehicles, range is still a concern, higher price points are limiting, and there are the logistics of charging to consider. But when you’re behind the wheel of a hybrid engineered by a company with decades of experience in electrification, there is no compromise.

2020 Honda Clarity Plug-In Hybrid

A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), the Clarity can run solely on its gas engine or the electric motor, or a combination of the two. The hybrid powertrain produces a combined total of 212 horsepower, which allows for quick acceleration and seamless highway manoeuvres.

2020 Honda Accord Hybrid

The Accord Hybrid shines a spotlight on the third-generation version of Honda’s innovative two-motor hybrid powertrain. The result: a high-performing sedan that is also highly efficient. Drivers can leave all the heavy lifting to the Electric-Continuously Variable Transmission (E-CVT), which seamlessly manages the connection between the motors and the ICE. Or they can take control with one of three driver-selectable modes: Sport Drive, ECON or EV. The steering wheel-mounted deceleration paddles give the driver another measure of control, allowing him or her to adjust the rate or stopping power while simultaneously charging the battery. The Accord Hybrid is the no-compromises sport sedan that combines winning style and world-class performance.

These are confusing times. Consumers are bombarded with countless sources of information, and it’s difficult to sort out fact from fiction.

Honda Canada has responded with a clear and concise approach to communicating the environmental footprint of its vehicles. In an era of growing climate-change awareness, consumers and environmentalists want to know how the automotive industry is taking action, and confusion should not be an option when it comes time to make a purchase.

The new campaign, available to view at honda.ca, provides verified data on CO2 emissions for each model sold in Canada, and it gives consumers useful information on reducing their own carbon footprints. The campaign doesn’t just represent a return to the company’s roots, says Jean Marc Leclerc, senior vice-president of sales and marketing for Honda Canada – it’s a reaffirmation.

“A focus on fuel efficiency and using fewer resources has been part of our DNA for a long time,” he explains. “We have a history in this space, so we believe it’s our responsibility at Honda Canada to change the conversation, to get consumers thinking about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a different way.”

An industry first, the campaign builds on the most recent federal government GHG report, entitled Greenhouse Gas Emissions Performance for the 2017 Model Year Light-Duty Vehicle Fleet, published by Environment & Climate Change Canada last year. The report verifies that the Honda Canada fleet had the best overall fuel economy in the industry, and lower-than-average carbon emissions among internal combustion engine (ICE) manufacturers.

Based on the data, the Honda Canada website lists how many grams of CO2 its vehicles emit per kilometre. It’s a recognition by the company that environmental performance is a competitive advantage.

“The campaign follows the model the food industry used when it introduced calorie counts,” Leclerc says. “The automotive industry is far behind the food industry right now, but we can bridge the gap – it’s all about giving consumers what they need to make informed decisions.”

Visitors to the Honda Canada website can also make quick comparisons among models. For example, a shopper interested in a Honda Pilot because it suits their lifestyle may decide that they can make a Honda Civic work instead. “The core of the idea is to focus – or refocus – on reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” Leclerc says.

“Whether you’re driving an SUV with an internal combustion engine or a compact car or a hybrid, there are vehicles in every category that perform better than others. At Honda, we have some of the best performing vehicles in the business and we’re just reintroducing this to the Canadian consumer from a different perspective.”

The Honda Canada campaign, Driven to Reduce Emissions Since 1948, says its global organization plans for electric to represent two-thirds of its vehicle sales by 2030, an ambitious target that incorporates a measured approach to technological innovation. It aims to reduce carbon emissions across its business and manufacturing operations.

This focus on the environment also extends to a number of social causes in Canada, as one of four key pillars of the Honda Canada Foundation. Through the Foundation, Honda partners with charities that bring environmental education to classrooms and after-school programs across Canada.

The Foundation’s long-term partnership with Earth Rangers, a kids’ conservation organization, educates young people across the country about animals and the environment through the School Assembly Program, igniting a spark of enthusiasm that motivates children to start taking action to help protect the environment.

Concern for the environment is not new to Honda. In 1972, the company introduced the CVCC engine, the first to meet U.S. Clean Air Act standards without the need for a catalytic converter. And last year, it announced a long-term agreement to purchase renewable wind and solar power to cover more than 60 per cent of the company’s electricity requirements in North America.

All of Honda Canada’s decisions fall under the global “Blue Skies for Our Children” umbrella: a wide-ranging environmental directive to do what the company can to give future generations the opportunity to experience the joy and freedom of mobility while living in a sustainable society.

Corolla has been part of millions of Canadian lives for more than 50 years and is our all-time best-selling model. — Cyril Dimitris, vice president, Toyota Canada Inc.

Now in its 11th generation, the venerable Corolla model is one of the most iconic and popular compact cars in North America. And it is consistently one of the top-selling vehicles in Canada, accounting for about 1.5 million of the more than 40 million Corolla vehicles sold globally.

Open this photo in gallery The Corolla, now in its 11th generation, continues to draw attention and eyes.

“Corolla has been part of millions of Canadian lives for more than 50 years and is our all-time best-selling model,” said Cyril Dimitris, vice president, Toyota Canada Inc. “It’s sporty styling and handling make it fun-to-drive, while its state-of-the-art safety and legendary dependability and efficiency make it a pleasure to own.”

The Corolla has built a loyal fan-base of owners who keep returning to the brand year-after-year, thanks to things like reliability and handling, as well as first-time buyers attracted to the unique style, elaborate accents and standard safety equipment.

Margaret Schuler, of Belleville, Ontario, who now drives a Corolla, has kept coming back to Toyota.

“I’ve had a few Toyotas over the years, from the Tercel back in the 1980s to the Matrix in the 1990s, and I had a Corolla before this one too,” she explained.

“Nothing ever goes wrong with them, they are literally so reliable. The service is good too.”

She also likes the fact that the resale value holds up, due mostly to the reputation the brand carries, and the front and centre standard features included in the TSS system.

Open this photo in gallery It’s difficult to remember a Canadian road-trip when if you didn’t see a Toyota Corolla on the highway, then you were likely driving in one. Shown here is a 1969 model.

The Corolla also includes comfort and security innovations, such as the Display Audio system with SIRI Eyes-Free, Bluetooth connectivity and steering wheel-mounted controls. Then there’s the dual power adjustable seats (available on LE and SE grades only), heated exterior mirrors, power doors and windows, piano-black centre cluster accents, map lamps, and 12v power outlets for personal electronics. With cabin space for five people, the 2019 Toyota Corolla sedan is, as always, comfortable and safe, driven by the ever-reliable 1.8L four-cylinder engine that pushes a peak 132 horsepower which pops to 140 horsepower in the ECO LE model.

Strap either of those to the proven choice of manual transmission or the CVTi-S with sport mode, sequential shift mode and paddle shifters and you’re getting traction in the right direction.

A loyal fan, Ms. Schuler said when it’s time to trade-in her current Corolla, she’ll be returning to Toyota again, adding: “There are other compact cars which may look similar, but I don’t think they’re built as well as the Toyotas.”

A lot of people have been saying that for many years.

It’s why among the vehicles we love, the Corolla – always evolving – has a special place among Canadian drivers.

COURTESY OF GAIRLOCH DEVELOPMENTS

Low-rise and mid-rise projects allow different entry points for prospective home buyers to upsize or downsize

When considering buying a home in the Greater Toronto Area, you may want to consider a segment of the market known to developers and planners as the missing middle.

That’s the gap that exists between home types that are either single, detached houses or towering condos. It’s where semi-detached houses, townhomes, and low-rise and mid-rise buildings are choices for young adults seeking to grow a family or empty nesters who may want to downsize but stay in their neighbourhood.

Story continues below advertisement

The problem? Traditional zoning regulations and building policies in the GTA haven’t made it easy to build this kind of housing in the past, even though buyers are seeking it.

“Various folks have used the missing middle as a term in different contexts,” says Bill Gairdner, president of Gairloch Developments in Toronto. “It was meant to describe everything from semi-detached [homes] to townhomes to walk-up apartments to mid-rise, which would be the top of it.”

Rules created more than a century ago to prevent walk-up apartment buildings from encroaching on established residential neighbourhoods in Toronto have not kept pace with the times.

A National Housing Innovation Series hosted by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) and The Globe and Mail last year heard that moving just one per cent of single-family dwellings in Toronto to the “missing middle” segment would result in 44,000 new units, which would be the capacity of 140 new high-rises.

“The missing middle provides different entry points to upsize or downsize,” Gairdner says, who has a passion for creating mid-rise boutique projects in Toronto.

“The more supply that we can deliver in the development industry, the better chances we have to tackle the affordability issue.”

It’s not just the zoning regulations, but also a degree of NIMBY-ism (Not In My Backyard) attitudes in traditional neighbourhoods that prevents the missing middle housing stock to grow.

Story continues below advertisement

“My projects are in well-established neighbourhoods or ones that are up-and-coming,” Gairdner says. “You want to make it as easy as possible for developers to acquire land and build the kind of product that people want to live in.”

There are green shoots showing, however, as politicians and policy makers understand that a greater diversity of housing is needed to help Toronto and region advance in a way that expands affordability.

“Basically, you need strong progressive politicians who are confident enough to help advance reasonable mid-rise development, in spite of the fact that their constituents may be objecting to the change with typical NIMBY concerns,” Gairdner says.

American architect Daniel Parolek is credited with launching the term “missing middle” a decade ago. He described it as a range of multi-unit or clustered housing types compatible in scale with single-family homes that help meet the growing demand for walkable urban living.

Gairloch’s 1414 Bayview project is an eight-storey luxury condominium development in Toronto’s Leaside neighbourhood. One month into sales, 20 of the 44 units (one, two and three-bedroom suites with pricing from $650,000) had been sold.

The 1414 Bayview project was designed specifically to fit into the neighbourhood, Gairdner says, and it retains several rental units that expand affordability in accordance with city guidelines.

Another Gairloch condo project, the eight-storey, mid-rise Junction Point with 111 units at 2625 Dundas St. W. is scheduled to break ground in early 2021. Just north of High Park and 20 minutes from downtown, sales are expected to ramp up in September.

While the pandemic has made the sales process slower, prompting one-on-one appointments rather than big sales events, demand remains strong, Gairdner says.

When the Canadian Urban Institute and Evergreen Housing Action Lab examined missing middle housing in Toronto in 2017-18, the resulting report noted that, as rental housing is harder to find, and housing becomes more expensive, younger and middle-aged households have difficulty accessing the ownership market.

The report recommended options to add “gentle” density to Toronto’s neighbourhoods and consider zoning alternatives, as well as options to reduce development costs for mid-rise and other missing middle housing types.

More developers are beginning to add mid-rise development to their portfolios, Gairdner says. “It’s getting more competitive for the missing middle and there are fewer sites in Toronto, so now larger developers are taking on mid-rise projects, whereas before they’d look at the scale being too small.”

The missing middle housing segment is typically not attractive to foreign investors, who might otherwise buy units as investments and hold them or rent them out from afar.

The pandemic has shone a light on urban density, prompting questions about whether now is the time to trade big city living for more wide-open spaces.

“I can see the logic of wanting to escape to the country, but there is the commute situation and you’re still dealing with trains or subway or cars, so there is no silver bullet,” Gairdner says.

“Our business model aligns well with having larger, more customizable units without sharing an elevator with hundreds of people or having six levels of underground parking.”

Looking beyond the city, the 130-home Riverside Estates project by Ambria Homes, situated in the Peterborough area along the picturesque Otonabee River, gives the nod to living in wider spaces. The distance between Toronto and Peterborough is 137 km.

“The project has walking trails, a boat launch, ponds and it’s on the river, so it is a good combination of estate homes and nature,” says Lily Lancia, a management executive at Ambria Homes.

“You can feel like you are part of the landscape.”

Both first-time home buyers and retirees are looking to enjoy a lifestyle beside a river, she says. The pedestrian walkways wind past green spaces and ponds with places to relax and just soak up being in nature.

Trent University, Fleming College and Trillium College are all nearby, as are a full range of education choices in Peterborough.

“People are willing to go a little farther beyond the city for nature, especially given that Highway 407 has been extended and the project is really not that far from Toronto,” Lancia says.

“With millennials waiting longer to have kids, many are turning to pet parenting, which we’re now seeing is having a major impact on their home-buying decisions,” says Debbie Soon, head of Rover Canada. “We’ve found that 42 per cent of pet parents factor their pets into their home-buying decisions and, with pet ownership growing in Toronto, we only anticipate that number to grow.”

Also according to the study, 40 per cent said pets affect their decisions when it comes to buying a car, and 37 per cent when choosing furniture.

According to Statista, the pet food market in Canada is worth approximately $1.9-billion. The Canadian Animal Health Institute said there were 8.2 million dogs and 8.3 million cats in Canadian households in 2018, with 41 per cent of households having at least one dog and 38 per cent having at least one cat. For developers, that means accommodating pet owners is top of mind.

At Riverbend Estates, a project by Ambria Homes in Peterborough that features grand country manors, homes come with large 70-foot lots. Ponds and walkways are designed in a natural way within the community site plan, creating countless opportunities to enjoy pet-friendly outdoor living.

Accommodating pets is also very much the focus for Menkes Developments through their various projects in and around Toronto, says Mimi Ng, senior vice-president of residential sales and marketing.

“We don’t actively track the number of buyers with pets, but anecdotally I can definitely say that we have noticed an increased number of purchaser enquiries about pet facilities and policies or rules around pets in our projects,” she says.

“Generally speaking, Toronto condo developers have become more cognizant of pet ownership and many are incorporating pet-friendly features and spaces in the design of indoor and outdoor amenity areas.”

Specifically, with their earlier projects, Menkes built basic pet-washing stations, usually situated near the building entrance, so residents could rinse off their dog’s paws.

“Our current projects build on that, with expanded pet-washing facilities, which would be appreciated by anyone who has ever tried bathing a large dog in a condo,” Ng adds, “as well as outdoor dog runs and play spaces.”

In their upcoming Festival condominium community in Vaughan Metropolitan Centre (VMC), there will be a dog park on the outdoor terrace, with play areas and a dog relief zone complete with a fake fire hydrant and drainage infrastructure.

Like with the numerous dog parks that have become such an integral part of downtown Toronto living, these will no doubt become popular places for residents of the building and help to foster a sense of community.

In the end, with these types of amenities, not only will the pets be thankful, but the pet owners will likely be thanking developers as well.

While the economy has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, realtors have been seeing activity return and say the real estate market might rebound much faster than anticipated

The real estate market in the Greater Toronto Area was red-hot at the start of the year, with a low interest rate environment and strong employment growth.

Then, of course, COVID-19 came along and shattered those prospects.

Story continues below advertisement

With mandated business closures and a loss of consumer confidence, The Conference Board of Canada expects to see an 8.2 per cent contraction of the Canadian economy this year – the worst annual contraction on record – according to its Canadian Outlook Summary: Summer 2020.

The think tank also forecasts a decline of 11 per cent in the average home price between the first and third quarters of this year.

But it’s not all bad news: The Conference Board expects the economy will rebound by 6.7 per cent in 2021 and 4.8 per cent in 2022, depending on how well the post-COVID recovery is managed and if there’s a second wave severe enough to shut down the economy again.

“There are a lot of unknowns floating around out there,” says Robin Wiebe, the board’s chief economist. “The question is how is employment going to recover, because employment is critical to the housing market.”

Another factor is the desirability of living downtown, after this period of residents being cooped up in condos with lack of green space. It’s the “topic du jour,” Wiebe says, because several companies have decided to permanently scrap the office, so employees might now consider moving to a larger property outside of the GTA.

But Toronto has experienced rapid population growth in recent years, so there’s also pent-up demand.

“Once COVID-19 is past and hopefully most people are back to work, the underlying demographics are favourable,” Wiebe says. “Toronto is not overbuilt by any stretch.”

This is also what realtors are seeing on the ground. “We’ve already seen a dramatic uptick in national activity in May and June, and we expect this trend to continue through the summer,” says Christopher Alexander, executive vice-president and regional director with RE/MAX of Ontario-Atlantic Canada.

“We credit this to the pre-existing pent-up demand for homes in hot markets such as Vancouver, Toronto and Ottawa, which helped mitigate the decline in transactions that were paused due to the pandemic.”

The Canadian market saw a steep year-over-year decline in the volume of transactions during the peak of COVID-19, according to data from RE/MAX Canada.

However, exceptionally low inventory in much of Canada has been a key factor in price stability throughout the pandemic, Alexander says, and will likely result in continued upward price pressure as restrictions ease and demand increases further.

“We’re already seeing a return to pre-pandemic activity – and then some – with multiple-offer scenarios in markets like Toronto, Ottawa and Vancouver. This indicates to us that markets could improve much faster than we initially anticipated at the beginning of COVID-19,” Alexander says.

According to a Leger survey conducted on behalf of RE/MAX Canada, 56 per cent of Canadians planning to engage in the real estate market expect to do so in less than a year.

While sales volumes have declined, prices have held, says Jared Menkes, executive vice-president of high-rise residential with Menkes Developments. “We are seeing signs of pent-up demand and positive sentiments among buyers, with the number of inquiries and people resuming their housing research growing every week.”

Although COVID-19 has put a pause on peoples’ lives, “their changing housing needs don’t just go away,” Menkes says.

“People are still getting engaged, having babies or wanting to move out from their family homes. If anything, being at home during COVID has caused many households to re-evaluate their space needs and made them realize that they do need to upsize or upgrade their existing home.”

Indeed, more people are looking for “vacation-like properties,” he says, and there has been a surge in demand for homes that have active areas and green spaces. That has been a key focus for Menkes for some time now – certainly before the pandemic.

“Sugar Wharf is a perfect example of a project that was developed with a resort-like theme, aimed at offering future residents a wide range of outdoor amenities, plus the development includes a new two-acre community park,” Menkes says.

The developer has continued this focus with its Mobilio project located in Vaughan. Aside from the outdoor spaces it’s creating within the development, the site will also be anchored by a linear park, part of Vaughan’s Black Creek renewal project. Once completed, it will establish a series of promenades and parks that span more than 30 acres.

“While we aim to incorporate these aspects into the development and design of our projects, we also look at what the surrounding area will offer,” Menkes says. For example, with a project like Sugar Wharf, residents will also have easy access to the Toronto waterfront and islands.

Shane Baghai, president of Baghai Developments, is also seeing the market start to pick up, after delays related to shipping and new construction protocols.

“COVID really did a number on builders,” he says. “Now things are starting to move and I see vibrancy in the city.”

Indeed, as far as the market is concerned, “it’s almost as buoyant and active as before, in some cases even more so.”

With first-time buyers, “condo sales have probably dropped marginally,” Baghai says, but there’s demand for two- and three-bedroom condos, particularly if those condo units have large balconies or terraces. Leaside Manor, for example, is well-suited to meet this demand with spacious two- and three-bedroom suites plus den.

“We’ve been pleasantly surprised – we’ve got a ton of interest,” says Bill Gairdner, founder and president of Gairloch Developments, which launched its eight-storey development at 1414 Bayview at the start of June. “We’re at 35 per cent sold, so that was really positive considering there was no launch event or flashy festivities.”

Like other Menkes developments, Festival offers residents essential connection to nature. Homes that offer green space have been a focus for Menkes even before the era of COVID-19. COURTESY OF MENKES DEVELOPMENTS

Launching in June was “somewhat of a risky move,” Gairdner says. “The vast majority of developers I know have all deferred to the fall with the idea that the fall will be a new world order.”

But he says there’s not a lot of product like 1414 Bayview in the Leaside neighbourhood, “so there’s pent-up demand,” he says.

“So it’s not reflective of the whole market. I don’t think it’s indicative of how condos are doing industry-wide. Our business model is well aligned with COVID or post-COVID.”

The condominium has only 44 units, many with generous private terraces and fewer communal spaces or shared amenities that tenants may be reluctant to use, especially if there’s a second wave of COVID-19 in the fall. At the same time, buyers want to make sure they have access to outdoor spaces.

“The neighbourhood itself is the amenity: the Don Valley trails, the Mount Pleasant Cemetery, the retail strip up and down Bayview,” Gairdner says.

“None of our projects have been too focused on saunas or spas or pools. It’s all very understated, more boutique style.”

RE/MAX expects to see relative price stability by the end of 2020, with a possible price correction in the single digits.

“That said, due to the high degree of uncertainty around the pandemic and a possible second wave in the fall, it’s difficult to predict beyond 2020 at this time,” Alexander says.

“If the first wave of COVID-19 has taught us anything, it’s to expect the unexpected and be prepared to pivot.”

For financial advisors and investors, the past decade has been about adjusting to the ‘new normal’ in portfolio construction.

Facing lower yields from fixed income, many portfolios have undergone a facelift as investors looking for greater returns jumped from safe, low-return, fixed-income instruments to riskier, higher-yielding bonds or dividend-paying stocks.

“The fixed-income portion of the portfolio has become much more complicated – to say the least,” says Ahmed Farooq, vice-president of exchange-traded fund (ETF) business development at Franklin Templeton Investments in Toronto.

Story continues below advertisement

Even for advisors, building this life preserver part of the portfolio has been challenging, particularly when it comes to convincing clients they need fixed income after more than a decade of rising equity markets and morose bond returns.

“It’s not an easy game,” says Edward Jong, a fixed-income portfolio manager with T.I.P. Wealth Manager Inc. in Toronto.

He notes among the challenges for fixed income is the low return environment globally, in which European and other nations have issued more than $11-trillion in bonds with negative yields.

“If rates are kept low, where does one look to generate extra income?” Mr. Jong asks.

Traditional portfolio construction is “predicated heavily on modern portfolio theory and the advantages of diversification” and does not necessarily work like it did more than a decade ago, says David Andrews, vice-president and client portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Investments in Toronto.

The diversification and risk-reducing benefit of adding bonds to equities has weakened. That means investors will need to start considering their options when seeking the safety cushion fixed-income investments provide.

While Canadian and U.S. fixed-income yields aren’t yet negative, they’re still losing propositions after inflation and taxation.

Story continues below advertisement

However, a strong argument can be made that investors’ portfolios need greater exposure to fixed income today more than ever. As Mr. Farooq notes, it’s more than likely many portfolios are out of balance from their original investment goals.

“In the 10 years of this reigning bull market, a lot of investors lost focus on the fixed-income exposure just because equities were up,” he says.

Moreover, if investors were buying fixed income, it was often “higher-octane” bonds, Mr. Farooq adds.

Most advisors acknowledge fixed income’s value as a portfolio cushion, padding against equities’ downside; driving that point home to clients is another matter, though.

“You have to do a lot of education,” says Adrian Mastracci, discretionary portfolio manager at Lycos Asset Management Inc. in Vancouver.

Specifically, he says he must explain to clients often that fixed income is necessary, albeit bitter, medicine for long-term portfolio health.

Story continues below advertisement

“Sometimes, when you look at the [fixed-income] returns you just have to hold your breath and carry on. That’s what I tell my clients,” he says.

Mr. Mastracci uses several portfolio management tools to get better fixed-income exposure, including individual bonds, guaranteed investment certificates and ETFs.

But it’s ETFs that have been a game-changer for bond investing in the past decade, with investors happy to take what a low-cost, diversified passive strategy gives them.

While that’s worked well over the past 10 years, a passive strategy may not be as rewarding over the next decade, Mr. Andrews says.

For example, a Canadian bond ETF that tracks a benchmark index by design will be affected, inevitably, by Canada’s large energy sector, which remains mired in a slump. That may pose more risk than advisors and investors are comfortable with going forward.

That’s where a new breed of ETFs may prove their worth. They’re actively managed with low management expense ratios (MERs) that look beyond traditional ETF investing.

Story continues below advertisement

Active ETFs start by tracking a benchmark index and a portfolio manager has the flexibility to deviate from the designated index or sector allocations to achieve alpha – better returns – based on their analysis.

These fund managers have the greenlight to adjust their portfolios tactically in response to events such as monetary policy changes, geopolitical events, interest rate changes or more – all of which can make fixed-income investments tougher to navigate.

Truly active portfolio managers also have the tools and the research capabilities to select bonds properly in an effort to help deliver better investor outcomes, while a passive portfolio manager has to match the fundamentals of the benchmark index.

This new generation of ETFs might involve, for example, providing broad exposure to Canadian government and blue-chip corporate bonds while leaving a significant allocation – say, up to 30 per cent of the portfolio – “designed to fill gaps that are not fulfilled in the Canadian bond marketplace … with investments that are off the Canadian benchmark,” Mr. Andrews explains.

That allocation might include high-yield U.S. bonds and short-term bank loans to generate a positive real return in the fixed-income allocation of the portfolio, he adds.

Or, an actively managed global bond ETF might still be “benchmark aware” providing, for example, diversified exposure based on the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index, but with a “fundamental screen on top,” Mr. Farooq says.

Story continues below advertisement

As such, the fund manager can underweight geographical allocations on the benchmark, which have negative yields and instead overweight “other countries with a positive outlook,” he says.

Also noteworthy is that actively managed ETFs can come with management fees that are competitive with those of passive products.

“It’s never been cheaper to get diversified exposure to bonds in the portfolio,” Mr. Andrews adds.

Put another way, advisors and even do-it-yourself investors don’t have to go it alone constructing the fixed-income portion of the portfolio unless, of course, they want to.

“For the most part, advisors are more comfortable with the equity side of the equation but some less comfortable managing the uncertainty we have with fixed-income market going forward,” Mr. Andrews says.

‘Smart beta’ has emerged as the next stage of advancement for investors and financial advisors interested in diversified, low-cost equity exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have performed swimmingly during the past decade thanks to the U.S. bull market’s rising tide.

Smart beta ETFs screen investments for factors beyond market-capitalization weightings associated with traditional ETFs – and they’re becoming increasingly popular.

According to ETF.com, more than 1,000 smart beta ETFs now trade on North American stock markets, including 95 that were launched last year. Investors have poured more than US$1-trillion into the category.

Story continues below advertisement

Todd Mathias, certified financial analyst, vice-president–senior ETF product strategist at Franklin Templeton Investments in San Mateo, Calif., says their popularity is driven in part by investment advisors, who are increasingly wary of clients’ overexposure to broad-based indexes like the S&P 500.

“Many [advisors] tell me they have been worried about this for a few years, and it only becomes more top of mind when you look at the current multiples [in stock prices],” he says.

Thus, advisors are looking to smart beta strategies as a way to moderate risk while providing some form of protection if the market reverses quickly.

“Smart beta rewrites the traditional index rulebook, which weights and invests by the size of the company’s security,” Mr. Mathias says.

In contrast, smart beta’s factor-based index approach employs research-driven strategies to screen stocks for an ETF portfolio.

Typically, these screens encompass one of five strategies: quality (companies with good earnings growth), value (firms that are undervalued), momentum (stocks that have stronger recent price appreciation), low volatility (companies with lower risk than the market) and dividend (those firms paying out higher dividends than average).

In the past couple of years, the low-volatility subcategory has been especially popular, according to National Bank of Canada Financial Inc., which tracks ETFs.

Story continues below advertisement

The firm reports it has seen waves of inflows into smart beta ETFs. In 2019 alone, low-volatility ETFs attracted $2.5-billion in Canada, and much of this inflow came in the aftermath of the U.S. market selloff in late 2018.

Open this photo in gallery Todd Mathias, vice-president–senior ETF product strategist, Franklin Templeton Investments SUPPLIED

Mr. Mathias points to the past year as an example. In the first six months of 2019, a low-volatility smart beta ETF would have outperformed the market. The second half of the year was a different story, though, with the strategy lagging behind the S&P 500 by about 8 per cent.

Due to the cyclical nature of each smart beta strategy, investors face the challenge of selecting the right factor to not only match current market conditions but future ones, too. Essentially, advisors run the risk of picking the wrong ETF at the wrong time.

The industry has moved to address this by creating multi-factor smart beta ETFs.

Mr. Mathias says these multi-factor ETF strategies essentially give investors another layer of diversification, providing exposure to several factors at once in one low-cost, liquid portfolio.

“By combining these factors thoughtfully, you can enhance returns and reduce risk, while still keeping clients invested in equity markets,” he says.

Mr. Mathias says Franklin Templeton offers four multi-factor ETFs in its suite of ETFs in Canada. Among them is Franklin LibertyQT U.S. Equity Index ETF (FLUS), which has attracted more than $240-million in client assets since its 2017 launch in Canada.

FLUS utilizes a rules-based approach to select U.S. stocks, which have favourable exposure to four factors and strategically weighted: quality at 50 per cent, value at 30 per cent, momentum at 10 per cent and low volatility also at 10 per cent.

Mr. Mathias says Franklin Templeton’s smart beta offerings are not designed to capture all the upside of the broader markets. Rather, multi-factor ETFs seek to mitigate downside risk while capturing a substantial portion of the upside in the market.

Open this photo in gallery Jeremy Olen, chief investment officer, The Financial Services Network SUPPLIED

This emphasis on quality resonates with many advisors, he adds. Among them is Azeem Virjee, senior investment advisor and portfolio manager at Wellington-Altus Private Wealth Inc. in Calgary, who says “traditional portfolio construction” presents challenges because “market capitalization is based on two key assumptions:” markets are efficient and investors are rational. “In reality, [neither] is often not the case.”

Mr. Virjee adds that a single-beta approach, while useful at times, is not as desirable as a multi-factor ETF, which “helps smooth out returns” over time.

By design, multi-factor ETFs reduce the depth of market dips, which in turn helps keep clients happy, Mr. Mathias says.

Story continues below advertisement

“The strategy is basically saying, ‘I believe value, quality, momentum and low volatility are strategies worth investing in, but I don’t want to be on the wrong side with a strategy losing money one to two years,’” he explains. “So, by blending all these factors together in one product, I’m getting the best of all worlds.”

Jeremy Olen, chief investment officer at The Financial Services Network in Sacramento, Calif., which provides investing and portfolio consulting services to independent advisors, points out that multi-factor ETFs are ideal for expressing long-term market views in a client portfolio “in a low-cost, tax efficient manner.”

They often have low management expense ratios and because they offer exposure to several factors, advisors don’t have to trade in and out of single-factor ETFs to adjust to market conditions, which would otherwise increase trading costs and potentially lead to realized, taxable capital gains, he says.

Q&A with Paul MacDonald, CFA Chief Investment officer and portfolio manager, Harvest Portfolios Group Inc.

The healthcare sector rebounded strongly at the end of the year despite a weak start to 2019. That momentum should carry through in 2020, says Paul MacDonald, chief investment officer at Harvest Portfolio Group.

In an interview, Mr. MacDonald talked about the philosophy behind the Harvest Healthcare Leaders Income ETF (TSX: HHL, HHL.U), the long term energizers driving healthcare stocks and why the sector will continue to perform regardless of U.S. election year anxiety.

What do you see for the healthcare sector in 2020 and beyond?

Story continues below advertisement

Over the medium to longer term, the healthcare sector has several themes. The first is aging populations. The second is technological innovation in medical devices, equipment and drugs. The third is rising demand in emerging markets. These are permanent and noncyclical forces, so we want to be positioned there.

In the shorter-term, we see attractive valuations, though U.S. political noise will continue this year. But over the past three or four months there has been a positive shift in the sentiment towards the sector. It has been a noticeable change.

What were the surprises in 2019?

Healthcare was the second worst performing S&P sector behind energy. What drove that? In part the extreme views and rhetoric as the Democratic primaries came into focus early in the year. The talk about socializing the system worried some investors.

You could see that impact when it came to quarterly earnings. The stocks of companies with strong earnings and guidance would struggle to rally. If they missed earnings it was a very painful experience.

But as the year went on there was a shift. Companies were rewarded again for robust earnings. So, when I look at 2020, I think you have an environment where valuations are discounted, sentiment is improving and some of that extreme rhetoric has subsided. Policies are coming much closer to centre. When you put that together, we see an incredible longer-term opportunity.

How should investors approach the sector?

Story continues below advertisement

Our message to advisers is that if you want healthcare and income that’s what our fund is all about. If you want healthcare exposure you want to own a basket.

Medtech has been the shining star for several years and on the flip side, biotech has underperformed. Large cap biotech companies have been under pressure for the past 12 to 18 months. Even for hundred-billion-dollar market capitalization companies, a momentum shift can move share prices by 30 per cent in a very short span.

Medical technology companies have shown a clear growth picture. So, they’ve been afforded much higher multiples. Perhaps this is because they’re perceived to have less exposure to some of the political narrative. That trend could continue.

We want to be in those types of companies as a group. Any individual name, say Johnson & Johnson, a $375-billion company, can move 15 per cent up or down based on whether it’s the news, or there have been disappointing drug trials, political noise or the threat of lawsuits.

So, for us, diversity across the subsectors is key, being exposed to all areas including med techs, pharmaceuticals, biopharmaceuticals and managed care such as insurance.

How much will U.S. politics affect things in 2020?

We are likely to have rhetoric all year, but does the market look beyond it? It would seem to me that it is starting to do that.

What we saw in early 2019 is actually what I would’ve expected in early 2020. But as you peel back the layers of the system, you realize it is extraordinarily difficult to effect change.

There are numerous vested parties, whether it’s the manufacturers, distributors, whether it’s the insurance companies. There’s always going to be resistance to radical change.

Tell us about the Harvest Healthcare Leaders Income ETF

We have a very simple process to narrow down the universe of 3,000 companies to about 75. We require a minimum market capitalization of $10-billion. They have to be North American listed and have to have options trading so we can take advantage of our covered call strategy. The covered call strategy generates income by foregoing a little bit of the upside.

From the 75 companies we select 20, filtering for things like earnings, return on equity, cash flow metrics and balance sheet metrics. We look at it as a healthcare pie and want to make sure we have exposure to each one of the pieces: medtech, biotech, services, insurance and make sure we are not overexposed to any one area. We want to be diversified.

As at December 31, 2019, 42 per cent of the ETFs holdings are in pharmaceuticals, 20 per cent in biotechnology, 19 per cent in healthcare equipment and supplies and 16 per cent are healthcare providers.

How has the ETF performed?

The ETF posted a positive return in 2019 in a very volatile market. We’ve continued to generate growth and income. Even though healthcare was the second worst performing subsector behind energy in the S&P 500, we’re still up double digits for the year.

Do you have any final comments?

We are later cycle now. It is definitely the time to be invested in good quality businesses. That should always be the case, but even more so now.

We think that healthcare is an opportunity for those that can look beyond macro noise. It has defensive characteristics; good dividend yields and valuations that are at discounts to the broader market.

With Canadians facing slow growth in the economy at home, mild economic growth globally and continued low interest rates, it will be a challenge for financial advisors and investors alike to eke out decent fixed-income returns in their portfolios, investment experts warns.

In fact, Franklin Templeton Investments Corp.’s 2020 Capital Market Expectations report predicts that fixed-income returns on global government and corporate bonds will lag past rates of return.

That means advisors and investors will have to get creative when it comes to fixed-income investing and consider how to use active and passive investing strategies to make up the difference.

Darcy Briggs, senior vice-president, portfolio manager with Franklin Bissett Investment Management in Calgary, says the best strategy is to be nimble and cast a wide net for returns.

“Going into 2020, [interest] rates are relatively low, credit spreads are pretty tight and we are in a low-volatility environment,” he says. “This is a very unusual environment, it doesn’t happen very often.”

Dan Hallett, vice-president and principal at Oakville, Ont.-based Highview Financial Group worries that the extended bull market has “blinded investors to the risks they’re taking” when they allocate more of their investments to higher-returning equities and away from fixed-income.

Thus, he suggests investors stick with a traditional portfolio mix of 60 per cent equities and 40 per cent fixed income rather than abandoning the latter, which is risky.

“Generally speaking, investors’ bond allocations should largely stay intact,” Mr. Hallett argues. “Emphasizing high-quality corporate bonds can add a bit of extra yield [and] any reduction of bonds to redirect money to higher-returning assets should be done modestly.”

Yet, Mr. Briggs says his firm is cautious when approaching fixed-income investments in the current environment. Rather than looking for home runs or taking bold positioning, he says Franklin Bissett is “looking to play a little more defence and hit singles.”

That includes using multiple levers to generate returns in the current environment, one of which is investing in selective “fallen angels” – or using extensive credit analysis to buy debt opportunistically in companies that have been downgraded due to a weakened financial position.

Mr. Briggs provides the example of Cenovus Energy Inc., which lost its investment-grade status for a time in 2016.

“A number of investors can’t hold subinvestment-grade [debt],” he says. “So, we are monitoring these types of securities for potential opportunities”

Mr. Briggs expects similar buying opportunities may arise this year as the trend among public companies of late has been to increase leverage for numerous reasons, one of which was for share repurchases. The current environment has created conditions for overall credit ratings to migrate downward, generally, given company fundamentals at the current stage of the credit cycle.

“There comes a time that if global economic activity doesn’t pick up, some of these companies actually trip, which may create conditions leading to a credit rating downgrade to junk,” he says

The dividing line between “junk” and investment-grade bonds can create the potential of superior returns, he notes. One recent example he cites is supermarket operator Sobeys Inc., which dipped below investment-grade status before improving its operations.

Mr. Briggs also looks beyond Canada’s narrow fixed-income market as 85 per cent of it comprises of government bonds and debt issued by financial service firms.

He believes that investors have no choice but to embrace an active investment strategy to generate fixed-income returns in a low interest rate environment.

“We can dissect the multiple risks that we see, selecting those with better risk-return potential and move portfolio positioning to capitalize in order to generate excess benchmark returns,” he says. “With a passive strategy, you don’t even get benchmark returns. You get benchmark minus [management expense ratio] returns.”

The risks associated with a passive approach to fixed-income investing “have gone way up,” says Yves Rebetez, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) analyst and chief investment officer at Pascal Financial in Toronto.

That’s in large part because investors are assuming more duration risk as the average term periods of debt held within fixed-income ETFs is lengthening and making investors potentially more vulnerable to interest-rate changes.

Mr. Rebetez sees the appeal for investors to have a fund manager adjusting for credit and duration risk rather than taking a passive approach to fixed-income investing. “The problem is I am not sure I even want to be in that space because of low returns.”

However, lower bond returns are still better than returns generated by holding cash or cash equivalents, Mr. Briggs says.

Story continues below advertisement

While some wary investors have retreated to holding more cash in money market funds or ultra-safe, locked-in investments, such as guaranteed investment certificates (GICs), he worries that strategy is setting them up for disappointment.

“In 2018, cash was the best performing asset, but it was the best performing asset for the first time in 20 years. In 2019, it was the worst performing asset. It lagged fixed income and it really lagged equities,” he says.

As for holding GICs, except for those that are cashable, “you’re locked in with zero liquidity. It is a trade-off for safety but if it allows some investors to sleep better it is understandable,” he adds.

For investors looking for better fixed-income returns and liquidity than those offered by GICs but with more safety than a pure fixed-income fund, a short-duration bond fund, which invests in debt of two to three years, on average, is a good option, Mr. Briggs suggests.

“You are able to get better than cash returns,” he says. “It kind of wedges in between a pure no-risk GIC and a bond fund return. You don’t have a lot of volatility, generally, with a short duration bond fund.”

SUPPLIED

Financial advisors and investors will likely have to take on more risk in their investment portfolios in the coming decade if they want to achieve the rates of return they have been accustomed to over the past 20 years.

That’s because the annual returns in a range of asset classes that are core to Canadian portfolios – including Canadian equities, government and investment-grade bonds – are projected to be lower over the next seven to 10 years, according to money managers at Franklin Templeton Investments Corp. They presented some of the key insights from the firm’s Capital Market Expectations report at its 2020 Global Investment Outlook event in Toronto last month.

To produce the report, the firm examined the expected rates of returns of more than 50 asset classes by looking closely at a variety of factors, from historical risk premia, economic growth and inflation prospects to debt levels, populism and how policy-makers are expected to respond to the next economic downturn.

Notably, Franklin Templeton predicts that Canadian government and investment-grade corporate bonds will lag past rates of return dramatically. That means advisors and investors will likely have to adopt a more aggressive asset mix to meet their goals, said William Yun, the firm’s executive vice-president of multi-asset solutions in New York, at the event.

“If you are looking just at your typical 60-40 equities-fixed income portfolio, you may not be able to achieve your required rates of return,” he warned, noting that such an asset mix would only produce returns of slightly more than 4 per cent.

Thus, he recommended that advisors and investors adopt a “multi-faceted approach” to achieve better returns.

“There are different asset classes, different ways to achieve a return for clients that meet their risk objectives rather than just staying with Canadian equities and Canadian fixed-income,” Mr. Yun said.

That means adding more U.S., international and emerging-markets equities and corporate bonds, and even more alternative assets, such as hedge funds, to the mix.

He notes that the asset mix “depends on each investor, their risk tolerance and time horizon. But, in general, in this low inflationary environment … you may have to consider alternative asset classes.”

As such, advisors and investors might consider other non-traditional assets, such as real estate, to produce superior returns.

Franklin Templeton’s outlook predicts that “the global economic environment will be supportive of risk assets” over the next seven years, which should help those advisors and investors who adopt a more diversified and multi-asset portfolio.

Overall, the firm predicts moderate global growth with low inflation, but more near-term volatility.

The firm remains positive on emerging markets, noting that growth potential should lead to outperformance over developed-market equities and bonds.

In developed markets, Franklin Templeton expects that equities have greater performance potential than bonds.

Specifically, the firm is overweight on U.S. equities, based on the ability of the U.S. central bank to cut interest rates further if required and a resurgent U.S. consumer, who is enjoying higher wages and employment, and a rising net worth.

Mr. Yun noted that U.S. retail sales are “very strong and if you have even a mildly confident consumer that is spending in the U.S. – where consumption is about two-thirds of the economy – that is another positive sign in terms of its economic outlook.”

As for north of the border, Franklin Templeton money managers recommend investors underweight Canadian equities in the coming year, and they hold a neutral approach to Canadian government and investment-grade bonds.

“We have a fairly cautious view on the Canadian economy given some of the cyclical and structural challenges,” said Ian Riach, Toronto-based senior vice-president and portfolio manager, Franklin Templeton multi-asset solutions, at the event.

He pointed to rising manufacturing inventories and declining capital investments and corporate profits, plus a heavily indebted Canadian consumer, who may be running out of borrowing capacity.

It’s estimated that Canadians currently owe $1.75 for every dollar in income that they generate, almost double the 90 cents owed per dollar earned in 1990. By comparison, U.S. consumers have cut their debt since the recession of a decade ago and are in better shape financially.

“With consumer debt at high levels and maybe the negative implications that it can have for banks, and challenges within the resource sectors, the Canadian economy is vulnerable,” Mr. Riach said.

That includes not just the energy industry, but also the mining and forestry industries, which face challenges because of trade disputes and a global slowdown.

Story continues below advertisement

He noted that corporate fundamentals in the form of profit margins and earnings per share are “not dire but are weakening,” while there are policy hurdles to foreign investment in the form of perceived high business tax rates and excessive bureaucracy in Canada.

Canadian equities are priced “fairly attractively” compared with those in the U.S. and their long-term averages, but Mr. Riach is not recommending a buying spree, noting that markets can stay undervalued for long periods.

“Despite valuations being very attractive, we think Canadian equities are vulnerable to further disappointment,” he said.

Franklin Templeton’s analysts are also downplaying the possibility of a recession this year, putting the odds at just 20 per cent, stating that it would take an extraordinary shock to the economic system to cause a downturn.

Newly elected Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole spent the first two days of his leadership declaring his party’s openness and shaking off any notion that he might be a social conservative: He is pro-choice and supports gay marriage.

Mr. O’Toole held his first news conference as Conservative Leader on Tuesday where he spoke again about welcoming people to his party. He repeated part of his victory speech, delivered around 1 a.m. Monday, saying that people from any race or creed, LGBTQ or straight, Indigenous or new to Canada, and from any faith “have a home” in the Conservative Party. However, Mr. O’Toole still faced questions about social conservatives and abortion at his news conference.

“I have a clear track record on standing up for human rights whether it’s women, whether it’s the LGBT community. I won the leadership of the Conservative Party as a pro-choice Conservative MP, one that won with a strong mandate. That’s how I’m going to lead as the Leader of the Opposition and that’s how I will be as Prime Minister,” Mr. O’Toole told reporters. During the previous federal election, then-Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said he was personally against abortion, after dodging the question for weeks.

Mr. O’Toole won the leadership in the third round of balloting after securing the ranked-ballot votes of many supporters of Leslyn Lewis, a Toronto lawyer and social conservative who placed third in the race. Former cabinet minister Peter MacKay placed second and Conservative MP Derek Sloan, also a social conservative, was fourth.

Conservative strategist Kate Harrison, the vice-president of Summa Strategies and a former political staffer, said Tuesday that Mr. O’Toole’s initial remarks as leader have been a deliberate attempt to shift the tone of how Conservatives may be perceived by the broader public.

“I think that he wants Canadians to know that there is a Conservative alternative and a Conservative vision that doesn’t leave people out in the cold, particularly at a time when people need help and support, but that this Conservative Party under his leadership would be one that would be a bit more forward thinking, a bit more visionary in its plan and trying to be more inclusive,” she said.

When asked if he felt he owed social conservatives anything because he gained some of their support, Mr. O’Toole said he will “treat all of our members with respect” and repeated that he was elected as a pro-choice MP.

Jack Fonseca, political operations director for Campaign Life Coalition, said his organization knew where Mr. O’Toole stood on abortion and so it recommended its supporters rank Ms. Lewis and Mr. Sloan as their top choices, and avoid ranking Mr. O’Toole or Mr. MacKay at all. However, he said, Mr. O’Toole would not have won without the support of social conservatives, adding he will also need their support to win the federal election.

“I think he would be very foolish, especially two days after seeing the influence and strength of the social conservatives that are his natural base, to offer them nothing. … They need something to chew on,” Mr. Fonseca said.

Mr. O’Toole skirted a question about whether his leadership rival Mr. Sloan should be expelled from caucus for comments he made during the leadership race.

In a statement on Tuesday, Liberal MP Pam Damoff urged Mr. O’Toole to remove Mr. Sloan from the Conservative caucus. “Mr. O’Toole has an important decision to make, which will help Canadians understand his vision for the future of our country: He can stand up for the rights of all Canadians, or he can condone racism, misogyny and bigotry within his own caucus,” Ms. Damoff said.

In April, Mr. Sloan refused to apologize after questioning Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam’s loyalty to the country, asking in a Facebook video: “Does she work for Canada or for China?” He later said his comments were “deliberately” mischaracterized by the Liberals.

Mr. O’Toole said there’s always pressure and contrasting ideas in leadership campaigns but now the race is over.

“I received a clear mandate and I’m very excited to meet with my caucus and talk with all of them about uniting, and going forward together, and I’ll be doing that in the coming days and weeks,” he said.

Mr. O’Toole also laid out some of his priorities, saying that as prime minister he would lead a government that rebuilds the economy and creates long-term jobs with ambitious projects. He said he will propose programs that will make it easier for people to “get ahead” and also spoke about national unity and the need to support the resources sector to alleviate the feeling of alienation in Western Canada.

He also said that his party will be tough on China: “We will trade freely with free nations and not spend our time chasing trade deals with predatory countries like Communist China.”

The new leader could find himself running to become prime minister in a matter of months – if not weeks. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last week requested a prorogation of Parliament until late September. When it returns a Throne Speech will trigger a confidence vote, and, depending on the outcome, possibly a general election.

Mr. O’Toole would not say how he intends to vote on the Throne Speech, saying it will be discussed in the future. However, he said because of that, he may soon ask Canadians for the chance to serve as prime minister “so we can get this country back on track.”

Erin O’Toole won the leadership of the Conservative Party with a “True Blue” platform, but is vowing to broaden the party’s appeal as the focus shifts to the next election.

Strong organization in Quebec, an effective digital campaign and a message that won the later ballot support of social conservatives are widely viewed as key elements of the Ontario MP’s success.

In the early hours of Monday morning, Mr. O’Toole won the leadership in the third round after securing the ranked-ballot votes of many supporters of Leslyn Lewis, a Toronto lawyer and social conservative who placed third in the race. Former cabinet minister Peter MacKay placed second, and Conservative MP Derek Sloan was fourth.

Mr. O’Toole fared particularly well in Quebec, and at least one member of Parliament believes it helped that he has a seat in the House of Commons, unlike Mr. MacKay and Ms. Lewis.

Mr. O’Toole could be running to become prime minister in a matter of months – if not weeks. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last week prorogued Parliament until late September, as his minority Liberal government faltered under the weight of the WE Charity controversy and last week’s departure of finance minister Bill Morneau. When it returns, a Throne Speech will trigger a confidence vote, and depending on the outcome, possibly a general election.

In his victory speech early Monday morning, Mr. O’Toole said Conservatives must continue to “point out Liberal failings,” but also show Canadians their vision for the country. And after a campaign prolonged by the COVID-19 pandemic in which Mr. O’Toole sought to assert himself as more conservative than his chief opponent, he pivoted in his speech, speaking to Canadians about why he should be leader.

“I believe that whether you are Black, white, brown or from any race or creed. Whether you are LGBT or straight. Whether you are an Indigenous Canadian or have joined the Canadian family five weeks ago or five generations ago. Whether you are doing well, or barely getting by. Whether you worship on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, or not at all, you are an important part of Canada and you have a home in the Conservative Party of Canada,” he said.

“It is time for many Liberal and NDP voters to socially distance themselves from these out-of-touch parties. It’s time for more Canadians to look at the Conservative Party again.”

Conservative MP Peter Kent, who supported Mr. O’Toole’s leadership bid, said the speech was “exactly right” and recognized the party’s big tent.

“I thought that he hit just about every note that Conservatives want to hear, and I’m sure, and I hope, Canadians want to hear,” Mr. Kent said.

He also said having a seat in the House of Commons helped Mr. O’Toole, adding that in the midst of a pandemic, the leader needs to be in the House.

Tim Powers, a Conservative strategist and vice-chairman of Summa Strategies, said Mr. O’Toole’s disposition shifted over the course of his speech, becoming increasingly warmer, and indicative of how he is known.

“What the O’Toole team did very well is they picked a narrative that their candidate maybe didn’t naturally fit into, but it was a comfortable enough narrative for their second choice targets that it worked for them,” he said.

Mr. O’Toole is scheduled to address the media on Tuesday in Ottawa.

Mr. MacKay led on the first ballot, but Mr. O’Toole overtook him on the second and third ballots once Ms. Lewis and Mr. Sloan were eliminated. Ms. Lewis secured the most votes on the second ballot, but because the system is based on allocating 100 points for each of the 338 ridings rather than total votes, she was eliminated.

On the third and final round, many of Ms. Lewis’s supporters switched to Mr. O’Toole, allowing him to win with 57 per cent of the points and 58.9 per cent of the vote. Mr. MacKay received 43 per cent of the points and 41.1 per cent of the vote in the third and final round.

Mr. O’Toole had an aggressive social-media presence in the campaign.

Earlier this year, Jeff Ballingall joined the O’Toole campaign to manage digital strategy. Mr. Ballingall is founder of conservative Facebook group Ontario Proud and co-founder of the right-wing website The Post Millennial, which published stories about the leadership campaign that were generally favourable toward Mr. O’Toole and critical of Mr. MacKay.

The Post Millennial items would often be shared by Ontario Proud’s Facebook account to its more than 450,000 followers.

Mr. MacKay congratulated Mr. O’Toole and called for the party to unite behind him. “I feel we ran a valiant and high-road campaign,” he said on Monday afternoon on Twitter. “It was an amazing experience, though not the result we hoped for. I now get to focus on family and future forms of public service.”

Quebec Senator Leo Housakos, who was a national co-chair of Mr. O’Toole’s campaign, said Mr. O’Toole gained the support of members in Quebec because he had a Quebec-specific platform, recognized the province as a nation, took time to improve his French, and didn’t shy away from French television interviews.

“I have to say over the last few months, his improvement on the French language has been exponential and it’s not something that went unnoticed by Quebeckers,” Mr. Housakos said. Conversely, Ms. Lewis’s campaign acknowledged her weakness in French proved costly.

Jenni Byrne, a former deputy chief of staff to prime minister Stephen Harper, and the chief executive officer of public affairs consultancy firm Jenni Byrne + Associates, said Mr. O’Toole’s strategy of attracting Ms. Lewis’s supporters on the ranked ballot was successful, as was his digital campaign.

“I think it was very robust,” she said.

Ms. Lewis, who is anti-abortion and opposes legislation that would ban conversion therapy on LBGTQ people, clearly emerged as a new political force inside the Conservative Party, reigniting debate among Conservatives over how Mr. O’Toole should manage his party’s socially conservative wing.

After the Conservatives’ election defeat, Mr. MacKay described then-leader Andrew Scheer’s struggles in discussing his social conservative views as a “stinking albatross” around his neck that contributed to the Liberal victory.

“It is fair to say that social conservatives gave MacKay a ‘spanking,’ ” the Campaign Life Coalition said in a statement on Monday. The group said that while Mr. O’Toole is not a social conservative, it expects he will ensure those members of the party are respected.

Steve Outhouse, who managed the Lewis campaign, said her strong showing shows solid support among Conservatives for a candidate who holds socially conservative views while also speaking of party unity and focusing on a wide range of policy issues.

“There’s this this oft-repeated belief that we can’t win with social conservatives. And I think we all need to move past that and say we can’t win without social conservatives,” he said in an interview on Monday.

Andrew Brander, a senior consultant with Crestview Strategy and a chief of staff to Lisa Raitt when she was deputy Conservative leader, said on Monday that Mr. O’Toole will need to do everything he can help Canadians get to know him.

“The one thing we learned from the last campaign is when you’re introducing yourself to people during the election, it is already too late and your opponents have largely defined you by that point,” he said.

The total cost should hit federal books this year, but the budget office warns there may be potential fiscal impacts in subsequent years.

The first legislative push to provide the special payments failed in June when the minority Liberal government couldn’t gain opposition support for a wider spending bill.

A few weeks later, a compromise was struck whereby the Liberals expanded eligibility for the payments to also include veterans.

Payments will max out at $600, drop to $300 for any recipients who receive old age security benefits, and fall to $100 for low-income seniors who receive OAS and the guaranteed income supplement.

The report from the budget watchdog Wednesday notes its estimate on the number of people eligible to receive the payments could be thrown off a bit by a separate part of the federal response to the pandemic.

That is because one of the requirements for payments is to be eligible for the disability tax credit, or having applied for the credit by Sept. 25.

The PBO report says the government’s extension for filing personal income tax returns could reduce the rate at which people recertify for the credit, but calls it a minor source of uncertainty.

The budget office has been independently tracking federal spending through the pandemic to provide its own analysis over the accuracy of government projections.

It updated one of those projections this week in regarding to a special paid leave for federal employees, known as pay code 699.

The policy gives federal workers paid time off for emergencies such as having to quarantine with COVID-19 or to care for children or other dependants, and doesn’t require them to use up vacation or sick days first.

Adding in data from June, the budget office estimates that paid leave has cost the government $828-million since March, inclusive of pension and other benefits. That works out to an average of $3,430 per worker who accessed the leave over that time.

The figures also include estimates for departments that haven’t provided data to the budget office.

The report says the number of hours claimed under the policy is “almost certainly an underestimation of the loss of work hours due to the pandemic.”

Use of the policy has dropped from a peak of 72,700 federal workers in April to just over 43,300 in June, the PBO says. The Canada Revenue Agency continues to have the largest share of workers using the leave.

“The Canada Revenue Agency was able to continue many of its core operations despite claiming by far the most hours of 699 leave. This is due to a strong culture of monitoring time spent on specific activities,” the budget office wrote on its website.

“It is therefore highly likely that other federal organizations not completing core operating functions like meeting legislated timelines for access-to-information requests are severely under-reporting the extent of hours of work lost due to the pandemic.”

The federal government announced $82.5-million to be spent this year on urgent mental-wellness support in Indigenous communities in response to the added burden of COVID-19.

Recent Statistics Canada studies have highlighted mental-health disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in the country, Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller said on Parliament Hill on Tuesday as he unveiled the new funding.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the situation,” he said.

Story continues below advertisement

There had already been a growing demand for mental-health counselling and support before the pandemic, Mr. Miller said. He noted that Hope for Wellness, a help line for Indigenous people across the country, received 3,602 calls and chats from individuals seeking assistance from January to April, 2019, while there were more than 10,000 in the same period this year.

“The full impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and wellness of Indigenous peoples and communities will likely not be fully appreciated until long after we emerge from this pandemic,” he said.

Stress is being felt within and across communities and stressful situations can trigger past trauma, he said.

Mr. Miller said the funding will support access to additional mental-wellness services and help adapt them to the COVID-19 context.

He noted, for example, the need to shift some services to virtual platforms and to support Indigenous communities in the development of strategies to address substance abuse and harm reduction.

In a statement on Tuesday, Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde said it is good to see the federal government and the minister recognizing the issue of mental health and providing additional resources to help First Nations people and families get through the pandemic.

Nishnawbe Aski Nation Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler, whose organization represents 49 First Nations in Northern Ontario, told The Globe and Mail on Tuesday it was encouraging to hear about the federal government’s commitment to address the serious mental-health challenges he is seeing.

The services “are desperately needed and communities need to be able to access these types of supports, especially now that we are moving into the fall and the possible reopening of many of our schools.”

But Mr. Fiddler said that people need more specifics about what Tuesday’s announcement entails.

“I think what’s concerning though is any time there is especially a national announcement like this that there is never any clarity on the process, on how quickly communities can access these much-needed resources.”

Ottawa also plans to help financially with the return to school for First Nations children, Mr. Miller said Tuesday.

Indigenous Services Canada is aware of 437 positive cases of COVID-19 in First Nations and six deaths.

“This is encouraging and demonstrates that many communities have been successful in their efforts to stop the spread of the virus thanks to the leadership they’ve shown and the actions they’ve taken,” Mr. Miller said.

The federal government is pledging $82.5-million to improve access and address growing demand for mental health services in Indigenous communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Access to many mental health services within Indigenous communities have been disrupted due to the pandemic, while some services have shifted to virtual and telehealth treatment options, creating obstacles for those living in remote communities that have limited connectivity.

Meanwhile, demand for services has surged.

In the first four months of this year, the Hope for Wellness Help Line, which provides telephone and online support for First Nations, Inuit and Metis in a number of Indigenous languages, received over 10,000 calls and chats from people seeking crisis intervention services.

This represents a 178 per cent increase in demand compared to the same time period in 2019.

Also, the First Nations Health Authority in B.C. reported last month that First Nations overdose deaths almost doubled between January and May of this year.

Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller acknowledged Tuesday that a disparity exists between mental wellness support available to Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in Canada and called this situation unacceptable.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the situation,” Miller said.

“Sustained, targeted investment is needed to ensure that culturally safe mental wellness services remain available and community-driven, culturally appropriate and timely mental health supports are critical to the well-being for anyone struggling to cope with the added stress and anxiety that the COVID-19 pandemic has created.”

The new federal funding will support access to additional services, such as transitioning some services to virtual platforms to meet increased demand.

It will also support Indigenous partners in developing new ways to address substance use and to improve access to treatment and it will work to expand access to culturally appropriate services such as on-the-land activities, community-based health supports and mental wellness teams.

The new funds are a response to calls from many First Nations, Inuit and Metis leaders who have been pushing for more mental health supports in their communities, Miller said.

Intergenerational trauma suffered by many Indigenous people due to Canada’s history of colonialism and mistreatment of Canada’s First Peoples is already a deeply difficult issue to address when it comes to mental health treatment, said Dr. Tom Wong, chief medical officer of public health for Indigenous Services Canada The additional anxiety of the COVID-19 pandemic has only made things worse, he said.

The negative effects of COVID-19 physical distancing restrictions have also led to increased rates of family violence against women and have also caused further isolation of Indigenous youth and those in the LGBTQ+ and two-spirit communities.

“We all need to be standing behind First Nations, Metis and Inuit in responding to the mental wellness, mental health crisis in Canada. It is extremely important that we stand behind them so that no communities are left behind,” Wong said.

Funding will be allocated to First Nations, Inuit and Metis communities based on discussions among national and regional partnership tables or regional governing leaders.

There will also be some funds remaining to enable surge capacity and adaptation among national organizations and services, such as the Thunderbird Partnership Foundation, First Peoples Wellness Circle and Hope for Wellness Line.

Newly elected Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole spent the first two days of his leadership declaring his party’s openness and shaking off any notion that he might be a social conservative: He is pro-choice and supports gay marriage.

Mr. O’Toole held his first news conference as Conservative Leader on Tuesday where he spoke again about welcoming people to his party. He repeated part of his victory speech, delivered around 1 a.m. Monday, saying that people from any race or creed, LGBTQ or straight, Indigenous or new to Canada, and from any faith “have a home” in the Conservative Party. However, Mr. O’Toole still faced questions about social conservatives and abortion at his news conference.

“I have a clear track record on standing up for human rights whether it’s women, whether it’s the LGBT community. I won the leadership of the Conservative Party as a pro-choice Conservative MP, one that won with a strong mandate. That’s how I’m going to lead as the Leader of the Opposition and that’s how I will be as Prime Minister,” Mr. O’Toole told reporters. During the previous federal election, then-Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said he was personally against abortion, after dodging the question for weeks.

Mr. O’Toole won the leadership in the third round of balloting after securing the ranked-ballot votes of many supporters of Leslyn Lewis, a Toronto lawyer and social conservative who placed third in the race. Former cabinet minister Peter MacKay placed second and Conservative MP Derek Sloan, also a social conservative, was fourth.

Conservative strategist Kate Harrison, the vice-president of Summa Strategies and a former political staffer, said Tuesday that Mr. O’Toole’s initial remarks as leader have been a deliberate attempt to shift the tone of how Conservatives may be perceived by the broader public.

“I think that he wants Canadians to know that there is a Conservative alternative and a Conservative vision that doesn’t leave people out in the cold, particularly at a time when people need help and support, but that this Conservative Party under his leadership would be one that would be a bit more forward thinking, a bit more visionary in its plan and trying to be more inclusive,” she said.

When asked if he felt he owed social conservatives anything because he gained some of their support, Mr. O’Toole said he will “treat all of our members with respect” and repeated that he was elected as a pro-choice MP.

Jack Fonseca, political operations director for Campaign Life Coalition, said his organization knew where Mr. O’Toole stood on abortion and so it recommended its supporters rank Ms. Lewis and Mr. Sloan as their top choices, and avoid ranking Mr. O’Toole or Mr. MacKay at all. However, he said, Mr. O’Toole would not have won without the support of social conservatives, adding he will also need their support to win the federal election.

“I think he would be very foolish, especially two days after seeing the influence and strength of the social conservatives that are his natural base, to offer them nothing. … They need something to chew on,” Mr. Fonseca said.

Mr. O’Toole skirted a question about whether his leadership rival Mr. Sloan should be expelled from caucus for comments he made during the leadership race.

Story continues below advertisement

In a statement on Tuesday, Liberal MP Pam Damoff urged Mr. O’Toole to remove Mr. Sloan from the Conservative caucus. “Mr. O’Toole has an important decision to make, which will help Canadians understand his vision for the future of our country: He can stand up for the rights of all Canadians, or he can condone racism, misogyny and bigotry within his own caucus,” Ms. Damoff said.

In April, Mr. Sloan refused to apologize after questioning Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam’s loyalty to the country, asking in a Facebook video: “Does she work for Canada or for China?” He later said his comments were “deliberately” mischaracterized by the Liberals.

Mr. O’Toole said there’s always pressure and contrasting ideas in leadership campaigns but now the race is over.

“I received a clear mandate and I’m very excited to meet with my caucus and talk with all of them about uniting, and going forward together, and I’ll be doing that in the coming days and weeks,” he said.

Mr. O’Toole also laid out some of his priorities, saying that as prime minister he would lead a government that rebuilds the economy and creates long-term jobs with ambitious projects. He said he will propose programs that will make it easier for people to “get ahead” and also spoke about national unity and the need to support the resources sector to alleviate the feeling of alienation in Western Canada.

He also said that his party will be tough on China: “We will trade freely with free nations and not spend our time chasing trade deals with predatory countries like Communist China.”

The new leader could find himself running to become prime minister in a matter of months – if not weeks. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last week requested a prorogation of Parliament until late September. When it returns a Throne Speech will trigger a confidence vote, and, depending on the outcome, possibly a general election.

Mr. O’Toole would not say how he intends to vote on the Throne Speech, saying it will be discussed in the future. However, he said because of that, he may soon ask Canadians for the chance to serve as prime minister “so we can get this country back on track.”

Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he won’t campaign for the federal Conservative Party in the next election because he is too busy running the province, but he is urging party members to rally around new leader Erin O’Toole.

Mr. Ford congratulated Mr. O’Toole – who represents the Toronto-area riding of Durham – for winning a hard-fought leadership campaign. But the Premier said he won’t be getting involved in the next federal election, which could come as early as the fall.

“I won’t be campaigning for anyone, like I didn’t last time either. I am so swamped right here, I’m going literally around the clock, every single day, and I can’t take my eye off the ball for an election or anything else,” Mr. Ford told reporters at Queen’s Park on Monday.

“I’m going to take the high road here. I’m going to just work hard with Ontario. I wish them all the best.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prorogued Parliament last week until late September. When it returns, a Throne Speech will trigger a confidence vote and, depending on the outcome, possibly a general election.

Mr. Ford has been working closely with the federal government during the pandemic, appearing alongside Mr. Trudeau at an announcement last week, for instance, and frequently praising Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland.

But Mr. Trudeau repeatedly attacked Mr. Ford on the campaign trail in 2019. Former Conservative leader Andrew Scheer did not campaign with or even mention the Premier, who at the time was facing an outcry over spending cuts. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney was brought in to campaign in the Toronto area instead.

As his government tackles the COVID-19 crisis, Mr. Ford has worked to repair his image and has enjoyed a close working relationship with Ms. Freeland, who was recently named Finance Minister.

“I think the world of the Deputy Prime Minister. We are able to get a lot accomplished just by communicating and collaborating – and along with the Prime Minister as well,” Mr. Ford said.

He said he will work with governments of any stripe.

Political parties of all stripes have gone into preparation mode in anticipation of an election that could be called in just a few weeks.

Early Monday, the Conservatives named Erin O’Toole as their new leader, and hours after delivering his acceptance speech, the former cabinet minister tweeted a picture of himself heading into the office of the Official Opposition on Parliament Hill.

“Thankful for the victory and humbled with the work ahead,” he wrote. “Let’s get going!”

The political stakes now are high.

Erin O’Toole wins federal Conservative leadership race

He’s won. Here’s what Erin O’Toole has to do next

The governing Liberals have prorogued Parliament and promised a Speech from the Throne in September to lay out a new vision for the government to shape the economic recovery from the pandemic.

A Speech from the Throne sets out the government’s view of the condition of the country and gives a sense of the legislation it intends to bring forward in the new session. After the speech, a vote is held, which is seen as a test of the support for the government.

The Liberals hold a minority of seats in the House of Commons and have relied on the backing of the NDP and the Bloc Québécois since last fall’s federal election.

The Bloc has threatened this summer to force an election, while the NDP has gauged its support for the government issue by issue. It has worked closely with the Liberals in an attempt to influence policy during COVID-19.

The Conservatives have been highly critical in recent weeks of the government over a now-cancelled contract with the WE Charity, but they have not indicated they want an election.

Nik Nanos, the founder and chief data scientist of Nanos Research, told The Globe and Mail on Monday that the Conservatives might want to capitalize on the WE political controversy, which has affected support for the Liberals.

“The one thing that the Conservatives have in their favour is they’ve just come off a leadership, a leadership that was conducted primarily in the pandemic era where they used social media and technology to reach out to Conservative Party members,” Mr. Nanos said.

“They would just be building off of the momentum and organizational momentum of the leadership race.”

The Conservative Party is not in debt, Mr. Nanos said, adding that a snap election call in September would not give the Liberals much time to define or characterize Mr. O’Toole.

It is likely that the Liberals, the Conservatives and the Bloc are prepared for a potential election, he added, saying the one party to watch is the New Democrats.

“They are probably the party that is the least election-ready compared to the other parties,” he said.

“The focus will be on them as to whether they are willing to trigger an election even if they might not be ready or whether they are going to prop up the Liberals.”

Story continues below advertisement

NDP national director Anne McGrath said in an interview that her party won’t support the Liberal government just to prevent an election.

“Would we be ready if there was one in the fall? Absolutely. ... Our support is entirely dependent on whether or not we can force the government to come up with the measures that are necessary to support people during this pandemic and beyond.”

Parties must always be ready for an election during a minority Parliament, she said.

“My experience in minority Parliaments also is that there are often a lot of rumours about an election, and they may or may not happen at the time that people think they’re going to.”

Similarly, the Greens’ Elizabeth May told The Globe on Monday that parties always have to be prepared for an election in a minority Parliament and acknowledged that efforts have intensified ahead of the Speech from the Throne.

The Liberals have hinted that the Speech from the Throne will include a vision of an economic recovery focused on green initiatives, she said, adding she suspected her party would be in a position to support it depending on what it says.

The Greens are to name a new leader on the first weekend of October.

“We have a very competitive race and I have no idea who is going to be the next leader,” she said.

Green Party interim leader Jo-Ann Roberts added in a statement that the party says it would be irresponsible to trigger an election in the midst of a pandemic.

Braeden Caley, the senior director of communications for the Liberal Party, said his party’s priority is to support Canadians during the challenging time caused by COVID-19.

The party has been holding virtual events that included thousands of members, he added.

“Over the course of the spring and summer, we’ve also been continuing to hear ideas from Liberal MPs, past candidates and grassroots Liberals across Canada on the best process to help elect even more Liberal MPs whenever the next campaign arrives,” he said.

“The party is continuing to hear strong interest from a wide array of dedicated community leaders seeking to run as new Liberal candidates, and we’ll have more to share about the new nominations process soon.”

The Conservative Party’s selection of Erin O’Toole as its new leader brings to the opposition helm a politician who advocates a far more skeptical approach to China at a time when relations between Ottawa and Beijing are already strained.

Mr. O’Toole, who in recent months has met with representatives of the Uyghur, Tibetan and Hong Kong activist communities, is openly critical of what he calls Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s “fawning” approach to China and has described a vision of co-ordinated action among large democracies to press Beijing to change.

In his rhetoric and approach toward China, Mr. O’Toole hews more closely to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo – and even U.S. President Donald Trump – than to the more cautious and amicable approach that has been the hallmark of Liberal governments dating back to Pierre Trudeau. He calls himself the “natural inheritor” of the Stephen Harper approach to policy; in his early days in office, Mr. Harper refused to attend the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and pledged support for Canadian values abroad over selling out “to the almighty dollar.”

Story continues below advertisement

“It’s the Cold War again,” Mr. O’Toole told The Globe and Mail in an extensive interview about his views on China in late May. It’s time, he argued, that “the West should adjust and start curtailing some of the risks that the Communist system poses.”

Among the policies he advocates for Canada: banning Chinese tech giant Huawei from 5G networks; increasing the scrutiny of foreign investments on national security grounds; pursuing partial decoupling from the Chinese economy; and a more skeptical approach to foreign students and professors engaged in sensitive research in Canada. “There should be more screening,” he said.

That should mean reducing economic ties with China, he said, arguing that any cost borne by Canada and its allies is worth it – particularly if it hurts Beijing enough to compel a change in course.

China’s “political system is a threat to Canadian interests, to Canadian citizens – certainly in Hong Kong – and they are one of the largest funders and implementers of cyberattacks,” Mr. O’Toole said. “So there are threats inherent from the Communist system that Canada has to take seriously.” He pointed to the initial response in China to COVID-19, which included arresting doctors for discussing the spread of a SARS-like virus.

“The foot dragging and covering up of the early outbreak of the coronavirus is probably having a greater economic impact than anything outside of wartime,” Mr. O’Toole said. “Is that not a threat? We could have 25-per-cent unemployment in Alberta. This is the eyes-wide-open effect that we need to see Beijing with.”

The Chinese government says it notified the World Health Organization about the new coronavirus in a timely manner. And the country’s leadership has frequently touted its commitments to foreign trade and international organizations under the United Nations.

Mr. O’Toole also favours altering Canada’s stand on Taiwan, the self-administered region that Beijing claims as its own territory. Mr. O’Toole would “put caveats to the ‘one China’ policy based on Chinese misconduct.” That could mean supporting Taiwan’s membership in international bodies such as the WHO and the International Civil Aviation Organization, where Taipei is currently represented formally by Beijing.

And, he argued, if China does not abide by its own international agreements, such as those regarding Hong Kong – to which Mr. O’Toole has a direct connection through family members who live there – then countries such as Canada may need to consider a corresponding “realignment” on issues such as Taiwan.

While he stopped short of backing diplomatic recognition of Taiwan – a move that would almost certainly cause Beijing to sever relations with Ottawa – he says Canada should “constantly re-evaluate the policy” based on China’s conduct.

A more hawkish approach to China is out of step with large segments of Canada’s corporate community, which has continued to seek closer ties with the rising superpower – the world’s most important manufacturing centre and an increasingly prominent source of capital, expertise and technology.

The Liberals came to power in 2015 intent on reinvigorating trans-Pacific ties with a country whose continued economic growth has given it increasing global influence. Canada struck a series of agreements with China, including one to begin negotiations for a free-trade agreement and another to pursue an extradition treaty. Those priorities have since fallen by the wayside, particularly amid Beijing’s fury over the arrest in Canada of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, who is wanted on fraud charges in the United States.

Ottawa has condemned Beijing’s conduct in its Xinjiang region – where authorities have sent hundreds of thousands of people, mostly Uyghurs, to political indoctrination camps – and its crackdown on democracy activists in Hong Kong, but it has not taken dramatic action in response to the arrest in China of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, nor to Chinese authorities blocking imports of some Canadian agricultural goods.

But Canadian public sentiment has soured on China in the past two years, opinion polls show – and a re-evaluation of policies on China is taking place in a number of liberal democracies.

Mr. O’Toole envisions Canada and the other members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance – the U.S., Britain, Australia and New Zealand – as well as other developed democracies such as France and Japan banding together to press the Chinese government for change.

“We can’t stand idly by when the rules-based international order is being flouted. We have to rebalance it or enforce it,” he said. “Because we’re small, the only way we can do it is with our allies.”

There is widespread concern about a United States approach to mining in space that experts warn could result in a Wild West-style free-for-all where countries set their own rules for extraterrestrial resource extraction and friction develops among leading nations.

Advocates of a global treaty have written UN General Assembly president Tijjani Muhammad-Bande this month, asking him to seek a resolution that would initiate multilateral negotiations on the matter.

Signatories to the letter include three Nobel laureates, three former Canadian foreign ministers, and a former deputy secretary-general of the United Nations, as well as popular TV science personality Bill Nye.

U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked unease with an executive order he signed in April that rejected the idea of outer space as a region that lies outside of national jurisdiction.

“Outer space is a legally and physically unique domain of human activity, and the United States does not view it as a global commons,” the Trump executive order said.

Signatories to the request for the UN to intervene believe space must be regulated internationally – similarly to Antarctica or the world’s seabeds – and all countries, including non-space-faring ones, get a say in decision-making. The alternative, they warn, could be a splintered approach where companies conduct flag-of-convenience resource extraction in space under whichever country has the least onerous rules.

The matter has become a pressing concern as the cost of accessing space has dropped dramatically because of advances in the miniaturization of technology and the advent of reusable rockets as pioneered by Elon Musk’s SpaceX.

One real attraction, experts say, is ice and water-bearing minerals that could be used to produce fuel in space, a potentially cheaper option than carrying terrestrial fuel that must escape Earth’s gravity. “The real interest is in using resources from space in space to support deep-space missions or develop an off-Earth economy,” says Michael Byers, one of the signatories and organizers who is Canada Research Chair in Global Politics and International Law at the University of British Columbia and co-director of The Outer Space Institute.

Prof. Byers said the matter is no longer a distant concern. ”We’re seeing more satellites launched in a year now than were launched in a decade during the late 20th century.”

A multilateral UN agreement would help minimize international conflicts over the coming race for space resources, the letter writers say.

The current international legal regime for outer space is based on five treaties that were adopted by the UN General Assembly more than 40 years ago.

The letter is also a response to the Trump administration’s efforts, in bilateral negotiations with Canada and other NASA partner states, to secure support for the U.S. position that commercial space mining can take place on the moon and asteroids under national regulation and even in the absence of broader agreement.

It’s expected that these negotiations – on what the U.S. has called the “Artemis Accords” – might demand Canadian government support for the U.S. position as a condition for sending a Canadian astronaut to the moon.

The Canadian government has already agreed to contribute a robotic Canadarm to the Lunar Gateway, a space station the United States plans to build in orbit around the moon.

Canada has also provided a laser altimeter, a scanning and measuring instrument, for a NASA probe, OSIRIS-REx, currently on a mission to secure a mineral sample from an asteroid.

Signatories to the letter include Nobel laureates Michel Mayor with the University of Geneva, John Polanyi with the University of Toronto and Didier Queloz with the University of Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory and the University of Geneva, as well as Louise Fréchette, a former deputy secretary-general of the United Nations.

Mr. Nye, best known as the host of the 1990s TV show Bill Nye the Science Guy, signed the letter on behalf of The Planetary Society, a Pasadena, Calif., non-profit that promotes space exploration."

Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne is heading to Lebanon this week to get a firsthand look at the devastation caused by the deadly explosions in Beirut and urge the country’s government to start getting real in the fight against corruption.

The visit is one stop on a multicountry tour, Mr. Champagne’s first overseas since many countries around the world – including Canada – slammed their borders shut in March to slow the spread of COVID-19.

It comes nearly three weeks after a powerful explosion at Beirut’s port ripped through the city, killing at least 180 people, injuring more than 6,000 and leaving much of Lebanon’s capital in ruins. Two Canadians are among the dead.

Canada has so far committed $30-million to help pay for emergency food, water, shelter and medical assistance in the immediate aftermath, and Mr. Champagne said he plans to meet with aid workers to see the progress and hear about their needs.

“I’m going there by choice to support all our efforts, to support the people on the ground,” Mr. Champagne told The Canadian Press in an interview on Sunday, adding: “We have about 25 [diplomatic] staff there and some 20 of them lost their homes in the blast.”

The minister, who is currently in Switzerland, is also set to meet members of Lebanon’s beleaguered government, which many Lebanese believe is culpable for the explosion due to years of negligence and widespread corruption.

A report emerged over the weekend saying the Lebanese government had been warned numerous times over the years about the stockpile of ammonium nitrate being improperly stored at the port, near several residential neighbourhoods.

Many Lebanese took the streets after the explosion demanding an independent investigation into the explosion and an end to the wider problem of corruption – a call that was echoed by members of the 200,000-strong Lebanese community in Canada.

Mr. Champagne said he plans to convey that message to Lebanese President Michel Aoun when the two meet this week in Beirut, and add the Canadian government’s own voice to those demands.

“I thought it was important for me to carry the voice of the community in Canada, which has spoken in very clear terms to me about the need for governance, about the need for reforms, about the need to rebuild the country,” Mr. Champagne said.

Asked what immediate steps the Lebanese government could take to show its sincerity, Mr. Champagne echoed previous calls for an independent investigation, adding Canada was willing to assist by deploying RCMP officers.

Mr. Champagne said Lebanon had actually already accepted such an offer, which would see the Mounties working alongside FBI agents and counterparts from the French national police, but that Canada wants to see the terms of such an investigation first.

“We want a credible, transparent and thorough investigation so my point will be to President Aoun: ‘If you want Canada to participate alongside the FBI and the French national police, there are conditions around that,” ’ Mr. Champagne said.

“We offered it, we got a response from the Lebanese government. But now I want to make sure the conditions under which we are prepared is because we want to get to the truth, we want to get to justice, we want accountability and transparency.”

Mr. Champagne is in Switzerland meeting various United Nations officials as well as the head of the World Economic Forum and World Trade Organization. He will also visit Italy and Britain before returning home, where he’ll quarantine for 14 days.

Mr. Champagne noted that Italy is taking over the presidency of the Group of Twenty next year while Britain is moving into the same position for the Group of Seven, and he suggested his visit to the two countries was intended to help shape their respective agendas.

“It’s another way for Canada to influence the agenda, the global agenda,” he said.

“That was also part of my discussions today for example with the head of the World Economic Forum, to try to see how do we rebuild better, how do we rebuild greener, how do we build together.”

Erin O’Toole, an Ontario member of Parliament, defeated Conservative heavyweight Peter MacKay and was named leader of the Conservative Party early Monday.

Mr. O’Toole spent 12 years in the military and 10 years as a corporate lawyer. He ran a pointed, message-driven campaign and embraced becoming the inheritor of Stephen Harper’s party. This was Mr. O’Toole’s second time running for leadership of the party; he was defeated in 2017 by Andrew Scheer. Mr. O’Toole won with 57 per cent of the vote on the third ballot. “Today you have given me a clear mission to unite our party, to champion our Conservative principles, to show Canadians what we know so well — that Justin Trudeau and his team are failing our great country,” Mr. O’Toole said in his victory speech shortly after 1:00 a.m. ET.

“We must continue to point out Liberal failings and corruption but we also must show Canadians our vision for a stronger, prosperous and more united Canada,” he said.

Story continues below advertisement

After thanking Conservative supporters for electing him as leader, Mr. O’Toole aimed his message at a broader audience, telling viewers that regardless of their background, circumstance or political affiliation, they have a place in the Conservative Party.

“It is time for many Liberal and NDP voters to socially distance themselves from these out of touch parties,” he said, adding that it’s time for more Canadians to consider the Conservative Party again.

Toronto lawyer Leslyn Lewis, who is relatively new to politics, came third in the race and Conservative MP Derek Sloan, who also had the support of social conservatives, placed fourth.

The leadership results were announced hours later than planned because thousands of ballots had been sliced by a dysfunctional mail-opening machine.

Cory Hann, a spokesperson for the Conservative Party, said the envelope-opening machines sliced through “a few thousand” ballots during the counting process. Volunteers then had to mark the ballots that had been affected as scrutineers from the leadership campaigns kept watch.

The party said it received 174,849 ballots by mail. Party members began counting them early on Sunday morning, and the first round of results was initially scheduled to be revealed around 6:30 p.m. ET, but the time continued to be pushed back.

As the leadership contenders waited to hear the results, Mr. Scheer, in his final speech as outgoing leader, told party members to move past the division of the last 10 months and focus on how to defeat the governing Liberals.

Story continues below advertisement

“After tonight, let’s all come together and focus on the things that unite us,” Mr. Scheer said. “We must stay squarely concentrated on working together and focusing on the many things we share in common.”

Mr. MacKay congratulated Mr. O’Toole on a “hard-fought campaign” on Twitter. “It’s now time for our party and movement to come together, and to focus on what’s most important: ensuring our country gets moving in the right direction again,” he wrote.

Suzanne Cowan, president of the Liberal Party, issued a statement congratulating Mr. O’Toole, but also said she hopes he reconsiders continuing to push “the same policies of Stephen Harper and Andrew Scheer that he also proposed in the leadership campaign.”

Mr. O’Toole could find himself running to become Prime Minister in a matter of months — if not weeks. As Mr. Trudeau’s minority Liberal government faltered under the weight of the WE Charity controversy and the sudden departure of Finance Minister Bill Morneau, the Prime Minister asked for Parliament to be prorogued until late September. When it returns, the Speech from the Throne will trigger a confidence vote, and depending on the outcome of that vote, possibly a general election.

Even if an election doesn’t come soon, Mr. O’Toole will take the helm during a rocky time in Ottawa. As the governing Liberals turn their attention to economic recovery on the heels of the pandemic lockdowns, the Conservatives will seek to assert themselves as the country’s voice of fiscal discipline.

Mr. O’Toole takes over from Mr. Scheer who was elected in 2017 but failed to defeat Mr. Trudeau’s Liberals in the 2019 election. Mr. Scheer resigned after the disappointing election loss that created division within the party but also after revelations that he used party money to pay for his children’s private school tuition.

Mr. Scheer’s resignation set the leadership race in motion and a contest was officially underway in January, with contestants having until the end of February to enter but also needing to meet criteria set by the party to qualify. Some Conservative heavyweights, including Rona Ambrose and Jean Charest, considered entering the race but ultimately decided against it.

The campaign lasted much longer than anticipated, having been temporarily halted at the end of March because of the pandemic. The race started again in April, with candidates campaigning primarily online and at physically distanced events.

Mr. MacKay and Mr. O’Toole had both been considered the front-runners in the race, based on their profiles and fundraising numbers. However, Conservatives have been surprised by the performance Ms. Lewis — specifically her fundraising prowess. Ms. Lewis, a social conservative, holds a PhD in law and a master’s degree in environmental studies.

Mr. Sloan, the member of Parliament for Hastings-Lennox and Addington in eastern Ontario, courted the fringes of the party during the race. He was known throughout the campaign for making controversial comments. In April, Mr. Sloan refused to apologize after questioning Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam’s loyalty to the country, asking in a Facebook video: “Does she work for Canada or for China?” He later said his comments were “deliberately” mischaracterized by the Liberals.

Mr. MacKay raised more money than his opponents, with nearly $3.1-million in donations. Mr. O’Toole raised $2.5-million, Ms. Lewis’s team said it passed the $2-million mark and Mr. Sloan raised $852,000, according to data from two interim reports filed with Elections Canada earlier this month.

Mr. O’Toole may also find himself preparing for an election in the fall. The fact that the Prime Minister has prorogued Parliament and set a date for a confidence vote after the Throne Speech shows that the Liberals are open to risking an election, according to pollster Nik Nanos.

Mr. Nanos said the Liberal advantage over Conservatives at the height of the pandemic has eroded with the WE Charity controversy and that “anger and pessimism directed against the government in Ottawa is on the rise.” Mr. Nanos said the WE controversy has turned some voters off from even considering voting Liberal.

The federal lobbying commissioner is reviewing a report that Rob Silver, the spouse of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s chief of staff, Katie Telford, contacted senior Liberal staff on behalf of his employer’s efforts to seek changes to the federal wage subsidy program.

In an e-mail to The Globe and Mail on Friday, spokesperson Manon Dion said the commissioner’s office, an independent body, is looking at the matter.

“The office can confirm that we have opened a preliminary assessment. Given the possibility that these matters may become police investigations, the office is unable to confirm or deny whether an investigation has been initiated or is ongoing,” she said.

Spouse of PM’s chief of staff had meeting on Liberals’ rent-relief program

Vice News reported on Friday that after the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy was announced in April, Mr. Silver contacted Liberal aides in the Prime Minister’s Office and in the office of then-finance minister Bill Morneau, seeking legislative changes to it. Mr. Silver joined independent mortgage finance company MCAP in January. He is senior vice-president of strategy, policy and risk, according to his LinkedIn profile.

MCAP does not qualify for the program because it is majority owned by the Caisse de dépôt et placement de Québec, the provincial pension fund. Citing sources, Vice said Mr. Silver contacted Mr. Morneau’s chief of staff, Elder Marques and the minister’s policy adviser, Tyler Meredith, seeking changes that would make MCAP eligible.

The report said Mr. Silver also contacted Mike McNair, who is described on his LinkedIn profile as a senior policy adviser in the PMO. The PMO told The Globe on Friday that Mr. McNair was a volunteer policy adviser earlier this year and has been in a paid position since June 15. Before his period of volunteering, Mr. McNair was a senior staff member in the PMO for several years.

A source confirmed to The Globe that Mr. Silver contacted Liberal officials about the pandemic relief wage subsidy. The rules were not changed for MCAP.

The Prime Minister’s Office told The Globe earlier this month that Ms. Telford voluntarily established an ethics screen after Mr. Silver joined MCAP to ensure she is not part of any discussions about the company, even though the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner told her it was not necessary. The PMO repeated that on Friday in response to the new details, saying the screen has been “diligently followed.”

“Ms. Telford has not been involved in any discussions related to MCAP. The Prime Minister’s Office takes all its obligations regarding ethics very seriously and follows the rules,” the office said.

Pierre-Olivier Herbert, who was director of communications to Mr. Morneau, provided a statement on Friday that did not directly respond to questions about whether Mr. Silver contacted the minister’s office.

“Our office interacts regularly with a broad range of stakeholders to answer questions on government programs, including the wage subsidy. These discussions are always done in full respect of the rules in place,” he said in an e-mail. “Any report of any interaction that could be described as pressure is completely false.”

Mr. Morneau on Monday announced his resignation from politics to campaign for the leadership of the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development.

A spokesperson for MCAP said the company follows the lobbying commissioner’s guidelines.

“MCAP, through counsel, consulted with Canada’s Lobbying Commissioner in January to establish proper screens and protocols around any engagement with government. MCAP and its employees and officers have strictly complied with the letter and spirit of this guidance and all applicable laws,” the company stated.

Mr. Silver was registered to lobby the federal government before the Liberals came to power in 2015. At the time, he worked for the lobbying firm Crestview Strategy Inc., representing corporate clients, including Coca-Cola, Target Canada and the Canadian Gaming Association.

After the Liberals formed the government in 2015 and Ms. Telford was named chief of staff, Mr. Silver announced he would no longer be an employee or shareholder of Crestview Strategy. He said he was leaving to ensure Ms. Telford’s success.

“I decided that me remaining an employee or shareholder in a government relations firm that does federal work while my spouse is in her current job is inconsistent with this objective,” he said in a statement at the time. He is not currently registered as a lobbyist.

Mr. Silver’s contacts with political staff about the wage subsidy are separate from a Globe report earlier this month that the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC), an independent Crown corporation, awarded MCAP a $56-million contract to administer the federal government’s Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program. The contract was signed on May 15. The program was extended in July, meaning the total value could reach $84-million.

The Globe reported that Mr. Silver took part in a June 22 meeting with CMHC regarding the public reporting of the program’s application numbers. The Prime Minister announced the rent assistance program in April.

NDP ethics critic Charlie Angus said in an interview the new report is disturbing and should be investigated.

Conservative MP Dan Albas said in an e-mail that Parliament, which is prorogued, deserves answers on what happened.

“What we have seen during Trudeau’s summer of scandal is that Liberal insiders have repeatedly used the pandemic for their own gain,” he said.

Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is defending his choice to shut down Parliament shortly before unveiling a $37-billion plan to replace a key emergency aid benefit.

Ottawa announced new measures Thursday to support Canadians who have lost income or employment due to the COVID-19 pandemic – or need to stay off work for illness or caregiving – as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit winds down.

That includes benefits that must be introduced in legislation – something that cannot happen until Parliament resumes late next month.

Story continues below advertisement

Speaking in Brockville, Ont., on Friday, Trudeau said his government wanted to take the time to get this plan right and argued that a new direction by the Liberal minority government needs to be supported by a confidence vote.

But he also said opposition parties will have the opportunity to voice any disagreement with the proposed income-support measures through debate in the House of Commons when MPs return to Ottawa in late September.

“I think Canadians can be confident when they look across party lines that everyone seems serious about supporting Canadians. There’s different approaches on how to do it, different perspectives on how much to do, but I think Canadians have seen from us that we will always be there for Canadians, we will have your backs, we will be there to support, whatever it takes,” he said.

“Other parties might not believe that, might not agree with that and I’m sure there will be important debates around that and I encourage those and welcome them.”

The new support measures announced Thursday outline what the Liberals intend for the four million workers currently receiving the $500-a-week CERB, which is set to wind down starting next month.

The CERB will be extended another four weeks, and a new benefit that pays $400 a week for up to 26 weeks will replace it for those ineligible for employment insurance, such as contract, self-employed and “gig” economy workers.

Anyone eligible for EI will get the same minimum for at least 26 weeks but will need reduced weeks of work to qualify, since many have found employment difficult to find during the pandemic.

There will also be $500-a-week sickness benefit and caregiving benefit. Changes are also coming to allow people to keep more of their benefits while they’re working.

Conservative MPs Pierre Poilievre and Dan Albas said they believe it’s unacceptable the proposal was announced after Trudeau prorogued Parliament.

“Canadians have serious questions about this transition and how it will affect them. They deserve transparency and clear answers,” they said in a joint statement.

Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet warned Trudeau on Thursday against “holding workers and businesses hostage” to the throne speech being adopted.

With Parliament set resume Sept. 23 with a speech from the throne, this leaves only a few days for legislative debate before the CERB expires, placing pressure on opposition parties to pass the legislation needed to ensure some of these new measures are adopted.

On Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland dismissed suggestions the government is forcing opposition parties get on side with government quickly, lest Canadians be left without benefits.

She argued that giving all members of Parliament the right to vote on whether they support the measures is the “democratic approach.”

Trudeau echoed this sentiment Friday.

“If the other parties disagree with extending the CERB or getting people on EI, they need to say that,” he said.

“There is no question that if we are to set off on this bold new direction for our country, we need to check in with Parliament, that’s part of our democracy and I think that’s what Canadians expect.”

Trudeau was also asked about details contained in thousands of pages of documents about the WE Charity affair released by the Liberal government earlier this week.

In one April 20 e-mail, assistant deputy minister for finance Michelle Kovacevic makes reference to the Prime Minister’s Office “weighing in” on the proposed student volunteer program, which also mentioned “positive communication with WE to be a partner,” although she also added no agreement had yet been made.

Story continues below advertisement

Trudeau said Friday he stood by his earlier statement that he only learned that WE Charity had been chosen by the public service to run the Canada Student Service Grant program on May 8, and that he pushed back on the idea knowing his own and his family’s ties to the organization would come under scrutiny.

Trudeau and Bill Morneau, who resigned as finance minister Monday, are being investigated by the federal ethics commissioner for not recusing themselves from the decision to award the contract to WE, despite their close family ties to the organization. Both have apologized.

WE backed out of the deal in early July, citing the controversy surrounding the program."

The federal Conservatives will announce the winner of their leadership race on Sunday. Most everyone expects either Peter MacKay, a former senior cabinet minister and co-founder of the party, or Durham MP Erin O’Toole will lead the party. But in one sense, that won’t tell us much at all.

Mr. MacKay and Mr. O’Toole have broadly similar platforms. (Cut taxes, control spending, fight crime, support the military.) Both are middle-aged white men. Melissa Lantsman, who had various roles in Stephen Harper’s Conservative government and who helped run Ontario Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford’s election campaign, calls them “two sides of the same Conservative coin.”

During the leadership campaign, neither of them confronted the core question: What does Canadian conservatism mean in our time? What defines the Conservative Party of Canada? And why should the millennials, who when combined with Gen Z are now by far the largest voting block in the country, support it?

The answer emerging from some of the best minds in the conservative movement, and from the dynamics of the leadership campaign itself, will confound many small-c conservatives, including this writer, who believe in fiscal conservatism but progressive social policies.

The Conservatives may need to do the exact opposite. Electoral success amid the insecurities of today may lie in embracing a responsible version of social conservatism, and in recognizing that the Conservative Party must be, at its heart, populist.

The federal Conservatives have a large base. About 30 per cent of the electorate, consisting primarily of voters in the Prairies and in rural Ontario and British Columbia, will vote Conservative no matter the circumstances, no matter the leader, come hell or high water, according to most polls and most election results. No other federal party has a base that large and that loyal. But the Tories also have a low ceiling – the party has never won the support of more than 40 per of the vote in any election since the current incarnation was formed in 2003.

Conservative election strategy has been to win over a few percentage points of persuadable voters above the base by offering this tax cut or that tough-on-crime proposal.

The approach failed in the 2019 election because Conservative strategists and the party’s leader, Andrew Scheer, were trying to recreate the electoral coalition that brought former prime minister Stephen Harper three victories, including a majority government in 2011, not realizing that the coalition no longer exists.

“They’re stuck using the Stephen Harper playbook,” says David Tarrant, who was a communications strategist in both the Harper and Ford governments. “They are not responding to the fact that the country is always changing, and politics is always changing.”

A decade ago, the millennials – which the Washington-based Pew Research Center defines as anyone born between 1981 and 1996 – emerged as a voting block.

Today they and Gen Z, the generation behind them, form a larger congregation of voters than either the boomers or Generation X.

Progressive parties – the New Democrats and Greens, as well as the Liberals – believe they own and will always own the millennial and Gen Z vote, because these younger voters are more socially liberal than their parents.

But the Great Recession of 2008-09, advances in new technologies and the ongoing concentration of wealth within a privileged elite have left many younger workers struggling in a gig economy that was shattered by the arrival of COVID-19.

Justin Trudeau clearly believes that these voters, many of whom currently depend on CERB (the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit) and other federal emergency wage and job supports to get by, will welcome more government support.

“This is our chance to build a more resilient Canada, a Canada that is healthier and safer, greener and more competitive, a Canada that is more welcoming and more fair,” the Prime Minister said at Tuesday’s press conference.

To Ian Brodie, who was chief of staff to Mr. Harper in his first government, Mr. Trudeau’s remarks smack of class warfare. The Liberals, he tweeted after that press conference, “will speak to people who weren’t terribly badly inconvenienced by the shutdown, promising to use other people’s money to remake Canada in a way they describe as fairer and greener.” Conservatives, he said, “speaking for people who paid a terrible price in the shutdown, will talk primarily about recovering jobs, business income, schooling and normalcy.”

The divisions are not only income-based, but geographical as well. If the Conservatives dominate in the Prairie provinces and the hinterlands, the natural habitat of Liberals is in the more affluent enclaves of the larger cities, especially Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver.

The two sides fight for votes in the scores of suburban ridings in between these two solitudes. Because there are so many of them, suburban ridings determine the outcome of elections.

Another division could be between the public class, who live on the avails of taxation, and the private class, who pay the taxes. The public class includes the school teacher, transit worker, public servant, nurse, student, artist, social worker, first responder, city worker and the like. Most of them would welcome a further expansion of the state, which would benefit their class.

The private class includes the store clerk, store owner, accountant, factory worker, office manager, salesperson, truck driver, marketer, oil worker and others trying to hang on to their job and as much of their money as possible.

“You have to identify the segments of the population who feel left behind by the downtown elites,” says Ms. Lantsman. “You’ve got to identify the people who are left behind and make sure you’re taking care of them.”

The key for Conservatives is to convince younger workers in insecure jobs – the Precariat, some call them – that the Conservative Party is their party, not the party of the fat cats in the board rooms, where Liberals are more likely to be found.

For that reason, conservative parties across Canada have been most successful when they embrace what you might call “controlled populism.” Successful Conservative governments are in it “for the little guy,” as Mr. Ford puts it. But being in it for the little guy doesn’t mean subsidies and supports: For conservatives, it means private-sector job creation and greater social mobility.

Social mobility focuses on helping people get an education, get a first job, get a better job, buy a home, raise a family – not through subsidies and supports, but by creating the economic conditions that make mobility possible.

Promoting social mobility is the very core of modern conservatism for Sean Speer, who was Mr. Harper’s senior economic adviser and is today a fellow at the Public Policy Forum, an Ottawa-based think tank.

“It’s a message that is inclusive,” he says.

And it contrasts, he said, with the Liberals, who are “so focused on income redistribution, which is so static, so fixed-pie, that there is a whole caste system and the purpose of government is to redistribute from those who are successful to those who aren’t successful.”

Controlled populism also accepts the need for immigrants to grow the population and power the Canadian economy. Support for robust levels of immigration distinguishes Canadian populism from its darker counterpart in the United States and Europe. In 2018, Mr. Ford’s Progressive Conservatives won most of the ridings with high levels of immigrant voters.

As for the New Democrats, who claim to represent the economically marginalized, Ms. Lantsman dismisses them as the “Lost Party of the Woke Torontonian,” long divorced from the labourers and farmers who were their original supporters. NDP partisans would hotly disagree. But the truth is that, with only 16 per cent of the vote in the last election, and with the party’s finances in dire straits, the party of Tommy Douglas and Ed Broadbent and Jack Layton has never seemed to matter less. Future elections may involve, not just Liberal-Conservative or Liberal-NDP switch voters, but NDP-Conservative switchers. It already happens in the West; it could come to Ontario as well.

Many Conservatives believe that, however fiscally conservative, the party must be socially moderate: must accept a woman’s right to choose an abortion, must defend LGBTQ rights. Andrew Scheer’s visible discomfort when queried on such issues contributed to his defeat in the 2019 election.

But the strength of Toronto lawyer Leslyn Lewis’s campaign has surprised many. She is pro-life and opposes legislation that would ban conversion therapy on LBGTQ people. But she also has a PhD in Law and a Masters in environmental science. She is expected to come in a strong third and could even place second. Everyone agrees that MP Derek Sloan, another social conservative, will place last.

As a black woman, she caters to “the desire within the party itself to break out of the stereotype of the Conservatives being a party of white men,” says pollster Dimitri Pantazopoulos.

Story continues below advertisement

But the success of Ms. Lewis’s campaign also suggests that Conservatives can no longer pretend that social conservatism is a fringe element within the movement.

“It doesn’t mean you have to agree with them,” said Mr. Pantazopoulos. “But it does mean you have to listen to them, accept that their point is valid and that they need to be heard.”

Ms. Lewis, who was virtually unknown when she entered the Conservative leadership race in February, raised almost as much money as Mr. MacKay and Mr. O’Toole in the last quarter, and beat them both in the number of donors, with more than 10,000 people contributing.

How does the next Conservative leader account for the undeniable power of social conservatives within the party without alienating voters, especially younger voters, who would reject – probably for a lifetime – any party that sought to limit the rights of women or of LGBTQ Canadians?

One way to bridge the gap might be to focus on the fundamental importance of the family as the foundation of Canadian society: making it easier to afford being a couple and to have children – perhaps through income splitting – and to care for older relatives.

As Mr. Speer puts it: “If you get married, find work, buy a house and have kids, your likelihood of living in poverty is basically nil.”

Provincial governments have the task of providing the services that Canadians depend on – education, health care, roads and public transit, and the like. Most provinces – including all three Prairie provinces, two Maritime provinces and Ontario and Quebec – currently have conservative governments of one sort or another, which suggests Canadians are comfortable with governments of the centre-right.

The popularity of provincial conservatives gives hope to federal Conservatives. As well, the WE Charity controversy and the resignation of former finance minister Bill Morneau have damaged Mr. Trudeau and his government. Canadians may not warm to the Liberals’ bold plans for new spending, with the deficit approaching a staggering $350-billion this year and with more to come next year.

A well-run campaign and a thoughtful platform based on a return to fiscal responsibility, private-sector job creation, support for elder care as well as child care, continued robust immigration – with a greater emphasis on economic-class over family-class immigrants – help for the agriculture and natural resource sector – especially for oil and gas – improved education and entrepreneurial opportunities for First Nations, help for car commuters, and promises to co-operate with rather than confront provinces in fighting climate change, could go down well.

Beyond presenting a coherent vision of conservatism that will appeal to young and suburban voters, Mr. O’Toole or Mr. MacKay must bring something more valued this year than at any time in the past: authenticity.

“It’s not something you can build or manufacture,” says Howard Anglin. Mr. Anglin is principal secretary to Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, but for the purposes of this essay he speaks only for himself.

Even before the pandemic struck, there were signs that voters were growing increasingly impatient with the scripted message tracks that dominate political discourse. COVID-19 heightened the demand from politicians for straight, honest answers to fair questions. Many politicians did their best, from François Legault in Quebec to John Horgan in B.C.

Ottawa is still trapped in the same-old, same-old. Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives routinely call the Liberals corrupt and incompetent. Compared to past Canadian governments, and many other governments in the developed world, they are neither.

But Mr. Trudeau also plays the old game. Unlike Mr. Ford or Saskatchewan’s Scott Moe – or, for that matter Germany’s Angela Merkel, or New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern – Mr. Trudeau speaks with words that everyone knows are studiously crafted, scraped of meaning, and sometimes less than entirely true. The next Conservative leader has an opportunity to connect with voters by being “a lot less scripted, a lot less calculating, a lot less political, a lot more human,” as Mr. Anglin put it.

Will Peter MacKay or Erin O’Toole manage the feat? If so, whoever wins Sunday could be the next prime minister.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined Ontario Premier Doug Ford on Friday to announce a deal aimed at ensuring Canada is never again at the mercy of unreliable foreign suppliers of personal protective equipment during a pandemic.

Under the agreement, 3M Canada will increase capacity at its Brockville, Ont., facility so it can eventually produce up to 100 million medical-grade N95 masks a year.

“This is part of our made-in-Canada plan to find solutions to COVID-19,” Mr. Trudeau said at the plant in Brockville, where he unveiled the plan alongside Mr. Ford, representatives from both governments and 3M executives.

The first deliveries of the N95 respirators, which have been in high demand worldwide since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, will come early next year.

That means they will not be in place in time for a potential second wave of the novel coronavirus, but Mr. Trudeau said the investment is about being ready for the future.

“We also want to make sure that we have N95 masks at our disposal if we are ever faced with another public-health crisis in the years to come,” Mr. Trudeau said in French.

The federal and Ontario governments, which are each kicking in $23.3-million to help increase production capacity at the plant, will each receive 25 million masks a year over five years for health care and other essential workers.

Mr. Ford said Ontario needed to ramp up production of personal protective equipment given the experience early in the COVID-19 crisis, when Canada was scrambling in a global competition for a limited supply of masks and other equipment.

“This will never, ever happen to us again,” the Premier said Friday.

The prized N95 respirator masks, used by front-line health care workers, were in particularly short supply.

Millions of the respirators Canada obtained from China were found to be defective and couldn’t be used. In the early weeks of the pandemic, they were even at risk of being blocked by U.S. President Donald Trump, who called out 3M after learning the Minnesota-based company had been exporting N95 masks to Canada and Mexico.

The company pushed back, warning that backing out of existing export agreements at a time of crisis would have serious humanitarian consequences and would ultimately result in fewer masks being available in the United States.

Eventually, the company agreed to bring masks in from its foreign plants, and exemptions were carved out to allow exports to Canada to continue.

This is the second domestic contract to produce N95 masks, after Quebec-based Medicom signed a 10-year agreement to supply N95 and surgical masks to the federal government in April.

Medicom’s combined contracts are worth more than $113-million, and include providing 24 million surgical masks and 20 million N95 respirators each year.

The company turned a warehouse in Montreal into a mask factory in a little more than two months. It has already started producing and supplying surgical masks to Ottawa and N95 production is to begin this month with the first deliveries expected in the fall.

Ottawa is appealing a court ruling that struck down a key agreement on refugees between Canada and the United States, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said Friday.

The Federal Court of Canada ruled last month that elements of the law underpinning the pact violate the constitutional guarantee of life, liberty and security.

The declaration of invalidity was suspended for six months, leaving the law in place until mid-January.

Under the Safe Third Country Agreement, which took effect in 2004, Canada and the U.S. recognize each other as safe places to seek protection.

It means Canada can turn back potential refugees who arrive at land ports of entry along the Canada-U.S. border on the basis they must pursue their claims in the U.S., the country where they first arrived.

In a statement, Mr. Blair said Friday there are factual and legal errors in some of the Federal Court’s key findings. “There are important legal principles to be determined in this case, and it is the responsibility of the Government of Canada to appeal to ensure clarity on the legal framework governing asylum law.”

Canadian refugee advocates have firmly opposed the deal, arguing the U.S. is not always a safe country for people fleeing persecution.

Several refugee claimants took the case to court along with the Canadian Council for Refugees, the Canadian Council of Churches and Amnesty International, which participated in the proceedings as public interest parties.

In each case, the applicants, who are citizens of El Salvador, Ethiopia and Syria, arrived at a Canadian land entry port from the U.S. and sought refugee protection.

They argued in court that by returning ineligible refugee claimants to the U.S., Canada exposes them to risks in the form of detention and other rights violations.

In her decision, Federal Court Justice Ann Marie McDonald concluded that the Safe Third Country Agreement results in ineligible claimants being imprisoned by U.S. authorities.

Detention and the consequences flowing from it are “inconsistent with the spirit and objective” of the refugee agreement and amount to a violation of the rights guaranteed by Section 7 of the charter, she wrote.

“The evidence clearly demonstrates that those returned to the U.S. by Canadian officials are detained as a penalty.”

The public interest parties who took part in the case immediately called on the federal government to stop sending people back to the U.S. under the agreement and to not appeal the court decision.

In his statement, Mr. Blair said the agreement with the U.S. “remains a comprehensive vehicle” to uphold a compassionate, fair and orderly refugee protection system, based on the principle that people should claim asylum in the first safe country in which they arrive.

Canada “continues to engage actively” with Washington on the refugee pact, ensuring the agreement reflects Canada’s commitment to its international obligations, “while continuously co-operating on how we manage our shared border,” he added.

Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press

Whoever wins the Conservative leadership contest this weekend could find themselves running to become Prime Minister in a matter of months – if not weeks. As Justin Trudeau’s minority Liberal government faltered under the weight of WE controversy and the sudden departure of Finance Minister Bill Morneau, the Prime Minister asked for the House of Commons to be prorogued until late September. When Parliament returns, the Speech from the Throne will lead to a confidence vote and, potentially, an election.

Even if an election doesn’t come soon, the next Conservative leader will take over during a tumultuous time in Ottawa. As Mr. Trudeau turns his attention to economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Conservatives will seek to assert themselves as the country’s voice of fiscal discipline.

Against this backdrop, Conservatives cast their mail-in ballots for the next leader of their party. The winner will be announced Sunday night, with former cabinet minister Peter MacKay and MP Erin O’Toole positioned as frontrunners. Campaign staff for both men expect it to be a close race, but also expressed surprise at the fundraising prowess of Leslyn Lewis (A fourth candidate, MP Derek Sloan, is also running).

Conservative leadership ballot-counting delayed by high turnout, machine malfunctions

Ibbitson: Will MacKay or O’Toole lead the Conservatives? It doesn’t matter – not as much as what the party does next

The first mission for the next leader will be challenging the Liberal government over its decision to grant a $543.5-million contract to WE Charity, which was then cancelled amid conflict-of-interest allegations involving Mr. Trudeau. After the appointment of Chrystia Freeland as Mr. Morneau’s replacement, the Prime Minister asked the Governor-General to prorogue Parliament until Sept. 23.

When the House of Commons returns, the Liberal government will present a Speech from the Throne and provide a vote of confidence on their new plan. If he wins the leadership, Mr. O’Toole, a sitting MP, will be positioned in the front bench of the House when Parliament resumes; Mr. MacKay would need to offer his critique of the government from outside the chamber until he can win a seat of his own.

How do you tell them apart?

Peter MacKay and Erin O’Toole do not differ significantly on policy, but have run markedly different campaigns, with Mr. MacKay leaning into his progressive roots and Mr. O’Toole embracing the legacy of former prime minister Stephen Harper.

“I think, stylistically, they’ve differed,” said Conservative strategist Tim Powers, the vice-chairman of Summa Strategies. “Substantively, they’ve had some differences, but this hasn’t been a leadership race where policy has been a great divide. … There was none of that in this campaign.”

While Mr. O’Toole and Mr. MacKay are both pro-choice and support gay marriage, the former appears to have drawn a distinction between himself and his opponent. Mr. O’Toole’s positioned himself as the “True Blue” candidate, suggesting perhaps Mr. MacKay is less Conservative than him.

Mr. O’Toole has repeatedly called to “Take Back Canada.” His website says “We are in a battle for the soul of the Conservative party,” calling it a contest about whether the party “becomes more like the Liberals or one that believes we win when we take a principled conservative stand.”

The contender considers himself “the natural inheritor of the Harper Party, changing with the times and my leadership style will be different, but I have many of the same principles as Stephen Harper.” He added: “Peter MacKay was the PC leader 17 years ago and I’m not sure we have to go back in time for a leader in 2020.”

Mr. O’Toole has run a pointed, virtually gaffe-free campaign with a carefully crafted message. He attempted to court the votes of social conservatives, whose first choice may be Ms. Lewis or Mr. Sloan. In a leaked video obtained by Radio-Canada, Mr. O’Toole told social conservatives in Quebec that he is concerned about proposed legislation to ban conversion therapy and legislation that would broaden access to medically assisted dying. Mr. O’Toole responded to the story on Twitter, saying in French that conversion therapies “do not have a place in Canada and should be abolished,” and said in another tweet that he is committed to fighting the practice of conversion therapy.

Political commentators have observed that Mr. O’Toole’s campaign has not reflected his reputation as a moderate voice within the party. Mr. O’Toole said he has read that analysis and finds it “amusing” because many of the policies he put forward are repeated from the last leadership race, when he placed third and lost to Andrew Scheer.

“I am much more worried about the state of the country, both from a national unity perspective and from an economic perspective. So I’m being far more tough and strong … my language is a little stronger, no question about it,” Mr. O’Toole said.

Jamie Ellerton, principal at Conaptus, and a former manager of media relations on Mr. Scheer’s election campaign tour, called Mr. O’Toole a “really nice guy” who has shown through Zoom meetings his knowledge of policy, but said his “True Blue” style has “felt performative.”

“He’s clearly thought with his team that this is the strategy they need to win. But I think his authenticity suffered as a result,” Mr. Ellerton said.

In an interview, Mr. MacKay said he believes there are “different shades of Blue,” but all are Conservatives. Then, he pointed out, he co-founded the Conservative Party and so he has always been “somebody associated with unity.”

Story continues below advertisement

And yet, Mr. MacKay’s campaign was marred by divisive comments made even before he was a candidate. Before the leadership race was under way, Mr. MacKay told a panel in Washington that Andrew Scheer lost the election because his socially conservative views on abortion and same-sex marriage hung around his neck “like a stinking albatross.” Mr. MacKay has since said he regrets the way his comments were interpreted.

“Let me address the albatross in the room,” Mr. MacKay said in his interview with The Globe. He said he tried “perhaps awkwardly and perhaps too soon, to defend Andrew Scheer,” insisting he was talking about the way Mr. Scheer was treated during the campaign rather than criticizing the leader’s policies themselves.

Mr. MacKay acknowledged the criticism of his word choice, much of which was hurled by his chief opponent. Mr. O’Toole told The Globe that when he launched his campaign, he wanted to ensure “all Conservatives were not only welcome but respected within our party. Very much a totally different approach to Mr. MacKay and his albatross comments out of the gate. That really, really hurt people within the party, just that approach.”

In addition, Mr. MacKay blamed his team after a tweet sent from his account attacked the Prime Minister for expensing $876.95 in yoga and spa sessions while running for Liberal Party leader. Mr. MacKay later told the CBC he wanted to “keep the tone civilized” and had expressed that to his supporters.

Mr. Ellerton said Mr. MacKay’s online presence and social-media gaffes had people “turning their heads,” but those missteps decreased as the campaign progressed. Mr. MacKay proved himself, especially in the debates, to be an effective communicator, according to Mr. Ellerton.

Both Mr. MacKay and Mr. O’Toole say that “experience” is the differentiating factor between the two of them. Mr. MacKay touted his time serving in Stephen Harper’s cabinet in high profile portfolios such as defence, justice and foreign affairs. Mr. O’Toole said he has more real-life experience, having spent 12 years in the military and 10 years in the private sector as a lawyer.

Common Ground

On paper, Mr. O’Toole and Mr. MacKay are not all that different on key issues. On the economy, they both pledge to review the tax code and reverse a tax increase for small businesses. They emphasize the importance of creating jobs and bolstering the economy.

Mr. MacKay and Mr. O’Toole have vowed to be tough on China and promise to ban Huawei from Canada’s 5G networks. Mr. MacKay said he would apply “maximum pressure” with respect to the arbitrary detention of Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in China. He would look at the imposition of Magnitsky sanctions, which impose asset freezes and travel bans on human-rights abusers, and broaden Canada’s trade in the region away from China.

Mr. O’Toole would also use Magnitsky sanctions if the two Canadians were not returned within 30 days, seek out new trading markets for Canadian exporters, and stand up against how China behaves toward Uyghurs, a minority group, and the people of Hong Kong.

On the environment, both candidates oppose the federal carbon tax. Their environmental policies share some similarities, such as transitioning away from coal to natural gas and investing in technology. But Mr. O’Toole’s plan proposes “making industry pay” by forging a national industrial regulatory and pricing regime. He also proposes simplifying the tax code to support the resource sector and its actions toward reducing emissions and exporting modern and safe nuclear technology.

Winning the next election

To attract new supporters to his party, Mr. O’Toole said he will reach out to suburban and urban Canadians, such as professional women in the Greater Toronto Area, and show that he is committed to human rights and women’s rights as well as providing a strong economy for families and safe communities.

“I will be able to make sure that the Conservative Party has a policy, set of plans, for any issues that Canadians want to hear from us on, whether it’s the environment, climate change, whether it’s Indigenous reconciliation,” Mr. O’Toole said.

Mr. MacKay said his team is going to focus on being competitive in every region and that national unity and job creation are his priorities. He also said that as a Toronto resident, he understands the specific issues that are important to people in the city such as housing, transportation and employment.

“It’s going to be incumbent upon us to be very active, in not just criticizing, but contrasting and saying how we would do it differently,” Mr. MacKay said.

Mr. Ellerton said the next leader and the party has to translate “frustration with Justin Trudeau into something constructive, as opposed to just being an outrage machine.”

The next leader will have to “torch some of the tried and true talking points” used by the party in past elections, according to Mr. Powers. “The imitation of Stephen Harper’s approach may flatter Conservative supporters but it won’t win over enough Canadians to form government,” he said.

Leslyn Lewis

Ms. Lewis has raised close to $2-million and attracted supporters, despite the fact that she’s not as well known as her rivals and has had relatively little experience in politics. A lawyer from Toronto, Ms. Lewis has a masters in Environmental Studies and a PhD in Law. She is the first Black woman to run for the leadership of the Conservative Party. Ms. Lewis ran unsuccessfully as a Conservative candidate in 2015, filling in last minute after a candidate was dropped from the campaign.

Ms. Lewis told The Globe that she has been able to stand out in the race because she has “always had a knack for listening to what people were concerned about.” She said the party’s policies have been “abstract” and that they don’t relate to people.

Ms. Lewis said she stands for fundamental freedoms, ensuring democracy is intact and uniting the country. She is particularly concerned about the country’s increasing deficit. Ms. Lewis declares on her website that she is tired of seeing the Liberals accuse the Conservatives of having a “hidden agenda” particularly on social issues such as abortion. She wrote that she would advocate for anti-abortion policies.

Derek Sloan

Mr. Sloan, a lawyer, is the member of Parliament for Hastings-Lennox and Addington in eastern Ontario. Mr. Sloan’s campaign did not respond to interview requests from The Globe. He calls himself a “Conservative without apology,” on his website. In April, Mr. Sloan refused to apologize after questioning Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam’s loyalty to the country, asking in a Facebook video: “Does she work for Canada or for China?” He later said his comments were “deliberately” mischaracterized by the Liberals. He’s also said he is “100-per-cent opposed” to requiring Canadians to take a coronavirus vaccine or ones for other illnesses. He said being required to wear a mask in public “isn’t about science or law, it’s about control and compliance” on Twitter.

The Ballot

Conservative members voted on a ranked ballot, marking their preferred candidates from one to four. After the first round, the candidate with the fewest first-choice points is dropped and their second choice is allocated to the remaining candidates. It is not required, though, to rank all four candidates, so some members could choose to rank one, two or three candidates, which would result in subsequent rounds with fewer votes cast.

In the 2017 leadership race, Andrew Scheer narrowly defeated Maxime Bernier – with 50.95 per cent of points to Mr. Bernier’s 49.05 – on the 13th ballot. Mr. Scheer’s success was propelled largely by social conservatives. This race is expected to be similarly close.

Fundraising

Mr. MacKay has raised significantly more than his opponents, with nearly $3.1-million in donations. Mr. O’Toole’s campaign raised $2.5-million, Ms. Lewis’ team said late Thursday that they passed the $2-million mark and Mr. Sloan has raised $852,000. The fundraising data come from two interim reports filed with Elections Canada earlier this month.

The Liberal government announced $37-billion in new income-support measures Thursday as it drastically eased eligibility rules for employment insurance, offering coverage for the underemployed that extends well into 2021.

Ottawa outlined how it will transition people off the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which provides $500 a week to people whose employment was significantly affected by COVID-19. CERB proved to be the most substantial federal support measure related to the pandemic, paying out $68.5-billion as of earlier this month to 8.6 million applicants.

The government said Thursday that CERB eligibility will extend for one additional month, allowing maximum coverage of 28 weeks. CERB will end Sept. 26 and its extension will cost about $8-billion.

After that, workers needing further support will have the option of applying to a temporarily revised EI program or one of three new income-support programs related to the pandemic.

The transition plan was announced during a tumultuous week in Ottawa. Bill Morneau resigned as finance minister and member of Parliament on Monday, with Chrystia Freeland taking the helm of his department Tuesday. The Globe reported this week that the Prime Minister’s Office and Mr. Morneau’s team had squabbled over the size and scope of federal support programs.

As part of Tuesday’s shakeup, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prorogued Parliament until Sept. 23, saying he needed a Throne Speech to outline a longer-term economic recovery plan and confidence vote. The move raises the possibility of an election, and also shuts down committee investigations into the Liberal government’s WE Charity controversy.

Thursday’s announcement was the first delivered by Ms. Freeland as Finance Minister, and she was accompanied by Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough.

“Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many workers have lost their jobs or worked greatly reduced hours, which might make them ineligible for EI. We recognize that, so we’re going to make it easier for Canadians to get EI support,” Ms. Freeland said.

“Let’s be clear: We have had some success at flattening the curve of the pandemic. But we’re not out of the woods yet.”

The EI program is subject to several temporary changes lasting one year from Sept. 27.

Story continues below advertisement

To qualify for regular EI benefits, which are tapped after a job loss, recipients will now need at least 120 hours of insurable work over the previous year. (Under prepandemic rules, it was at least 420 to 700 hours, depending on a claimant’s local unemployment rate.) There is now a floor of $400 in weekly benefits, and minimum coverage of at least 26 weeks.

The government says this lower threshold of 120 hours is meant to address the fact that the pandemic has prevented many Canadians from accumulating the number of insurable hours normally required to access the program.

“There is a clear logic in temporarily reducing qualifying hours given the disruption to work patterns that the pandemic has created,” Brian DePratto, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a client note.

In other quarters, the reduction was criticized. “This is just too low a bar and will serve as a disincentive for many part-time workers to return to their pre-COVID employment,” Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said in a statement.

As before, benefit recipients are required to be looking for work. Recipients may accept some work while maintaining some of their benefits. The provision reduces EI benefits by 50 cents for each dollar of earnings, up to 90 per cent of previous weekly earnings.

The EI program is normally paid for by payroll premiums collected from workers and employers. The government said it intends to freeze existing premiums at current levels for two years.

Beyond EI, there were a host of other changes for those needing financial support.

The new Canada Recovery Benefit is for workers who are self-employed or are not eligible for EI and cannot resume work. It will provide $400 a week for up to 26 weeks. Workers will need to repay 50 cents of every dollar earned above an annual net income of $38,000 through their income tax return.

The Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit is for workers who are ill or who must self-isolate for reasons related to COVID-19, providing $500 a week for up to two weeks.

“If you get COVID – and trust me, I did – it’s something that lasts longer than two weeks and is quite debilitating,” said Miles Corak, an economics professor at the City University of New York and formerly of the University of Ottawa, who researches the Canadian labour market and social supports. “So you wonder why they limited it so much.”

The Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit is for workers who are unable to work because they are caring for a child, dependent or family member because schools or daycares are closed owing to COVID-19, and provides $500 a week for up to 26 weeks per household.

The three new programs are expected to cost $22-billion and the expansion of EI benefits is projected to cost $7-billion, bringing the total cost to $37-billion, including the one-month CERB extension.

As of July, roughly 55 per cent of three million jobs lost between February and April had been recouped, and the unemployment rate stood at 10.9 per cent. Employment is down about 1.34 million from precrisis levels.

“These are positive steps forward,” Sheila Block, senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said of Thursday’s changes. “They are giving some degree of certainty to people who are facing a great deal of uncertainty in their life.”

Ms. Qualtrough said that with 12-month rules, there are now clear options in place in the event that Canada faces another spike in COVID-19 cases. “It’s a guaranteed way that if there are outbreaks, or if there’s a second wave, that immediately these systems will be able to take in Canadians who we ask to stay at home again if it comes to that,” she said.

Conservative MPs Dan Albas and Pierre Poilievre said in a statement that some of the measures, including incentives to accept available work, should have been adopted months ago. They also noted the legislation won’t be introduced and debated for weeks because of the decision to prorogue Parliament.

“It is unacceptable that the Trudeau government announced these changes days after locking out MPs and shutting down Parliament,” they said.

Similarly, NDP MP Daniel Blaikie said in a statement that his party is pleased to see new paid sick leave, which the NDP called for, but said the prorogation creates uncertainty.

“Because they shut down Parliament, Canadians now have to wait another month to see if what the Liberals are promising will ever actually happen,” he said.

Arouna Sissoko/The Associated Press

After two military coups in Mali in the past eight years, Canada and other key donors are being urged to reconsider their massive financial and security support for Mali’s dysfunctional government.

Soldiers seized power in the West African country on Tuesday for the second time since 2012, capitalizing on mass protests and rising discontent with a government that has failed to end years of violent insurgencies and corruption. The mutinying soldiers were greeted with jubilation in the streets of Mali’s capital, Bamako, in a clear sign that the government had lost the support of the population, despite the huge flows of international aid.

President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta announced his resignation within hours of his arrest by the rebel soldiers. The military announced plans to set up a civilian transitional government and hold elections, but the African Union decided on Wednesday to suspend Mali, while West African countries closed their land and air borders with Mali and threatened to impose sanctions on it.

Mali coup leaders promise to hold elections amid widespread condemnation

Mali’s President resigns hours after rebel soldiers detain leaders

Canada is one of Mali’s biggest foreign supporters, providing a total of about $1.6-billion in development aid over the past 20 years, along with hundreds of military peacekeepers and police trainers. Other countries, including France, have sent thousands of soldiers and military vehicles to fight Islamist radicals.

The aid, however, has failed to end the violent conflict that has devastated the country. A report this month by United Nations’ experts found that senior army and intelligence officials in Mali are deliberately obstructing a 2015 peace agreement, allowing the violence to continue.

Over the past year alone, Canada provided about $140-million in development aid to Mali, deployed troops and police officers to the country, spent millions of dollars on peace and stabilization programs and wrapped up a 12-month peacekeeping mission in northern Mali that included helicopters and hundreds of military personnel. Canadian mining companies have also invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Mali.

About 10 Canadian military officers are currently stationed at the headquarters of the UN peacekeeping mission in Bamako, and there are no plans to evacuate them, according to Captain Gregory Cutten, a public-affairs officer for the Canadian Armed Forces.

The international aid has been criticized as excessively focused on military security, neglecting the crucial issues of governance that determine whether Mali’s political leaders can maintain public support.

“If you can’t get the governance right, you are really frittering away the money you are sending there,” said Fen Hampson, professor of international affairs at Carleton University in Ottawa.

Inside the Canadian government, there are signs that Ottawa agrees with the criticism. A Canadian official said the international community – including Canada – needs to spend more on governance in Mali rather than just counterinsurgency. The Globe and Mail is not identifying the official because they were not authorized to speak publicly on Mali.

The official agreed that the massive aid has helped Mali’s government to avoid demands for reform. The UN mission in Mali must do a better job of helping the government address popular grievances on issues such as policing, electricity, water and schools, the official said.

Prof. Hampson said the immediate challenge for countries such as Canada will be to hold the coup leaders to their pledge to provide free and fair elections. But in the longer term, he said, countries including Canada should be prepared to spend more on boosting Mali’s capacity to govern and meet the needs of its citizens.

“If you’re going to be engaged, you better be prepared to stay there for the long haul and not simply be doing a quick one-off because you are running for a seat on the United Nations Security Council,” Prof. Hampson told The Globe.

“It does require perhaps a more serious international effort and not just by the French who have been doing a lot of the heavy lifting.”

He said there is a tendency to see Mali “as a bit of a sinkhole” because of the billions already spent by Western countries. “It’s a long-term problem and you’re going to have lots of failure but at the end of the day you have to ask the question: ‘What is the alternative?‘ ” he said.

“The alternative – to pull back and walk away – would not just mean destabilization in Mali and continuation of problems in the north, where you have both separatist elements and Islamic jihadists. It’s the contagion that is already spreading to other parts of West Africa.”

Chris Roberts, a political scientist at the University of Calgary who specializes in Africa and peacekeeping issues, said the heavy flow of foreign aid has allowed Mali’s government to stall the political reforms and accountability measures that it badly needs.

“As most Malians on the street know, the international community is part of Mali’s fundamental political crisis: It seems to support an entrenched political class,” Mr. Roberts told The Globe.

In the years before the 2012 coup, and again in the years before the latest coup, Canada significantly expanded its aid for Mali, he said.

“Canada ramped up its bilateral aid to Mali as political malaise, corruption and security dynamics got worse,” he said.

“We ignored the direct and indirect effects of development and security assistance. Mali’s political elites face no incentives to change, to improve institutions, elections and accountability, when they know the international community will keep the financial flows coming. Until we try harder to understand how high levels of aid foster an unaccountable political system, we are part of the problem.”

Judd Devermont, director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the international community has been ignoring the political realities in Mali.

The country’s elite have reverted to patronage politics, neglecting the peace process and losing the trust of the public, he said in a commentary on Wednesday. “They have chosen to simply go through the motions,” he said.

The RCMP is examining the now-cancelled contract awarded to WE Charity by the Liberal government, the force said Wednesday, adding it will take appropriate actions as required.

In a statement, the Mounties said it would be inappropriate to comment further on the matter.

Earlier Wednesday, opposition parties said the Liberal government triggered the prorogation of Parliament to avoid accountability for newly released documents about the WE Charity agreement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked the Governor-General on Tuesday to prorogue Parliament and said a new Speech from the Throne would take place on Sept. 23 to lay out a new vision for the government.

Opposition parties do not believe Mr. Trudeau’s explanation for prorogation, noting that the timing shuts down committee investigations into the Liberal government’s WE Charity controversy.

Mr. Trudeau is hiding from the truth, Conservative MP Michael Barrett said Wednesday. “This is about one thing and one thing only,” he said.

Mr. Barrett was referring to Mr. Trudeau’s request to prorogue Parliament as MPs on the House of Commons finance committee gained access to thousands of pages of government documents on Tuesday regarding a now-cancelled $543.5-million agreement with WE Charity to administer a program for students.

The Conservatives and NDP believe the documents have also been too heavily redacted.

On Tuesday, Mr. Trudeau also named Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland as Finance Minister after Bill Morneau resigned from the portfolio on Monday. Mr. Morneau is facing an ethics probe over the agreement with the WE Charity, along with the Prime Minister.

“If this was about introducing a Speech from the Throne, the reset that he was looking for, he could have prorogued on Sept. 22 and delivered that speech on the 23rd,” Mr. Barrett said.

The effect of prorogation is regular committee work is shut down, as all bills and committee studies die.

The existing bills and committee studies are not necessarily ended for good. Procedural options exist for MPs to approve motions that would reinstate bills and studies back to the stages they were at at the time of prorogation.

Mr. Barrett said the Prime Minister would like to divert attention to the forthcoming Speech from the Throne to distract Canadians.

The speech, delivered after a general election or a prorogation, sets out the government’s view of the condition of the country and gives a sense of legislation it intends to bring forward.

Once the Speech from the Throne has been read, a vote is held that this is seen as a test of the support for the government.

“The prorogation we are doing right now is about gaining or testing the confidence of the House,” Mr. Trudeau said Tuesday.

The Conservatives are to name a new leader on Sunday in Ottawa, which will give the party little runway to have a new boss in place before this significant vote.

The federal New Democrats have also decried the prorogation of Parliament, with Leader Jagmeet Singh saying Canadians shouldn’t be forced to pay the price for Mr. Trudeau’s scandals.

The Bloc Québécois’s Rhéal Fortin also issued a statement on Wednesday demanding accountability over the agreement with WE.

For their part, the Liberals say that prorogation is simply a matter of a “reset” in response to the pandemic.

“We need to have a rethink,” Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne told The Canadian Press in Montreal on Wednesday. “This is a time where we are looking ahead.”

Mr. Trudeau said Tuesday he was not trying to prompt an election.

“It is obvious that the Throne Speech we gave eight months ago is no longer relevant for the reality that Canadians are living,” he said. “I think it is important that Canadians have a clear idea of the plan that we have for building a stronger economy that is more inclusive, that is greener, that is fairer for all Canadians.”

Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, an outspoken member of his party, said Wednesday that he liked the idea of a Throne Speech on Sept. 23 and a confidence vote on the government’s agenda.

He said while it is not the end of the world to punt committee inquiries for a few weeks, the better response would have been to prorogue in mid-September to avoid that happening.

The Canadian Press

If you were to rank a playoff series by entertainment value, you’d start at “classic,” move down to “war,” then “battle,” “skirmish,” “romp,” “entry exams for clown college” and end up at whatever the Raptors just did to the Brooklyn Nets.

It was both the most dominating Toronto has ever been over a four-game stretch, and the least watchable.

Say this much for the postseason surrenders that punctuated the DeMar DeRozan era – at least they got your blood up. But there is little joy to be had watching someone work the dunking booth with a Gatling gun.

Story continues below advertisement

Let’s hope Boston provides more of a challenge.

But before we get to that, let’s take a moment to consider what could have been.

Not for the Raptors. They’re fine. But for Kawhi Leonard. He isn’t.

We are now just over a year since Toronto’s favourite temporary resident decided he no longer wanted to pull on Sorels in order to get to work.

At the time, the reaction ran something along the lines of, “Well, if that’s what he wants, then best of luck to him.”

This had something to do with Leonard in the sense that he played his Machiavellian game so tight to the chest, you couldn’t take it personally. He hadn’t broken any promises, and didn’t toss any lit sticks of dynamite over his shoulder as he left. He went without saying anything at all.

It’s hard to be offended in a vacuum. Everyone else should take notes.

Story continues below advertisement

But that unusually – maybe even uniquely – reasonable reaction had more to do with the rest of us. We’d gotten what we wanted. Not just an NBA championship, but a chance to show America that anything they can do, we can do better. Be louder. Build more fan zones. Pat ourselves on the back for a solid month for being perfect fans (after ignoring the team for the a month before that).

The American media came north and did what Canadians love best on the international stage – gave us a good, long stroking.

“Who’s a good global citizen? Who’s the bestest friend America ever had?”

“We are!” Canada said, wagging its tail so hard it was knocking stuff off the coffee table. “We so are!”

This collective need to be acknowledged by foreign powers is neither a good nor a bad thing. But it is definitely a Canadian thing.

In any case, Leonard made that possible. So it was okay with everyone when he slapped the Raptors’ hand away and headed home. Even the Raptors wished him well (in public, at least).

Story continues below advertisement

The feeling then was that Leonard had built himself a dynasty in L.A., while Toronto was being cast down into the NBA limbo. Not bad, exactly, but not good either.

At best, a quickie rebuild. At worst, everyone gets to say they had some glory days.

And then they began playing basketball again.

As it turns out, constructing a basketball team on paper is not exactly like laying out architectural renderings for a luxury bungalow. Because while you’re building an actual house, other builders of other houses are not popping by every other night to knock your beams out of place.

Leonard’s Clippers were good enough. They’d already been good before he arrived, carrying Paul George in his tote bag. But they were not great.

They’ve continued to not be great in the bubble. In the play-in games, L.A. lost to Brooklyn, convincing some people the Nets had a puncher’s chance against the Raptors. We’ve seen how that worked out.

Story continues below advertisement

Now the Clippers are in a war – and possibly a classic – against the Dallas Mavericks.

There are two stories in that series. The first is Luka Doncic, who is becoming the Michael Jordan of his generation. And not least because two teams passed on him in the 2018 draft.

Whenever anyone tells you that the scouting process has been refined to a science by statistical analysis, the two-word rebuttal to that argument is “Marvin Bagley.”

The other story is Paul George, the Alfred to Leonard’s Batman. George has been an, ahem, peripheral presence in the series. While Doncic was repeatedly shanking L.A. in an overtime win on Sunday night, George was testing the durability of the rim by whipping balls at it as hard as he could.

L.A.-Dallas is tied at 2-2. The Clippers are still favourites. But they’ve already lost the lustre Leonard was supposed to bring – that this team is the crosstown reincarnation of Showtime.

The Clippers weren’t just supposed to win. They were supposed to do it in style. Instead, they look a little like the Raptors did last year – a scrappy team dependent on Leonard for survival.

Story continues below advertisement

Meanwhile, the Raptors don’t look better without Leonard. There is no diminishing how magnificent he was during his time in Toronto. But they do look more complete.

Shorn of their one true star, they are now a contingent of equals. Some people are more equal than others, but the injury late in Game 4 to Kyle Lowry shows by what thin margins.

Lowry is the most significant Raptor. But his potential absence with an ankle sprain has not created panic. Instead, people now think to themselves, “I guess Norm Powell has to be NORMAN POWELL for a few nights” or “Tell Fred VanVleet to turn up the volume on his game to 10.5.″

For the first time in Raptors history, you have a feel for the personality and function of seven or eight players. The bench is a second line instead of the rejects who weren’t good enough to start. For the moment, the Raptors exist outside the NBA’s star system. They’re a unit.

This makes them less sexy than the Clippers, the Lakers or even the Mavericks. It makes it harder for U.S. networks to promote them, because you can’t pin your marketing to one (preferably young) guy.

It also occasionally makes them boring to watch. Everyone loves a grinder, but not when the grinder is efficient.

Story continues below advertisement

Efficient grinding isn’t entertainment. It’s milling. But it works.

It will be interesting to see the Canadian reaction if and when Leonard’s Clippers are bounced. Is there still enough residual goodwill that people will feel bad for him? I doubt it.

That is the other effect of leaving the way Leonard did. No one hates you for it. But after a short while, no one bothers to remember you either."

Gene J. Puskar/The Associated Press

Kasperi Kapanen woke up Tuesday as a member of the Toronto Maple Leafs. A short time later he was no longer with the club for whom he had played since 2015-16.

“You hear lots of rumours,” Kapanen said during an audio call with journalists during the afternoon. “For me, it has been that way for quite some time. I was doing my thing in the morning and people were saying that I might get traded, or that I had gotten traded, and I didn’t know what to believe.”

That’s when Toronto general manager Kyle Dubas called the 24-year-old winger and told him he was on the way back to Pittsburgh. The organization had originally drafted him in 2014 in the first round.

Story continues below advertisement

A handful of others were peripherally involved in the deal, but essentially he was swapped for the Penguins’ 2020 first-round draft pick (15th over all). The Maple Leafs otherwise would not have had one because Dubas traded theirs to Carolina last summer to shed Patrick Marleau’s US$6.25-million contract and free up some salary-cap space.

Some of that cash was used to sign Mitch Marner to a six-year, US$65-million agreement in September. As a part of Tuesday’s trade, Toronto will also get US$3.2-million back in salary-cap space in each of the next two years.

“We are excited about the first-round pick and we’re [happy with the others] as well,” Dubas said on an early-evening video call. “[Kasperi] is a good NHL player and we are happy for him. I don’t think he has reached his ceiling yet, and he has lots of room to grow and develop.

“This trade wasn’t about us being dissatisfied with him. This was just the deal we thought was the best fit for us.”

Kapanen came to Toronto in 2015 as part of the blockbuster trade that sent Phil Kessel to the Penguins.

“Kasperi is a good, young player that brings speed to our lineup and plays the way we want to play,” Jim Rutherford, the Penguins general manager, said in a statement. Rutherford drafted him in 2014. “We know him as a player and feel he can improve our top six.”

If that is the case, it would find him playing on a line with either Sidney Crosby or Evgeni Malkin.

“If they think I can play in one of those spots, it’s a huge honour,” Kapanen said. “I’m excited to be back in Pittsburgh and excited for the opportunity.”

Kapanen was a baby when he moved from Finland to Connecticut, where his father, Sami, played for the Hartford Whalers. Thanks to his dad’s NHL career, he grew up a hockey brat. As a kid, he also lived in North Carolina for six years, then in the New Jersey suburbs for five after Sami Kapanen was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers.

He had a career-high 20 goals and 44 points in 78 regular-season games in 2018-19, and recorded 97 points in 227 games, including the playoffs, with Toronto.

His numbers fell a bit in the COVID-19-abbreviated season, to 13 goals and 23 assists in 69 games. He admits being disappointed with his own performance and that of the Maple Leafs this season. They were eliminated from the Return to Play qualifying tournament in five games by the Columbus Blue Jackets.

“This year, right off the hop, it wasn’t the start I wanted,” Kapanen said. “I thought I would get it back in the playoffs, but I feel both me and our team could have done a lot better. It is kind of a bad way to end with [the Maple Leafs], but I am thankful for the opportunity they gave me for five years.”

Along with the draft pick, the Maple Leafs also acquired forwards Evan Rodrigues and Filip Hallander and defenceman David Warsofsky. Toronto sent journeyman forward Pontus Aberg and defensive prospect Jesper Lindgren to Pittsburgh along with Kapanen.

Story continues below advertisement

A 27-year-old centre from Toronto, Rodrigues played in 199 games over five seasons for Buffalo and Pittsburgh with 27 goals and 72 points. He was not on the Penguins roster this postseason, which ended in a surprising four-game defeat by the Montreal Canadians in the qualifying round.

Kapanen said that he returns to Pittsburgh as a more well-rounded player.

“When I was drafted, I was one-dimensional,” he said. “I loved to play with the puck and to score goals. Everything else was kind of lacking in me.”

He was one of the Maple Leafs’ fastest players and had moxie, which was in short supply among the team’s forwards. He had three fights this season, including one with Rodrigues when the latter still played for Buffalo.

“I feel like I am an energy player and do everything I can to help the team,” Kapanen said. “I’m not going to be the biggest point-maker or scorer. That’s not my job. It’s to be part of the team and do anything possible to help it win night in and night out.”

Dubas said that this is probably only the first of Toronto’s moves in the off-season.

Story continues below advertisement

“This was a good start toward getting where we want to go,” he said.

The Maple Leafs have been eliminated in the first round of the postseason in each of the past four years, and pressure is building.

“When we don’t reach our expectation or potential, the blame should directly come to me,” Dubas said. “I don’t take any of the criticism personally. I know it is deserved, it’s fair and I expect it.”"

It may not have been exactly how Thierry Henry envisioned his first game at Saputo Stadium as Impact coach, but he is savouring the three points just the same.

Playing their first game in exactly one month, the Montreal Impact (3-2-1) came away with a 2-0 victory over the Vancouver Whitecaps (2-6-0) on Tuesday night in front of 250 spectators.

The Impact became Canada’s first professional sports team to play in front of fans since the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted MLS play in March.

“It’s better than when there’s no one,” said Henry. “We heard them. They encouraged us. It was important to have them. They supported the players until the very end.

“There’s nothing better than having fans in the stadium.”

The crowd of 250 – the maximum permitted inside Saputo Stadium under Quebec’s public-health guidelines – were scattered across eight separate stands in the 20,801-seat venue.

Though pre-recorded fan noise from the stadium’s speakers sometimes drowned them out, the few fans made themselves heard when Montreal took an early lead.

Missed coverage by Vancouver on the left wing gave Saphir Taider yards of space in the 18th minute. The midfielder delivered a lovely out-swinging cross with the outside of his boot into the box to Romell Quioto, who headed it home.

A deep ball by Emanuel Maciel found the speedy Lassi Lappalainen behind the Whitecaps’ back line in the 40th. Lappalainen let the ball settle down before coolly firing into the far corner of the net, out of goalkeeper Thomas Hasal’s reach.

A fan rang the stadium bell after every goal.

“The cohesion was there, the chemistry for us was there,” said midfielder Samuel Piette. “There’s a lot of stuff we need to work on, but I like the fact that when we have the ball, we try to play. We didn’t just kick the ball forward and try to defend.

“We applied the game plan and they couldn’t really find anything. It was hard for them to find any gaps and dangerous attacking spots to hurt us.”

Other supporters without tickets gathered outside the grounds, chanting, drumming and setting off smoke bombs.

“It’s kind of cool to be one of the first to be part of a live event,” season-ticket holder Maxime Theriault said before kickoff. “It’s like a private session or a private practice.”

Fans had their temperatures checked at the gate and were required to wear face masks at all times while inside the stadium.

“I never envisioned there would be any semblance of a season,” said Impact supporter Dany Trudeau, who attended the game with his father. “We still don’t know what will happen with the American teams. Right now we’re taking any games they’ll give us.”

All players took a knee prior to kickoff in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Impact goalkeeper Clement Diop raised his fist in the air.

The Whitecaps struggled offensively in the first half despite seeing more of the ball.

Down 2-0, Vancouver had a chance to halve the deficit in the 50th minute when Derek Cornelius went down in the box after Zachary Brault-Guillard kicked his thigh.

Lucas Cavallini failed to get much power into his spot kick. Diop dived to his left for the easy save, on his way to his second clean sheet of the season.

Substitute Anthony Jackson-Hamel nearly added a third goal for Montreal but his header from six yards out skimmed the crossbar in the 87th minute.

The Whitecaps dropped their third straight game after being blanked twice by Toronto FC last week. They have failed to score a goal in their last 379 minutes of play.

“I’m sick of having the same conversations over and over when we’re just getting the same result every single time,” said Cornelius. “It’s frustrating.

“At the end of the day, we have to all take a serious look at ourselves in the mirror to see what we can all be better at so we can finally have something to show for. Because this is too much now.”

The three Canadian MLS teams are facing each other three times – for a combined nine games – while COVID-19 border restrictions complicate travel to and from the U.S.

The results count in the MLS standings. The best team after nine games will earn a spot in the Canadian Championship final against the winner of this season’s Canadian Premier League.

This is the first ATP tournament in more than five months because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and while Djokovic was treated by a trainer and played sluggishly in his opening match Monday, he took control from the outset against Sandgren and saved all four break points he faced.

Djokovic tested positive for the novel coronavirus in June after organizing a series of exhibition matches in Serbia and Croatia, where fans were allowed and masks and physical distancing were not mandated.

He has won five of the past seven Grand Slam tournaments, including at the Australian Open in February. His winning streak is the longest to open a season since he began 41-0 in 2011, which is the best start for a man since at least 1990.

Djokovic was asked about the idea of finishing this unusual and truncated year undefeated.

“Look, anything is possible. ... I don’t want to count that out, I mean, especially because of the fact that we don’t know how the post-U.S. tour season is going to look like – whether we are going to play, whether there is going to be another lockdown in Europe or not. We are hoping not,” he said. “Right now, it’s not something I’m thinking about. It’s not my goal, actually, to go unbeaten, but I wouldn’t complain if I do.”

Djokovic will face 34th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff in the quarter-finals. The other quarter-final in the top half of the draw will be defending champion Daniil Medvedev against No. 8 seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Lionel Messi’s connection to his employer, FC Barcelona, was born out of a charitable impulse.

At 10 years old, Messi developed a serious growth hormone deficiency. After moving to Spain from Argentina, Messi was offered a tryout for Barcelona’s academy. He was a reedy tween, only four-and-a-half feet tall, and perhaps never going to get any bigger. But Barcelona offered him an academy spot, as well as agreeing to pay his roughly thousand-dollar-a-month medical expenses.

It would turn out to be the greatest investment in the history of sport.

No modern athlete is more associated with a great club than Messi has been with Barcelona these past 20-odd years.

Long before he got to the senior team, he was already a legend. Once he arrived at 17 years old, he shot well past the hype. His tenure has coincided with the most successful run in the Catalan club’s history.

At the height of it – roughly 2005-15 – Barcelona was the greatest team in the world. Of any kind, playing any sport and of all time.

Now, just like that, it’s over.

On Tuesday, Messi informed Barcelona he wants to leave the club. In a nice, passive-aggressive touch, he delivered the message via fax.

Nothing gets the emotions running hot quite like a good sports divorce – Gretzky and the Oilers; LeBron and Cleveland (Parts 1 and 2); Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. This one will put all others in the shade.

You wanted relief from COVID? This is it. Not that it’s going to help in a public-health sense. But it’s all anyone in the world will be talking about for weeks.

Story continues below advertisement

Messi has been souring on Barcelona for most of 2020. This year, a long, slow decline became a malaise.

Good times or bad, Messi has always presented the same public face. His shyness and reticence are famous. Schoolboy teammates have claimed they thought he was mute.

So when Messi got on Instagram to rip his boss in February, the effect was seismic.

Lionel Messi has told Barcelona he wants to leave the soccer club immediately, a source confirmed on Tuesday. The announcement has put Europe's top clubs on alert for a potential transfer of the six-time world player of the year. Reuters

It started when Barcelona’s sporting director, Eric Abidal, said in an interview he’d fired the manager because the players had quit on him. Messi challenged Abidal to name which players, exactly, he was talking about. He then accused Abidal of “dirtying” the squad.

This isn’t standard operating procedure at any club. But at Barcelona, it’s the equivalent of lighting up a Molotov cocktail in the middle of a board meeting.

A couple of months later, Messi was back at it. A tempest had arisen over player wage cuts in the midst of the pandemic. Messi blamed the club’s board for inflaming the situation. Once again, he did it publicly.

Story continues below advertisement

When Barcelona lost the league, Messi got on TV and called his team “inconsistent” and “weak.”

A guy who’d never said boo to a goose was all of a sudden turning into Norma Rae.

The cause of all this bickering was the club’s quality. At 33, Messi remains an irresistible force. But the great ones arrayed around him, several of them his former academy colleagues, are no longer quite as great.

The club reached its nadir two weeks ago in an 8-2 Champions League shellacking by eventual champion, Bayern Munich.

As a matter of general principles, Barcelona does not lose by six goals. There is no acceptable reason for that to happen.

Within hours, another manager (and another one Messi didn’t like much) had been fired. Then Abidal walked the plank (six months too late to do any good). The new manager, Ronald Koeman, held emergency talks with his one-man band.

Story continues below advertisement

“Messi is Barcelona,” Koeman said afterward. “And Barcelona is Messi.”

One supposes the meeting didn’t go quite as well as he’d thought.

Submitting a formal request for transfer is an extraordinary measure in soccer. It almost always ends one way – with the player getting what he wants. And no player has ever had as much leverage as this one.

Usually, this would be fairly simple. Only a few clubs on Earth can afford Messi’s salary, which is reported to be in the neighbourhood of $100-million a year. Every one of them will want him, so it’s a matter of which one he prefers.

An early favourite might be Manchester City. It has the cash, is managed by the man who guided Messi through his golden period, and is far enough away from Spain to soften the blow there.

But this fracas is complicated (I would probably say massively improved) by the fact that Messi disputes Barcelona’s contractual hold on him.

Story continues below advertisement

He reportedly believes he can cancel his deal at will so long as he publicly states his intentions. Which he’s just done. He would then be free to move anywhere he likes without a transfer fee.

Conversely, Barcelona believes any club that wants Messi must still pay his $1.1-billion buy-out clause (yes, you read that number right).

I suppose it’s possible this family squabble can still be patched up. But it appears more likely that it’s headed toward complete estrangement. Messi will appear awfully silly if he goes back on what he’s just done, which may be why he did it.

There is something sad and inevitable about all this. Messi was one of the last connections to the 20th-century ideal of coming up and eventually going out with the same organization.

Some time in the nineties, sports became the best-paid slice of the gig economy. Greed got repackaged and moralized (“I’m just doing what’s best for my family”). Loyalty became a synonym for foolishness. Messi was a one-man bulwark against that shift.

One of his former teammates, Javier Mascherano, once summed him up this way: “Although he may not be human, it’s good that Messi still thinks he is.” That is the key to Messi’s global appeal – he seems surreal and completely down-to-earth at the same time. People everywhere connect to his remarkable averageness.

Well, he’s never seemed more human than he does right now. That usually means something bad is about to happen."

Their raw emotion evident, their frustration palpable, Fred VanVleet and Norman Powell found themselves once again addressing the media in the aftermath of another shooting of a Black man by police.

The two Toronto Raptors are among the many players who have been using their platform at the NBA’s postseason bubble to speak out against systemic racism and police brutality. But after watching the video of Jacob Blake being shot multiple times, apparently in the back, by police in Kenosha, Wis., VanVleet told reporters he was “in a different place today, emotionally speaking.”

The situation has caused the Raptors to discuss their options on protesting as the team gears up for Game 1 of an Eastern Conference semi-final against the Boston Celtics on Thursday.

Story continues below advertisement

“You know coming down here and making a choice to play was supposed to not be in vain, but it’s just starting to feel like everything we’re doing is going through the motions and nothing’s really changing,” VanVleet said Tuesday. “Here we are today with another unfortunate incident, so my thoughts today are with that man and his family and trying to wrap my mind around what they’re going through.”

The Raptors have been at the forefront of the NBA’s social-justice initiatives, arriving to the league’s Walt Disney World campus in buses emblazoned with the “Black Lives Matter” slogan and asking for justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black people who have been killed by police.

VanVleet said now it’s time for others to get involved.

“We’re the ones with the microphones in our face, we’re the ones who have to make a stand,” VanVleet said. “The responsibility falls on us to make a change to stop being oppressed. At what point do we not have to speak about it any more?

“Are we going to hold everybody accountable, or are we just going to put the spotlight on Black people or Black athletes or entertainers and say ‘What are you doing? What are you contributing to your community? What are you putting on the line?‘”

VanVleet and Powell said players have discussed options on how to respond to Blake’s shooting. Powell said boycotting games has been discussed.

“There’s a lot of things that have been talked about on how to approach this sensitive issue,” Powell said. “I think everybody’s at the point of sitting up and saying ‘Black Lives Matter’ and having these discussions and Zoom calls and putting apparel on, that’s not getting the job done. Taking a knee for the anthem, that’s not getting the job done.

Story continues below advertisement

“It’s starting to get washed out. I feel like Black Lives Matter is just another thing in conversation now.

“Something needs to happen where you’re forcing those people who can affect and make the change to do something,” he added.

VanVleet said not playing could motivate the right people.

“We knew coming here or not coming here wasn’t going to stop anything, but I think ultimately playing or not playing puts pressure on somebody,” he said. “For example, this happened in Kenosha, wouldn’t it be nice, in a perfect world, if we all said we’re not playing, and the owner of the Milwaukee Bucks steps up to the plate and puts pressure on the district attorney’s office and state attorneys and governors and politicians there to make real change and get some justice.

“I know it’s not that simple, but if we’re going to sit here and talk about making change, then at some point we’re going to have to put our nuts on the line and actually put something up to lose rather than just money or visibility.”

The Wisconsin Department of Justice is leading an investigation into the shooting, which is expected to take several weeks. The officers were placed on administrative leave, which is standard practice in such cases.

Powell said police officers need to face consequences when under investigation.

“They believe they’re following the law and they think that’s okay,” Powell said. “‘We did an investigation and we found them not guilty.’ And they go home and sleep at night perfectly fine. They live their lives and go to their jobs.

“Until they’re on the line for getting fired and having to lose everything, nothing’s going to happen.”

VanVleet said his family have arrived in Orlando, and he will be able to see them in about a week. He said he thinks of his two young children when he sees an incident like the Blake shooting.

“We all personalize everything, so to personalize a situation like that and to think about my babies having to see that, or my son is going to have to walk some of these same environments and you have to teach your kids about how to interact with the police, and what to do, what not to do, you become helpless a little bit and it’s scary.”

Tuesday’s comments from Powell and VanVleet come with the Raptors getting ready to start a second-round series with the Celtics.

“I don’t really care about that right now to be honest with you,” VanVleet said. “I’m sure when Thursday comes and it’s time to play I’ll be able to lock into basketball, it’s not really that hard for me. I know that’s [the Celtics] an unbelievably talented team, a great team, and I think the fans have been looking forward to this for a long time.

“Once we get to that point, if we get to that point then we’ll deal with that when it comes, but right now today, on Tuesday, I couldn’t care less.”"

The Detroit Lions decided not to practice on Tuesday, protesting after a Black man was shot by police in Wisconsin.

“We came up with this one as a unit,” Detroit defensive end Trey Flowers said.

Lions coach Matt Patricia opened the team’s morning meeting by allowing players to share their thoughts on the shooting of Jacob Blake, who is paralyzed from the waist down. Blake was shot Sunday, three months after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.

The players continued to discuss Blake’s shooting and shared their personal experiences regarding race in the locker room.

Lions players and Patricia later filed out of the team’s practice facility, pushing a dry-erase board on wheels along the sidewalk to address the media. The words: “The world can’t go on,” was written in blue on one side of the dry-erase board and “We won’t be silent!! One pride,” was in black on the other side of the white board.

“If you’re being silent, you’re okay with it,” Detroit safety Duron Harmon said. “You’re okay with what’s happening. No one in this organization or on this team is okay with it. ""

Patricia said he is proud of the players and hopes they inspire other people and teams in the NFL to take a stand for social justice.

“I challenge everybody to do this, everybody in the league to do this,” Patricia said.

Seattle Seahawks defensive back Quandre Diggs showed his support on social media.

Colin Kaepernick, exiled from the NFL since the 2016 season when he took a knee during the national anthem, shed light on police brutality and racial inequality while playing for the San Francisco 49ers.

After the nationwide protests in the aftermath of Floyd’s death, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell apologized to players for not listening to them earlier, encouraged them to protest peacefully and denounced racism.

Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford said social justice issues were discussed as a team in Zoom meetings during the spring, when players were prevented from gathering at the team’s facility owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We’re dealing with times right now where something is shaking in the world,” Flowers added. “It’s definitely an unprecedented time with the pandemic and something that has been going on for quite some time with the social injustice.”

The conversations about race continued when the team reported for training camp earlier this month, and in face-to-face discussions Tuesday morning a player shared that his mother calls him nightly to make sure he arrived home safely.

“It’s an incredible group of guys that we have in this locker room led by a coach who is unwavering in his ability to give us space to talk,” Stafford said. “We spent all morning talking about it. You have to give a lot of credit to coach for allowing us to do that. I’ve never been more proud.

The Major League Soccer team is unveiling TFC Widenet, an app that evaluates young athletes six and up based on their speed and skills. In its present form, the free app will help TFC find kids who are fit and fast – and measure them against their own academy products.

“It’s a pathway to become – potentially – a TFC player,” said Humza Teherany, chief technology and digital officer at Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment.

The official launch is Tuesday, with the app available on iOS or Android.

“It literally casts a wide net,” said Jim Liston, Toronto FC’s director of sport science.

“Just looking at the results, you’re going to be able to see folks that are maybe at our academy level, maybe above. And perhaps they’ve fallen under the radar,” he added.

In its current form, the app combines augmented realty (AR) technology with the phone’s camera to measure an individual’s athletic ability while they run a 20-metre sprint and a 200-metre shuttle.

The user sets the course, which is verified by the app. The participant then hands their phone to a friend or sets it up on a stand to film the drills – either a simple 20-metre sprint or back and forth five times for the 200-metre shuttle.

The app verifies the data which then goes back to TFC. The information also is entered in a leaderboard, allowing participants to see how they fare against others their age and gender.

The app, which will be expanded to offer more measuring tools, comes out of MLSE’s desire to harness technology for the good of its teams.

“How do we find talent? How do we do it differently than everybody else? How do we get access to every kid in the country, maybe even every kid in the world, leveraging our digital capabilities,” said Teherany. “And then we went to work on the tech.”

That came in-house from MLSE Digital Labs, whose staff numbers more than 100. Teherany calls it “the largest and deepest technology organization in pro sports.”

While the app is simple to use, a lot of time and work went under the hood to make it so.

“We had an idea from a team standpoint,” said Liston. “Humza and his group came in from the technology side and they said “Sure, we can do it.'

“The drive is to get any kind of competitive advantage we can, at any time.”

Liston recalls a testing session in Hamilton several years ago. There were five tests, which was going to require eight coaches and two hours.

“Then the idea became how ‘OK, can we do this simply and how can we do it anywhere?”’ said Liston.

They chose the 20-metre sprint and 200-metre shuttle, because they can be done in park or gym.

MLSE has been working on the digital talent search for a while but the idea was accelerated by the pandemic. Suddenly testing talent remotely was more than a mere luxury.

“It’s frankly a very new world,” said Teherany. “And the fact is if you’re not all-in with digital, you’re going to be playing catch-up.”

While Toronto and other MLSE teams already “scout across the planet,” Teherany says that search can be assisted digitally – especially in a world struggling with COVID-19.

“I don’t know how you scout a year from now without having technology tools like this. I think it becomes harder. I think those that have these skills and technologies and can actually build it into the way they scout ... I think it’s going to be must-do’s.”

Teherany says there’s more to come.

“We are now looking at all things technology, innovation and digital across MLSE from a business perspective. And more and more as part of our MLSE Digital Sports Performance Labs, we’re partnering with our (teams') front offices to understand where we can double-down on digital and innovation to continue to gain a competitive advantage in the quest for more championships for the city.

“If we can do anything obviously to drive an edge using analytics data, sensors, access to real-time information, then that’s what we’re there to do. I think this first internal innovation here with TFC is one of many to come. We’ve got a lot more in the works.”"

JASON FRANSON/The Canadian Press

Calgary Flames general manager Brad Treliving says he is impressed with how his team came together this season through some unprecedented times – from a very public coaching change to a playoff run isolated from friends and family.

He also believes another first-round playoff exit is unacceptable for a team that has much higher aspirations.

Whether the Flames are a team close to breaking out, or one in need of a major overhaul, will be the big question the team’s management will wrestle with this off-season.

Story continues below advertisement

“Do I think there’s some growth in the group? Yes,” Treliving said Monday, four days after the Flames were bounced from the NHL postseason by the Dallas Stars. “But we’re also in the business of winning. And I don’t want there to be confusion that we think there was growth but we think there’s another level that we should achieve, and could have achieved. I feel strongly that we should still be playing.”

The Flames have been past the first round of the playoffs just once in the past 11 seasons, and their past two eliminations have been particularly frustrating. Calgary finished first in the Western Conference in 2018-19 before making a meek first-round exit in a five-game loss to Colorado.

With much of the core of that team intact, the Flames beat an undermanned Winnipeg Jets team in four games in a playoff qualifying series, and then took a 2-1 lead in their first-round series with the Stars.

Then the Flames flamed out. On the verge of going up 3-1, Calgary allowed the Stars to tie Game 4 in the final minute of regulation before Alexander Radulov’s overtime goal game the Stars a 5-4 win.

Dallas squeaked by Calgary 2-1 in Game 5, but the Flames looked poised to take Game 6 when they raced out to a quick 3-0 lead. They wouldn’t score again, as the Stars poured in seven unanswered goals to move on to the second round.

Flames interim head coach Geoff Ward took some heat when he pulled goaltender Cam Talbot with the game tied 3-3. Backup David Rittich surrendered three goals on nine shots before Talbot returned to the game.

“We’re disappointed with the way it ended,” Flames defenceman Mark Giordano said. “The Dallas series is still fresh in our minds. We felt like there’s those critical moments and different opportunities to grab hold of that one, and the game that sticks out is the overtime game.

Story continues below advertisement

“Obviously them being able to get a late one, and then score to tie the series, whereas we would have been up 3-1, that’s the one that’s fresh in our mind. But our guys, we’re a tight group. We came a lot closer together as the year went on and through this whole process, and there’s a lot of things to be proud of too.”

A step in the right direction might not be enough for Giordano, who succeeded Hall of Famer Jarome Iginla as captain before the 2013-14 season. With every season, his window to lead the Flames to a Stanley Cup closes a little more.

“As every year goes by it gets tougher and tougher,” Giordano said. “We came into the bubble and I thought right off the bat we were playing with a ton of grit, something that we lacked in years past. I thought that carried over into the Dallas series but again they’re a great team, a veteran team, and at critical moments they made sure they were able to grab momentum from us.

“It’s disappointing, again. You go into every playoffs with a lot of excitement and hope and it really felt like we accomplished a lot of good things throughout those series, but at the end of the day we still lost in the first round, and every year that that happens is a lost opportunity.”

Still, Treliving said he thought his team adapted well to life in the NHL’s western playoff bubble in Edmonton, made necessary because of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, and said there will be no knee-jerk decisions when addressing the future of his team.

“I think when you don’t achieve what you hope, and when I say that I think I’m speaking for our fanbase, everybody sometimes wants a body on the tarmac,” Treliving said. “Those are all things we’re going to evaluate. We’re going to evaluate how we take that next step that we need to take.

Story continues below advertisement

“There’s always speculation when you end your season prematurely. I’m just going to step back and analyze it with our organization and we’ll address the things that we need to address. But you’re not going to make change just to make change. I’ve never felt that, never believed it.”

One member of the Flames who faces an uncertain future is Ward, who looked all but certain at one point in time to have the interim tag removed from his job title.

Ward was abruptly promoted from associate coach in November after Bill Peters resigned amid allegations of misconduct, including directing racial slurs at former NHL player Akim Aliu when Peters was an AHL coach. A .500 team then, the Flames rallied from the controversy to go 24-15-3 with Ward.

Ward said Monday he would like to be back, but would let his body of work speak for him. While Treliving said Ward did a good job under exceptional circumstances, he didn’t give the coach a firm endorsement Monday.

“When you go through all the emotional stuff you go through at the end of a season, I think it’s important to look at it through a clear, unemotional lens,” Treliving said of assembling his coaching staff for next season. “We’ll act at the appropriate time, and we’ll give it the appropriate time to review.”"

After the Canucks’ meltdown on Sunday, the question that looms is whether it was a one-off playoff stinker or a troubling sign of what’s to come?

After eliminating the defending Stanley Cup champions two nights earlier, Vancouver was throttled by the Vegas Golden Knights 5-0 in the first game of their Western Conference semi-final series.

The Canucks failed in pretty much every facet, other than at faceoffs. They fumbled pucks. They got bottled up and trapped in their own end. They lost their composure against an opponent they have yet to beat in regulation time in three seasons. With Sunday’s defeat, they are now 0-9-2 against Vegas.

The evening began with Antoine Roussel, the agitator who plays on Vancouver’s left wing, chirping at Golden Knights goalie Robin Lehner during pregame warm-ups. The latter went on to pitch a shutout.

“I want to thank him,” Lehner said afterward. “He got a performance out of me that was a couple percentage points more [than usual]. I hope he keeps going. He is just poking the bear.”

That wasn’t the worst of Roussel’s night of misadventure. At one point, he ducked a fight with Vegas forward Ryan Reaves, who then clucked at him like a chicken. Later, Roussel was assessed a 10-minute misconduct penalty after he poked Reaves with his stick, and then hugged and whispered something not so sweet in his ear.

Golden Knights players tapped their sticks and jeered Roussel when he exited the penalty box.

“I don’t think he is distracting anyone but himself,” Vegas winger Reilly Smith said. “If that’s the way he wants to play the whole series, he’ll just hurt his own team.”

Vancouver was outshot, 39-26, and outhit, 54-45, with Reaves delivering a game-high 11.

After Vegas took a 4-0 lead with its third goal of the second period, Canucks winger Tanner Pearson trashed his stick on the bench.

Story continues below advertisement

It was that kind of a night all around. Two of the Canucks’ young stars, Elias Pettersson and Brock Boeser, never got a shot on goal. Between them, Bo Horvat and J.T. Miller had three. Netminder Jacob Markstrom was pulled in the third period after allowing his fifth goal on 34 shots.

“I don’t think it was the kind of game any of us wanted to play,” Chris Tanev, the Vancouver defenceman, said Monday during a video call with journalists.

Vancouver head coach Travis Green called it his team’s worst game of the post-season. The Canucks eliminated Minnesota in four games in the return-to-play qualifying tournament, and then dispatched the St. Louis Blues in six games in the Stanley Cup’s first round.

“Each series presents a new challenge,” Green said on Monday. “First and foremost, we have to play better and I am confident we will. There were just a lot of little things we didn’t do well. We weren’t sharp.

“It’s part of playoff hockey. I’m sure our team is pissed off and should be. You learn there are ups and down and there’s adversity. Any time we have asked our team to respond, they’ve done it.”

The Golden Knights, the top seed in the Western Conference, finished the abbreviated regular season by winning 11 of their last 13 games before the NHL suspended play on March 12 because of the outbreak of COVID-19.

Story continues below advertisement

They then won all three games in the round robin before dispatching with the Chicago Blackhawks in five games in the first round. That means Vegas has won 19 of its past 22.

Lehner is 9-1 since being acquired at the trade deadline in a three-team deal including the Maple Leafs and Blackhawks, and appears to have displaced Marc-André Fleury as the starter.

He made 26 saves on Sunday night in a game where Vancouver had very few good chances.

Almost every year, playoff series lurch back and forth with teams trading the momentum. Often, there hardly is any from one game to the next.

That is what the Canucks are banking on after getting spanked in the opener. They play again Tuesday night at Rogers Place in Edmonton, the hub site for Western teams.

As dominant as it was, Vegas is going forward with caution.

“Every year every team changes a little bit,” the Golden Knights’ Jonathan Marchessault said. “I think they are a much better team. We have to respect them. [Sunday night] we were just a little bit better. It’s just one game.”"

Patient and positive, Brett Brown was the perfect coach for the Philadelphia 76ers when they set up a long-term home in the NBA basement.

They’ll be looking for someone else now that they want to be on top.

The 76ers fired coach Brown on Monday, a day after his seventh season ended in a first-round post-season sweep.

Story continues below advertisement

The 76ers were 43-30 this season and had woefully underachieved in a year when they were expected to be serious contenders in the Eastern Conference.

After the sixth-seeded Sixers were swept by the Boston Celtics, the move was expected.

“I have a tremendous level of respect for Brett both personally and professionally and appreciate all he’s done for the 76ers organization and the city of Philadelphia,” general manager Elton Brand said in a statement. “He did many positive things during his time here, developing young talent and helping position our team for three straight post-season appearances. Unfortunately, we fell well short of our goals this year and I believe it is best to go in a new direction.”

Brown finished 221-344, though his record was never going to be pretty because the Sixers weren’t trying to win when he was hired.

Brown was tasked with the leading the Sixers through a rebuild dubbed “The Process,” where management stripped the roster of serious NBA talent to lose games and increase their odds at better draft picks. Brown won only 47 games in his first three seasons, including a 10-72 record in 2015-16.

The philosophy paid off when Philly drafted Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, who would both become All-Stars and lead the Sixers to two straight trips to the Eastern Conference semifinals.

But Simmons missed the post-season with a knee injury and neither Embiid nor the players brought in in recent years could provide enough scoring in clutch situations against Boston.

Story continues below advertisement

The 76ers said they would begin a search for a new coach immediately to replace Brown, who quickly earned respect around the league for keeping a positive outlook even during a no-win situation.

“In 2013, I was employed to lead one of the most dramatic rebuilds in professional sports history. In the past seven years, our players and coaches have evolved and grown, and I have deep appreciation for the 102 players I have coached,” Brown said.

The Sixers believed they were ready to contend for their first championship in 37 years and Brand spent $180 million to re-sign Tobias Harris and nearly $100 million to sign free agent Al Horford away from Boston.

Instead, the Sixers had only snippets of consistent success and Brown paid the price. The longtime San Antonio Spurs assistant is now out of a job on a contract that runs through the 2021-2022 season.

Even with two 26-game losing streaks on Brown’s resume, the front office never wavered early in his tenure that Brown was the right coach to bring Philadelphia its first championship since 1983. He steered the franchise as interim general manager in 2018 after Bryan Colangelo was fired amid a Twitter scandal.

But the Sixers’ support started to wean at the end of the last season, as team owner Josh Harris for the first time put public pressure on Brown to at least reach the East final. And at an impromptu news conference before the start of the playoffs, Harris refused to say if Brown would return and offered only a lukewarm endorsement of his performance.

Another lukewarm endorsement of Brown came Sunday from guard Josh Richardson after the Sixers’ elimination.

“He’s a good guy, he’s a good man, he means well. I just think going forward he’s got to ask more accountability,” Richardson said. “I don’t think there was much accountability this season and I think that was part of our problem.”

There were also big basketball problems.

Simmons still hasn’t developed a reliable jump shot, Embiid can’t stay consistently healthy, and Brand’s off-season moves largely backfired. That left the Sixers with a mismatched roster and Brown was unable to make the pieces work.

Brown was part of three NBA title teams with San Antonio as an assistant and won another with the Spurs when he served in the basketball operations department in 1998-99. He left after that season to become the head coach of the Sydney Kings of the Australian National Basketball League, but rejoined the Spurs in 2002 as the team’s assistant coach/director of player development and was moved to the bench as an assistant under Gregg Popovich in 2006.

Brown often was deemed the de facto spokesman for the Sixers and had to explain numerous injuries and baffling transactions or speak about Twitter scandals while ownership and the front office were nowhere to be found.

He signed a four-year deal for his NBA first head coaching job in 2013 with the understanding the Sixers were trying to rebuild. But he would later admit he had no idea the 76ers would struggle so badly four years into a tenure filled with coaching developmental league castoffs and 10-day contract players for a shot at building a winner through lottery draft picks.

“To coach gypsies or to have to coach a revolving door is not what I am looking for,” he said in 2015.

Now, it’s Brown’s turn to hit the road."

Kim Klement/The Associated Press

The Toronto Raptors have thrived all season despite a revolving door of injured players, and their depth shone once again in Sunday night’s record-breaking rout of Brooklyn.

But the Raptors want Kyle Lowry on the floor when they face the Boston Celtics on Thursday.

“It would hurt us a lot,” coach Nick Nurse said of the possibility of playing without Lowry. “You guys know how big a cog he is to this whole thing. He’s our most experienced, toughest leader we got.”

Story continues below advertisement

Lowry was diagnosed with a left ankle sprain Monday after undergoing an MRI. The six-time all-star suffered the injury when he stepped on the foot of Chris Chiozza late in the first quarter of Sunday’s 150-122 series-clinching victory over the Nets.

The Raptors said they would update Lowry’s status when appropriate; for now, he’s a question mark ahead of Toronto’s second-round series against Boston that tips off on Thursday.

A sprain sounds more positive than Nurse’s suggestion Sunday night that Lowry injured the arch of his foot. But depending on the severity, sprains can take anywhere from days to weeks to heal.

Boston is missing Gordon Hayward who suffered a right ankle sprain in Game 1 against Philadelphia. Hayward left the bubble to continue his rehab and is expected to be out for at least the entire second round.

Dallas superstar Luka Doncic, on the other hand, sprained his ankle in Game 3 against the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday, but bounced back with a spectacular game Sunday, recording 43 points, 17 rebounds and 13 assists. Doncic hit the long step-back jumper at the buzzer to lead the Mavericks to a 135-133 overtime win.

Lowry sprained an ankle in the 2017 playoffs and sat out Games 3 and 4 of a four-game sweep by Cleveland in the conference semi-finals.

The 34-year-old played through a serious hand injury, however, in last year’s historic championship run. Lowry damaged ligaments in his left thumb in the conference semis but didn’t miss a game. He was forced to wear a compression glove resembling a huge oven mitt while not playing and underwent surgery soon after the season ended.

Story continues below advertisement

“I would imagine this: It’s going to be a helluva injury to keep him off the floor,” Nurse said. “It’s not going to be a little thing, he’s going to try to figure it out.”

While the Celtics are expected to be a considerably tougher opponent than Brooklyn, particularly if Lowry’s not in the lineup, the Raptors have dealt with adversity all season.

The Raptors lost NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard in the off-season. Their 219 man games lost to injury, before the restart in Florida, was fifth worst in the league. Each of their top five scorers missed at least 10 games. Lowry missed 14, and the team went 12-2 in his absence.

Their motto has been: next man up. And the bench stepped up in record fashion Sunday, scoring 100 points, the most in any game since those stats began being tracked in the 1970-71. Toronto’s 150 points was a franchise record.

Norman Powell, who led the way with 29 points, said playing without Lowry would be “tough.”

“He’s our leader. He’s our focal point when we are out there, on and off the court,” Powell said. “Hopefully, with these days off, he’s able to recover and get back out there and play because we are going to need him. But it’s like we always say: It’s going to be next man up with everyone pulling for one another.”

While the Raptors (53-19) and Celtics (48-24), who were ousted by Milwaukee in five games in last year’s conference semi-finals, know each other well, they’ve never met in the postseason.

“It is a little surprising we’ve never bumped into each other this whole run,” Nurse said. “They’re super-talented, they’re deep, they’re very well coached, they’re playing great at the moment. They put away a very talented Philly team with ease [in a four-game sweep].”

Toronto’s one loss since the restart was a 122-100 rout by Boston on Aug. 7.

“We know [the Celtics] are a great team,” Raptors big man Serge Ibaka said. “They don’t get a lot of talk but they are a great team … they play hard, and they play as a team. They have a good bench, so we need to come in and play basketball, man.”

Boston won three of four meetings against the Raptors in the regular season, including a victory in Toronto on Christmas. The Raptors avenged that loss in Boston three days later.

“I think it’s going to be fun,” Powell said about facing Boston. “It’s always back and forth. They beat us and then we come back at them. We are evenly matched teams. It’s going to be about the guys who can play harder, who can limit their mistakes and then go out there and execute. I’m kind of bummed that we are not going to have the fans down there at TD Garden or what our fans bring at Scotiabank [Arena] … that is an added element that is going to be missed.”

Lowry averaged 19.4 points, a team-high 7.5 assists and five rebounds through 58 games with Toronto this season. Through the first round of the playoffs, he posted averages of 12.5 points, 4.8 assists and 7.0 rebounds and scored in double figures three times, including 21 points in Game 2 of the opening-round series.

I have a 1976 BMW 2002 with a mildly modified engine. First, what motor oil do you recommend? The manufacturer recommends 20w50 which can be difficult to find, and of course, motor oil has changed a lot in the last 40 years.

Second, I have been diligent about using Shell 91 octane gas, since it is the only one I am aware of that is ethanol-free. Can you give your opinion as to whether ethanol blends are harmful to this particular car, and, if so, what steps I can take to mitigate the moisture problems it entails?

I really appreciate your no-nonsense advice with respect to maintenance and read your column faithfully.

Tom B, Ottawa

Thanks, and very cool car Tom.

Vehicles that predate catalytic converters used motor oil with higher levels of zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP). After catalytic converters were introduced, it was found that the zinc was damaging the convertors, and thus, zinc levels were reduced in modern oils. Your grade of oil is limited in comparison to newer vehicle grade lubricants but shouldn’t actually be that difficult to source as there are several oil companies that offer 20w50 vintage oil-specific products. While you may have to call around a bit, I’m sure some Ottawa automotive-parts jobber has something that will work, either in stock or that they can order in quickly enough. I personally use Lucas Hot Rod and Classic Car 20w50 motor oil in my 1966 Porsche 912. Not because I’ve spent hours researching oils for my car, but because my parts supplier keeps it in stock, and like a pizza, I can pick up the phone and have a couple of litres delivered in 30 minutes.

Yes, stick with ethanol-free fuels such as the Shell V-power 91, but also, I believe, Canadian Tire 91, Esso 91 and Coscto 91 are ethanol-free. I’m sure your BMW sits a lot, so make sure it is always kept full of ethanol-free fuel to minimize condensation. Also, upgrade rubber hoses and cork gaskets whenever possible, as I’m sure years of moisture-laden fuel have brought them to the end of their life.

Hi Lou,

On recent travels in New Zealand, England and the U.S., I have found that the NZ and the U.K. service stations are selling regular that is 91 octane and premium is 93, while in the U.S., premium is 93, 91 is mid-grade and 87 is regular. Canada, meanwhile, offers regular at 87 octane, and super is 91. I have an MGC that will only run without knocking on hills with 93 octane, which I cannot always find. What is going on with the marketing of gasoline in Canada?

Story continues below advertisement

Thank you,

Malcolm B

I am definitely not an expert in worldwide fuel octane ratings, but here is my non-engineer explanation. Europe displays the Research Octane Number (RON) only, while Canada and the USA display the Anti-Knock Index (AKI). AKI is calculated by averaging out the result from the RON labs test and also the Motor Octane Number (MON) test; thus, the formula is (R+M)/2=AKI. The MON rating is the more stringent test of the two and therefore produces a lower octane number. For example, a RON of 95 and MON of 87 would average out to an AKI of 91.

Your problem lies in finding 93 Octane fuel, and unfortunately, the primary factors determining availability are regional needs. Most Canadian fuels vary between 87-91 with specialty higher-elevation markets like the Rockies selling 91 to 93. Every retailer needs to turn their inventory, and fuel vendors are no different. It’s a simple matter of supply and demand. Southern U.S. states sell 93 because their warmer climates result in engines running a bit hotter, requiring higher-octane fuel.

What’s on my radar

Knowing of my enthusiasm for older, vintage Porsches, a friend dropped by to show off a 2020 Porsche 911 Carrera S that he was driving for the week. Given my unique perspective as an auto technician, pseudo-journalist and vintage air-cooled Porsche 912 owner, I thought I would take it upon myself to give an old-versus-new comparison.

Firstly, for those who aren’t aware of 912 history, it was available from 1965 to 1969 and then had a brief reprise as the 912E in ’75 and ’76. Porsche used the 911 body, chassis and most mechanicals for the 912, with one significant exception – they opted to reuse the four-cylinder engine from the outgoing Porsche 356 instead of their new 2.0-litre six-cylinder. In essence, it was a 911 lite, and this cheaper variant went on to outsell the original 911 two-to-one.

Looking at the new 911 and my old 912 side by side, it’s apparent that Porsche has not strayed far from the styling cues that has worked so well for them since 1963. The roofline, glass and pillars of the 2020 car take after the 912 in the way a grandchild resembles their grandparent. As I drove the new 911 for the first time, I was also keenly aware that despite how much had changed, so much of it still felt surprisingly similar. Driving position and visibility were almost identical, with every switch and control exactly where I expected it to be. Even the rear seats still look as utterly useless as they always did.

My 912 features four-wheel disc brakes, which was unheard of in 1966. They are absolutely fantastic for the time period and decent even by today’s standards. The 2020′s massive brake rotors are obviously superior, but what really startled me was the difference in power output. My ’66 generates a usable yet paltry 89 horsepower and 90 lbs.-ft. of torque from its 1.6-litre engine. Compare that to the 3.0-litre turbocharged motor that’s producing 443 hp and 390 lbs.-ft. of torque in the modern 911. Just one stab at full throttle put the biggest grin on my face.

Whether you are a Porsche enthusiast or not, one has to give the company due credit for being able to keep the 911 relevant and exciting after all these years, even with their missteps along the way.

The BMW M8 Cabriolet is not a subtle car, and especially not when it’s painted in the “Individual” colour option of Verde Mantis. Individual, indeed. This is a love-it-or-hate-it colour with no middle ground, much like the M8 itself.

“That’s a gorgeous car – I love the colour,” the guy on the sidewalk called over when I stopped my bright-green ride at a red light.

“Hideous,” said my friend Melanie when she saw the photo I’d posted on Facebook.

Story continues below advertisement

“I love your car – I’m admiring that green,” said the stylish woman in a Toyota, driving slowly past in the parking lot.

But the best of them all: “I wouldn’t put my coffin in that car!” said my mother-in-law when she saw it parked outside her seniors’ residence. I told her it would only fit if the roof was down, and it could be arranged, propped up on the front passenger seat, but she’s still lamenting her much-beloved Honda Civic, a far more practical vehicle.

Open this photo in gallery The Verde Mantis colour is among several 'Individual' options available. Mark Richardson/The Globe and Mail

Her Civic was a far less expensive vehicle too, of course. The M8 is one of the priciest BMWs in the German maker’s lineup, and this tester was the “Competition” version. You can buy a basic M8 coupe for $151,000 before taxes and the convertible edition for almost $10,000 more than that, but the Competition lists for $173,500. For the extra money, you get a bump in power from 600 horsepower to 617, as well as a louder Sport exhaust that’s activated with the touch of a console button. That went down well at the seniors’ residence, I can tell you.

There are other advantages to the Competition version. The wheels are different, it has a firmer setting for the suspension, and it has a flashier Track mode on the instrument display. Most important, it has badges that tell everyone you’re driving the Competition edition. BMW says it’s a tenth of a second faster getting from zero to 100 km/h than the regular M8, but when that’s flashing past in 3.3 seconds, I doubt you’ll notice. I certainly didn’t.

Open this photo in gallery Exterior badges ensure passersby know you're driving the Competition edition. Mark Richardson/The Globe and Mail

The twin-turbo 4.4-litre V8 engine is a wonder of engineering, as you would expect. The really impressive thing is that this beast of a car is easy to drive sedately on humdrum errands, but if you press one of the red buttons on the steering wheel, it can turn instantly into a snarling, sparring, automotive monster.

BMW has always offered greater adjustability of the car’s controls than most makers. Heated seats, for example, can be set to a specific temperature and to the region of the seat. BMW will say this is because its owners are more exacting than most, while I would say its owners are just fussier, and that’s being charitable. Still, if you’re the fussy sort, you can set up pretty much everything about the M8 just as you think you like’ll it.

Open this photo in gallery Red buttons on the steering wheel let the driver switch between custom drive modes. Mark Richardson/The Globe and Mail

This means you can adjust the response of the engine, chassis, steering and brakes, and even set the all-wheel drive to rear-only, allowing you to slide around at the edge of adhesion on a racetrack. Those red steering-wheel buttons activate your own presets on the drive, so you can roar up to my mother-in-law in your own customized Sport Plus, then swoop her off to her doctor’s appointment in customized Comfort. She’ll be hunched down so as not to be recognized, of course. If she slides her seat forward, there’s even a reasonable amount of leg space for an adult in the two seats behind.

In fairness to BMW, the car itself is terrific to drive and responsive despite its size, though the Competition version is a waste of money if you don’t intend to drive it on the track. I’m surprised BMW doesn’t just offer the Competition as the only version, since bragging rights are important for a car like this. At these six-figure prices, an extra 5 per cent or so is not generally a big deal, and chances are you’ll want the ventilated seats, better sound system and carbon engine cover that all add to the price. With these and some other options, my tester’s price was pushed to $189,200 before taxes and the mysterious $2,480 Destination charge.

Open this photo in gallery The drop-top version costs about $10,000 more than the base M8, and the Competition edition is even pricier. Mark Richardson/The Globe and Mail

For that extra money, you also get additional choices of “Individual” paint colours, including Verde Mantis. You can order literally any colour you want for your new BMW, at a price, but when you pay the extra $14,500 for the “Individual Manufaktur Package,” that includes more than 90 new paint colours on top of the 15 colours in the regular range. Verde Mantis is based on a Lamborghini shade of green and was originally requested in 2017 by a customer for his BMW M4 Competition.

It was clearly quite a hit, though it’s unlikely you’ll see many other BMWs, or even Lamborghinis, painted in the same shade. For that, my mother-in-law is grateful, but don’t listen to her. I never do. Listen to the other 50 per cent of the population who love it. And if you ever doubt their judgment, listen to the engine instead. Just make sure you set it to Sport first.

California blinked. Last week, corporate colossuses Uber and Lyft threatened to cease operating their ride-hailing services in response to the state’s demand that they treat their drivers as full-time employees rather than independent contractors. California’s Assembly Bill 5, which stipulates that so-called “gig-workers” must be protected and given benefits such as a minimum wage and unemployment insurance, went into effect in January 2020. Uber and Lyft oppose the bill, maintaining that it is impossible to change their business model “overnight.”

Uber and Lyft said that if a stay were not issued by the California appeals court, they would take their apps and go home at the stroke of midnight on August 21, leaving approximately, 350,000 Lyft drivers and 100,000 Uber drivers out of work. The companies hope to reverse the ruling on November 3 when Californians get to vote for Proposition 22, an initiative that would cancel most of the mandated changes to their work force. They’re spending big money – so far a reported US$110 million – to make sure it does.

Uber and Lyft got their last-minute stay. It’s far from a victory, however, and the war over the future of ride-sharing mobility is bound to rage on into the U.S. federal election. The day after the stay was issued, the Washington Post reported Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh blaming Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden for threatening, “Lyft and Uber drivers’ livelihoods” in order to “take away workers’ opportunity to make their own schedules and participate in a free and open gig economy.”

Story continues below advertisement

That Trump’s twisted trolls see advantage in this fight illustrates what a bewildering fable the ride-hailing saga has become. It is the story of what happens when Silicon Valley enterprises hell-bent on profits meet a tired, technologically backward industry hell-bent on coasting. That was the scenario when the technology was introduced.

It’s important to remember that when Uber and Lyft arrived in 2013, they were not assailing a modern, efficient industry. Taxi service was archaic. In most Canadian cities, for example, taxis were a virtual monopoly. This bred poor treatment. While there were good drivers who knew their cities, kept their cars clean and treated customers with courtesy, there were others who arbitrarily refused a fare because they didn’t consider the route worth their time. It was normal for drivers to refuse to accept credit cards or administer a mysterious “service charge” for using credit. The technology in place in traditional taxis was non-existent.

Uber arrived and offered users the chance for a seamless ride. Uber uses GPS to find the nearest vehicles and gives customers the price prior to the trip. It is a cashless transaction. Tip, any tolls and government sales taxes are all included. The customer receives an electronic receipt. Customers around the world embraced the new model – it was cheap, fast and convenient. In car-struck cities such as Los Angeles, people started getting rid of their cars and relying on ride-hailing apps.

It was good for the customers and bad for traditional cabbies and nobody but the cabbies cared.

But they cared a lot. Taxi drivers and companies rose up in defiance. In Paris, for instance, cabbies protested and smashed up Uber vehicles.

Over the years, the disorganized independent contractors driving for Uber and Lyft started pushing back, too. They formed collectives, such as Rideshare Drivers United, demanding that they be treated as employees. It’s a reasonable assertion. If you work eight hours a day for a single employer, you sure sound like an employee.

When challenged, ride-hailing companies argued that their drivers have a unique amount of freedom and autonomy. Then they would leave – as Uber did in Austin, Texas in 2016. Uber returned a year later when the city had curbed to their demands.

Story continues below advertisement

That was before the age of face masks and hand sanitizer. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, Uber and Lyft have seen their ride-hailing numbers plummet. They’re down by around 75 per cent. The companies seldom if ever made a profit and kept their prices low by subsidizing their rides. It was a smart gambit. Investors envisioned Uber eventually running driverless autonomous vehicles. They’d be to ride-hailing what Netflix (which started out as mail-order DVD rental) was to streaming.

Now, in the middle of a global pandemic, the threat of removing a service few people are using isn’t much of a threat. Besides, taxi companies have modernized. They now use ride-hailing apps.

Essential workers and those living in underserved communities will be most hurt by a service suspension. Usage data from Uber shows that 46 per cent of riders in April were from low-income neighbourhoods. The affluent can desert ride-hailing. The hardest hit communities cannot.

It raises the question of whether enormous companies should have the right to pull up stakes whenever the government issues policy with which they disagree. Uber and Lyft use roads and transit infrastructure, all of which are paid for by taxpayers. They benefit from government spending. Why should they be able to grab the money and run any time they like? Conversely, without Uber and Lyft, a lot of people who presently are making moderate to very little money will be making a grand total of nothing.

And why is the Ontario government considering replacing seldom-used bus routes with companies such as Uber? Dubbed “microtransit” by some possessed wizard living in a cave, the practice involves replacing buses with on-demand ride-hailing. Sounds like a great idea! Why not involve a business model that is under assault, and likely to be a swing issue in the American election, into our provincial public transit system! As we used to say back at Nepean High in 1985, get me fifty bucks of whatever they’re smoking.

We’ll find out soon enough if Uber and Lyft are going to become four-letter words.

I was initially drawn to the Jaguar F-Type, but I am concerned about seat comfort on longer drives and the very small trunk (at a minimum, it has to have enough room for golf clubs). Are the Porsche Boxster or BMW Z4 better options? I would love to have a manual transmission – they are so much fun to drive – but they seem increasingly hard to find on new vehicles, so I’m willing to look at something pre-owned with low mileage. I also looked at the Audi TT, but wasn’t keen on the design. Any other suggestions? – Bruce, Toronto

Gentile: Convertibles – nothing beats them, especially in the summertime. There’s no better feeling than hitting the open road with the wind in your hair and the sun on your skin. I especially love a hard-top convertible because you can drive it year-round.

Richardson: I love convertibles too, but they’re not as practical as fixed-roof cars for exactly Bruce’s concern: the smaller size of the trunk. Remember the worst of them all, the Pontiac Solstice? You could barely fit a sandwich back there.

Story continues below advertisement

Gentile: OMG! Yes, the Pontiac Solstice and its cousin, the Saturn Sky, were useless – not only for trunk space, but interior cabin room, too.

Richardson: They both looked great, but they just couldn’t compete against the success of the Mazda MX-5, mostly because the Mazda had a far more practical trunk. Its roof tucked away into a dedicated compartment.

Gentile: More practical, but still small. Most convertible trunk designs aren’t smart or spacious. When lowered, the roof often eats up valuable cargo space. And some designs are so intricate and complicated, such as BMW’s, which won’t let you overfill the trunk. So it gets frustrating fast, battling storing cargo with going topless.

Richardson: The roof is a lot of cargo, and it has to go somewhere. I like the BMW designs, though – they won’t let you drop the roof if the trunk is too full, but if you need to fill that trunk, you can suck it up and drive with the roof up.

Gentile: What’s the point of a convertible if you’re going to drive with the roof up? I actually don’t like the BMW trunk design because even when the roof is up, there’s still little space in the trunk. If you look at the 4-Series hardtop, when the roof is up there’s some space, but lower the roof and there’s not even enough room for a set of golf bags. It’s useless.

Richardson: Nonsense. I always throw my clubs on the front seat, anyway.

Gentile: Don’t you have any friends or family to bring along for the ride? And I must say, I’m surprised you play golf, too.

Richardson: Well, I’ll admit I have more enthusiasm than skill. But since we’re agreed that convertibles have less trunk space, what would be a decent choice for Bruce? I know there’s room for a small golf bag in the Porsche 718 Boxster trunk, and it’s still sold with a stick shift. He’ll probably need to put his woods on the front seat though.

Gentile: And it has a frunk - aka front trunk. Granted, that space is tiny, too. My purse barely fits in it!

Richardson: Yeah, but I’ve seen your purse. It’s bigger than my airline carry-on bag.

Gentile: Fair enough; I can’t argue with you on that point. Besides the space, the 718 is very well-balanced, nimble, and fun to drive. It does cross off many features on Bruce’s wish list.

Richardson: It’s also much better value than a 911, but moving on, Bruce mentions the BMW Z4, which is about the same money at a base MSRP of $62,900. Its luggage space was lousy when it had a folding hard top, but the new model has a fully accessible 280 litres of space in the trunk when the roof’s up. That’s more than double the space in the Porsche and even the Mazda MX-5, and might be enough for two sets of clubs if they’re not overstuffed.

Open this photo in gallery The BMW Z4 convertible BERNHARD_LIMBERGER/Handout

Gentile: Two sets of golf clubs might be pushing it. But the Z4 definitely has more trunk space than the others. I also like the passenger space in the cabin, too – there’s respectable room to stretch your legs. And the seats are very comfortable, especially on long drives. That’s a must on Bruce’s list.

Story continues below advertisement

Richardson: You know, Bruce is making a hefty demand for space on fancy European roadsters, but if he really wants a convertible with decent trunk room, he should go American. The Ford Mustang convertible has 324 litres of room and a six-speed stick shift. That’s more than half as big again as the Camaro.

Gentile: Sure, the Mustang convertible has more space with two rows of seats, but it’s big and bulky. And it doesn’t have the caché of a BMW or Porsche. Plus, I’m not a fan of the two long doors; it’s easy to ding them on other vehicles in tight parking spots. Judging from his picks, he clearly wants a two-seat roadster.

Richardson: There’s got to be some compromise if he wants the top down and a set of clubs in the trunk. A two-row convertible leaves the entire back seat for the clubs if it’s needed.

Gentile: Clearly, the BMW Z4 is Bruce’s best bet, followed by the Porsche Boxster. But if he really wants more space, go with two rows of seats for those clubs and consider a BMW 4-Series or even a Mercedes-Benz C-Class.

Richardson: The Z4 has more trunk space, but only an automatic transmission. For about the same money, Bruce can get a Boxster with a six-speed manual shifter. He only carries his luggage sometimes, but he’s always using the gear stick, so I know which I’d choose.

After 25 years, the iconic Ford Bronco is back. And the first one out of the gate is the small Bronco Sport 4X4. Here are six cool and unique features you’ll find in the 2021 Ford Bronco Sport SUV.

A tiny camera

Open this photo in gallery A tiny 180-degree camera is hidden in the centre of the front grille. Petrina Gentile/The Globe and Mail

The Bronco Sport’s top trim is dubbed Badlands and is aimed at weekend warriors who want to go off-roading occasionally. It’s no surprise, then, that the Badlands is loaded with useful technology for novice and extreme off-roaders. Smack dab in the centre of the front grille is a tiny 180-degree camera that projects a single or split view on the centre screen in the cabin to help drivers get their bearings when tackling difficult terrain. While all Bronco Sports have a Terrain Management System with five driving modes (sand, slippery, sport, eco and normal), Badlands adds two extra modes: mud/ruts and rock crawl. When you select either mud/ruts or rock crawl, the front camera automatically engages so you can focus on where you’re going with confidence. And if you get into trouble, this trim also has front tow hooks to get you out of a jam.

Flood lights/grab handles

All Bronco Sport models come with a split glass rear liftgate. It’s handy if you want to access the rear cargo area fast. Raise the entire liftgate, and you’ll notice distinct and useful gadgets that are handy for camping, including two directional flood lights that don’t require accessory power to run. Ford officials estimate they’ll illuminate the area for up to 45 minutes. Two large grab handles on the liftgate serve double duty – providing a helping hand to raise or lower the liftgate as well as a spot to hang sports gear or wet towels after a swim.

Bottle opener

Now, here’s a cool feature you won’t find on any other vehicle – guaranteed. Sure, it isn’t easy to spot to the untrained eye, but raise the liftgate, and on the right side near the tail light is a nifty tool that’s perfect for camping or tailgate parties – a built-in bottle opener. It’s a smart gadget that’s nicely integrated into the Bronco’s overall liftgate design, so you’ll never have to search or borrow a bottle opener from strangers ever again.

Hidden storage under the rear seat

If there’s not enough room in the cargo area, there’s extra space hidden in the cabin. You’d never know it, but a small storage bin is tucked away inside the second-row passenger-side seat. Flip up the bottom portion of the seat to reveal a smart spot to store wet, dirty hiking boots or keep valuable items such as cell phones or wallets away from wandering eyes anxious to get a glimpse of the interior. Return the seat to its regular position, and it feels comfy; it’s well-padded and supportive.

Rubberized floors

Worried about getting dirt, grime or mud in the cabin when off-roading? Don’t fret. Clean-up is a cinch thanks to rubberized flooring throughout the interior. A one-piece rubber mat stretches across the entire second-row floor, covering every nook and cranny, to keep the area clean. Likewise, the cargo floor and the back of the rear seats are rubberized, so washing the area is fast and effortless – simply hose it down in seconds. Cloth and leather seat surfaces are also easy to clean or wipe down with a damp cloth. Many of the control switches are also silicone-sealed to withstand the elements.

Roof rack

The Bronco’s black roof rack stands out. It’s bold, sturdy and purposely built not just to carry canoes, skis or snowboards, but also to mount and support a tent on top of the vehicle. It’s the ideal spot to set up base camp. The rooftop tent is one of more than 100 accessories you can add to the Bronco Sport to create a home away from home that’s high up, away from wild animals and snakes. The Badlands trim can also tow up to 2,200 lbs thanks to a more powerful 2.0-litre Ecoboost engine, which pumps out 250 hp and 275 lb.-ft. of torque and is mated to an eight-speed automatic with paddle shifters.

Canadian cities finally getting serious about dedicated bike lanes is one of the (few) pleasant consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Anticipating a decline in public-transit use and increased traffic congestion, municipalities are installing lanes along main routes. The goal is to make cycling not only a healthy way to commute but a quick one. If cycling is faster, more people will leave the car at home.

In Toronto, at least, these new lanes are currently pretty empty, but they’re likely to fill up as people realize they can shop, work and dine without having to find parking and pay parking fees. All it took was the worst pandemic since the Spanish Flu to get Canadian cities to take commuting by bicycle seriously. Who knew?

And so, at this momentous time, may I entreat current and future bicycling zealots to please, in the name of all that is holy, stop executing the “L-turn” at traffic lights?

Story continues below advertisement

Never heard of the L-turn? Perhaps not, but you’ve seen it. The L-turn is a popular move with cyclists around the globe. It’s a little like an old-fashioned wide-receiver route called the “down-out-and-down.” Here’s how it works:

A cyclist arrives at a four-way intersection. He’s facing a red light. Cars are stopped as well.

He cuts across traffic, a few feet in front of the waiting cars, opting to bike across the intersection along the pedestrian-crossing path rather than wait for the light to change.

When the light changes, he bikes forward on the wrong side of the street, going against traffic.

Hence the “L”

The problem with the L-turn is that the cyclist emerges out of a driver’s blind spot. That’s trouble when the light has just gone red, but the real danger occurs when a cyclist does this move out of impatience. They’re tired of waiting for the light to change. So they start their L-turn as the light is just beginning to switch. The drivers are preparing to move forward and then – hey presto – a cyclist appears out nowhere two feet in front of their vehicle. The motorist has no way of knowing the cyclist is coming. It is impossible, for instance, for a driver who is turning left to keep an eye out for a bike darting in front from the right side.

I see this move pulled over and over. Perhaps the cyclists who do it think they’re saving time, but they are taking a risk, one they can ill afford to lose.

The same can be said for cyclists who can’t be bothered to bike on the correct side of the road. If you are riding against traffic and cross into an intersection, the driver who is turning left cannot see you. They are looking at traffic and making sure no pedestrians are in the vicinity. You are coming out of nowhere.

It’s at this point that some cycling advocates shut down. Rather than acknowledge that certain practices are dangerous, they shift the conversation to a discussion of whether or not cars should exist, whether driving should be outlawed in city centres. They pine for the good old days of unpasteurized milk, when typhoid and diphtheria were rife and the horse and carriage were king. Then they are quick to remind us that helmets don’t prevent collisions.

Of course, no one ever said they did. Helmets decrease the severity of certain kinds of head injuries. If you don’t like cars, fine. Next time you need an ambulance, hail a carriage.

Here’s an idea: Instead of doing an L-turn, why not simply occupy the centre lane?

As a driver, that’s my preference. You have every right to be there. Bicycles are vehicles. I can see you clearly. You can make your left turn, and then I can make mine. I’m not excusing all the terrible driving out there. It’s pervasive and far more dangerous.

That said, when it comes to L-turns, this is not a cars versus bicycles debate; it’s a question of a dangerous versus sensible cycling. You can’t pick and choose when you want to obey traffic rules, especially when, if you are a cyclist, the consequences are never going to be in your favour.

“Hey, what’s that?”

The middle-aged man stepping out of the pizza shop startled me as I closed the car door after parking. He was staring intently at my new ride, a 2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer in an eye-wateringly bright robin’s-egg blue. “I love the look, man. I even love the colour.”

A bit surprising, considering he didn’t seem to be part of the demographic for this subcompact crossover. I explained to him that the Trailblazer is all-new for this year, just going on sale this month, but that I couldn’t tell him much because I had just picked it up from a dealer and was on my way home. “Read about it in The Globe and Mail,” I said cheekily.

Well, sir, if you are reading this, I can tell you that you would probably like almost everything about the Trailblazer. Slotting in just above the woeful Trax in Chevrolet’s SUV portfolio, the Trailblazer mimics its Blazer big brother in styling, and in a week of city driving and over a good return highway haul between Toronto and Kingston, I grew more and more impressed with it.

The pizza guy is right, too; it is an attractive little car. More angular and boxy than others in the class, this RS version also has an aggressive grille that could remind you of a Camaro. If you squint.

But it’s the performance that will win over drivers. The base engine is a 1.2-litre three-cylinder coupled to a continuously variable transmission, but this RS has a 1.3-litre three-cylinder with a nine-speed automatic. That may sound tiny, but it packs 155 horsepower and 174 lb.-ft. of torque. In both city and highway travel, it proved more than peppy and seemed happy with spirited driving. The transmission is smooth, though with a stab of the throttle from lower speeds, it takes more than a second to jump down gears and get going.

However, the Trailblazer, especially in top trims, has a bit of a price problem. The $23,698 base price of the LS is on the higher side compared with its subcompact rivals. The LS, with its 1.2-litre engine and standard front-wheel drive (all-wheel drive is optional), lacks some basic standard equipment such as cruise control and a cargo cover. Stepping up to the LT is probably what most people will do, as it’s the best value of the lot with a few more driver aids and comfort features.

The top-tier RS and Activ, both AWD, share the same base price, but here’s the problem: My RS tester, with added Sun and Liftgate package, Convenience package, Technology package and red metallic interior inserts, is a whopping $35,578. Add in freight and taxes, and it’s close to the $40,000 mark. Only the Honda HR-V approaches that price, and it’s thousands more than others in the subcompact-crossover class.

Regardless, this little Chevrolet in its bright-blue paint won over quite a few people, including myself and the pizza guy. With good looks, better-than-average performance and a host of available features, it can be a standout addition to the crowded subcompact crossover segment.

Looks

It’s a winner here, swapping swoopy lines for sharp angles, and the grille configuration with its hexagonal inserts in black gloss has a high-end look. The black plastic cladding is just enough to suggest a more rugged attitude without looking cheap, while the 18-inch alloy wheels add a touch of urban style.

Interior

Open this photo in gallery Rear-seat legroom is best-in-class. Neil Vorano/The Globe and Mail

The Trailblazer has a well-designed and attractive interior, though some panels are still hard plastic. The RS trim has contrasting stitching on the cloth seats, which are a bit tight but still comfortable. The controls are ergonomic, and the cockpit even gets a D-shaped steering wheel. Seats are a bit tight, but legroom for both front and rear passengers is good. Front passengers have ample space, while rear passenger legroom is best-in-class.

Performance

The 1.3-litre is surprisingly peppy, even on the highway, where getting to passing speed is relatively quick after a brief pause for turbo lag. It’s in town that the delay of the nine-speed transmission kicking down a gear is noticeable and sometimes a little disconcerting, especially if you’re making a left turn through an intersection. The ride is decently sprung, but steering is numb and overboosted.

Tech

The LS and LT get quite a few standard driver-assist features such as automatic forward braking, but the RS is fully loaded with many more, including adaptive cruise control and creature comforts such as automatic climate control, eight-inch touch screen and a panoramic sunroof. A small Chevrolet logo is projected on the ground to show you where to swing your foot to activate the automatic lift gate. Of course, you do get what you pay for.

Cargo

Open this photo in gallery The rear seats drop in a 60/40 configuration. Neil Vorano/The Globe and Mail

Overall, the Trailblazer has a respectable 1,540 litres of cargo volume. Not only do the rear seats fold in a 60/40 configuration, but the front passenger seat folds almost flat to accommodate longer items such as a kayak.

The verdict

While the Chevrolet Trailblazer RS is loaded with features, has surprisingly good power and a comfy ride, this one is just too expensive for a subcompact crossover. My money would be with the Trailblazer LT AWD with the 1.3-litre engine.

If we didn’t see this one coming, we should have. FCA has been finding new roles for its supercharged 700-plus-horsepower Hellcat V8 ever since the engine first torched tarmac in the 2015 Challenger and Charger. The 6.2-litre monster motor now also performs in the Trackhawk version of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, will soon play a part in the Dodge Durango and has “guest starred” in aftermarket conversions of the Jeep Gladiator.

But the Hellcat-motored 2021 Ram 1500 TRX is more than just the world’s fastest pickup truck. (Or so FCA claims.) It also aims to rewrite the rule book on truck off-road ability. Going even further, it also represents a new pinnacle trim grade for Ram, offering luxury (e.g. suede and carbon-fibre trim) and technology (e.g. head-up display) not available on even Ram’s previously-ultimate Limited grade.

The mission, said interior design chief Ryan Nagode, was to create a top-dog halo product previously lacking in the Ram line.

The current unchallenged halo-wearer among high-performance off-road pickups is the Ford F-150 Raptor. And “TRX” reads an awful lot like “T-Rex.” See where Ram is going with this? Dinosaur wars!

Canadian pricing has yet to be revealed, but when it goes on sale late this year, U.S. pricing starts at US$69,995 (C$93,000). And yes, that is just a starting point. Ram will provide options to help you spend more. Or try to bag yourself one of the 702 Launch Edition models (100 of them for Canada) that start at $88,570 stateside.

For reference, the Ford Raptor SuperCrew starts at $79,199 and its twin-turbo 3.5-litre V6 is rated at 450 hp; the closest equivalent from GM, a GMC Sierra AT4 with the off-road performance package and 6.2-litre, 420-hp V8, would start at around $70,000.

Available only in a Crew Cab/Short Box configuration, the Ram’s new “apex predator” is founded on a beefed-up frame that is claimed to be 75 per cent new. New aluminum front control arms and upgraded rear axle help widen the track by 6 inches, and TRX-exclusive 35-inch Goodyear Territory tires are sheltered by flared fenders that broaden the body by 8 inches. A 51-mm suspension lift provides 300 mm of ground clearance.

Off-road oriented features and tech include Bilstein Black Hawk e2 active dampers, Active Terrain Dynamics, 8 drive modes (including “Baja” for desert racing), 13-inches of front and 14-inches of rear wheel travel, a tow-hook at each corner, electronic locking rear differential, and a high-mounted alternator to facilitate the 32-inch-deep wading target. The transfer case includes a full-time AWD mode and a 2.64:1 Low Range.

Combine all that with the 6.2-litre supercharged V8′s 702 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque and you have a monster truck that can accelerate from 0-60 mph (96 km/h) in 4.5 seconds, 0 to 100 mph (160 km/h) in 10.5 seconds, and then, at the end of the drag strip, continue across the farmer’s field next door without slowing down.

In case you’re wondering, the engine is 5 hp down on its passenger-car version, mainly due to the pickup’s different exhaust plumbing. Top speed is electronically limited by the tire construction to “only” 190 km/h.

An available digital rear-view mirror is a first for FCA (as is the head-up display) while other visual aids include a forward camera that shows the tire lines for the steering angle, and twiddle-a-knob trailer reverse steering control that doesn’t need a prior set-up process. Speaking of trailers, the max tow rating is 8,100 lbs. Max payload is 1,310 lbs.

In case you’re wondering, the TRX is not (Launch Edition aside) a limited edition. Ram execs say they will build as many as they can sell. Truck enthusiasts are no doubt already in love with it. Environmentalists, not so much.

If your car is hit by an uninsured driver in provinces with public insurance, rest assured – you’re covered, as long as you have insurance.

In British Columbia, for instance, it works the same as in the provinces with private insurance.

Story continues below advertisement

If you're in a crash where an uninsured driver is at fault, your collision insurance, if you bought it, will cover the damages to your car, says the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC).

“The majority of B.C. drivers purchase ICBC’s collision coverage and will get the full benefit of that coverage if their vehicle is damaged by an uninsured or unidentified (hit-and-run) driver,” said Lindsay Wilkins, ICBC spokeswoman, in an e-mail. “The claim would be handled under the collision coverage, and ICBC would waive the deductible.”

But in B.C., there’s recourse if you don’t have collision insurance. “For damage to property other than vehicles, or to vehicles without collision coverage, the statutory fund is available when there is no other coverage available,” Wilkins says.

In B.C., anyone with basic insurance or a valid B.C. driver’s licence has uninsured-motorist protection, Wilkins says.

Unlike uninsured protection in provinces with public insurance, which only covers injuries or has a cap on coverage for vehicle damages, B.C.'s fund covers both injuries and collision damage, Wilkins says.

""For damage to property other than vehicles, or to vehicles without collision coverage, the statutory fund is available when there is no other coverage available,"" Wilkins says.

The fund covers up to $1-million for injuries and property damage if you’re in a hit and run or if you’re hit by somebody who doesn’t have insurance.

Story continues below advertisement

That’s different than Ontario, where you’re only covered for up to $25,000 of the damage to your car if you’re hit by an uninsured driver and you don’t have collision. It’s also different than Alberta, Quebec and the Atlantic provinces, where damage to your car wouldn’t be covered at all if you’re hit by an uninsured driver and don’t have collision insurance.

Even in B.C., the fund won't protect you if you're at fault. If you caused a crash, whether the other driver had insurance or not, your car repairs will only be covered if you have collision protection.

Do you need to sue the other driver first to access the fund?

""For most claims for injury, death or damage to property (including vehicle damage), under the statutory coverage, ICBC will settle directly with the claimant and seek recovery from the uninsured motorist,"" Wilkins said.

Saskatchewan and Manitoba

What about the other two provinces with public insurance?

In Saskatchewan and Manitoba, if you have basic insurance, then you and your car are covered in any collision, whether the other driver is insured or not.

Story continues below advertisement

“In Saskatchewan, a valid registration means you have basic plate insurance on your plates which includes coverage for damage to your vehicle (subject to a deductible), personal-injury insurance from a vehicle collision and liability insurance for damage your vehicle causes to another vehicle or property, or injury to others,” said Tyler McMurchy, spokesman for Saskatchewan Government Insurance (SGI), in an e-mail.

Unlike in other provinces, Saskatchewan and Manitoba drivers don't need to purchase additional collision coverage – damage is covered even if they're at fault.

For instance, in a collision where both drivers have insurance, the at-fault driver would just have to pay the deductible on his vehicle. That deductible is $700 in Saskatchewan and $500 in Manitoba.

If you don't have insurance at all, then your vehicle damage won't be covered.

“If you were breaking the law by driving an uninsured vehicle ... and you were struck by another uninsured vehicle or you were a victim of a hit and run, your vehicle would have no insurance coverage and you’d have to pay for any repairs to your vehicle out of pocket,” McMurchy says. “As a Saskatchewan resident, you’d still have no-fault injury coverage if you were hurt, however.”

In both provinces, if you’re at fault and don’t have insurance, the insurance company could sue you for the cost of the damages to the other vehicle.

With apologies to real estate agents everywhere, only three things seem to matter for electric vehicles these days: range, range, and range.

Charging speed is an issue too, but that’s more often subject to the power of the charging station, not the vehicle. It’s all about never running low on juice when you’re far from a refuelling point.

The biggest batteries on today’s electric vehicles (EVs) have ranges of more than 400 kilometres in normal driving conditions, which is about the same as a tank of gas on a regular car. This is more than enough for most drivers in a normal day. In fact, we’ve been hearing for at least the last 13 years that the usual daily commute in Canada is less than 50 kilometres, which was comfortably covered by the relatively small batteries in the original Chevrolet Volt and Nissan Leaf.

Story continues below advertisement

Open this photo in gallery The basic Prius Prime costs $32,990 (and bumps to $33,150 for 2021). The Globe and Mail

The message hasn’t changed. We’re not driving greater distances, but we are demanding a similar range to gasoline-powered vehicles. We can get it too – at a price. Transport Canada says the all-electric Leaf will travel a claimed 243 km on its regular 40 kWh battery, but if you pay an extra $2,600 for the Leaf Plus, you get the 62 kWh battery and increase the range to a claimed 363 km. Tesla offers even more choice: the current Model 3 offers three all-electric ranges, from 402 km for the $52,990 Standard Plus up to 518 km for the $64,990 Long Range.

And then there are Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), like the Toyota Prius Prime I’ve been driving for the past week.

Open this photo in gallery The Prius Prime is essentially a Toyota Prius hybrid that also has an 8.8 kWh battery. Mark Richardson/The Globe and Mail

The regular Toyota Prius is a traditional hybrid – now in its 20th year of production – that uses a combination of gasoline engine and electric motor to drive the car and thus save on fuel. The battery for the motor is charged by the gasoline engine, and by clever technologies like regenerative braking. The Prius Prime is essentially a Toyota Prius hybrid that also has an 8.8 kWh battery, which can be recharged by plugging it into an electric household socket. When it’s fully charged, it provides about 40 kilometres of all-electric range, but under usual circumstances, it switches back and forth between the gas and electric motors, or uses both together, to provide the best drive for that moment.

Coasting in stop-and-go traffic? It will turn off the engine and run with just electricity. Mashing the pedal to the floor to overtake? It’ll use all the power it can find from both sources. Driving normally? A bit of both should do the trick.

I drove the Prius Prime from Toyota’s head office in Toronto out to my home in the country, and it used up most of the battery’s charge at highway speed on Hwy. 401. When I got home, I plugged it in right away and it took about five hours to fully recharge from the standard 110-volt outlet in my garage.

Open this photo in gallery There’s less space in the trunk thanks to the battery being stored there under the floor, but it’s not bad at 561 litres. The Globe and Mail

For the next few days, I drove errands around town, multiple journeys every day of never less than six kilometres, never more than 20 or so, and I plugged in the Toyota whenever I remembered. Like all EVs, the Prius Prime can be scheduled to only charge at certain hours, when electricity is least expensive, but in these days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ontario’s electricity costs the same at all times of the day and night. An hour of plugging in at 110 volts gave about six kilometres of all-electric driving.

The Prius Prime was a pleasant sedan to drive. It can be set to only-electric, or only-gas, or the usual combination of both. There are three driving modes at the press of a button, Sport, Normal, and Eco, which temper the response of the throttle and the shifting feel of the continuously variable transmission. All-electric is quite peppy and feels great; all-gas feels a little strained unless the drive mode is set to Sport.

There’s less space in the trunk thanks to the battery being stored there under the floor, but it’s not bad at 561 litres. The regular Prius offers 697 litres, but the raised, curved glass on the carbon-composite hatch lid increases the capacity. There’s more space in the rear seat, though: there used to be only two seat belts back there, but this was increased in the 2020 model year to seat belts for three. They’re a bit cramped, but it could be worse.

This was a very clever car, too. It’s loaded with Toyota’s Safety Sense 2.0 driver’s assistance features, including parking assist and active cruise control, and now finally has Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for easier connectivity.

At the end of my week, I drove clear across the top of Toronto for a lunch appointment before returning the car – a 235-kilometre round trip. It took just 30 kilometres to drain the full-charged battery, but I was driving at the 120 km/h speed of traffic, with the air-conditioning at full blast against the day’s 35-degree heat. When the gasoline engine switched on, I carried on regardless and saw fuel consumption of 4.5 L/100 km.

Along the way, I stopped at a Tim Horton’s next to a bank of Tesla superchargers. There was a Model X and a Model 3 plugged in there, with their drivers sitting at the wheels, charging for a high-speed boost of 270 km in just 30 minutes. The Model X driver was on his phone and ignored me; the Model 3 passengers also ignored me as I pulled alongside for a photo. In my experience, Tesla drivers rarely speak to non-Tesla EV drivers, and vice-versa. I left them to wait to finish charging while I got back on the highway.

In fact, I even pressed a button and recharged the battery on the go, which took about 100 km of driving and returned a thirstier 5.9 L/100 km in consumption to do so. Is this cheaper than plugging in? You do the math.

At the end of the day, after a week of driving and 444 km, I put gas in the car for the first time and filled the tank with 16 litres of fuel. In fact, the tank will hold 43 litres, which will provide almost 1,000 km of range before even activating the electric motor and battery.

What was the total cost of driving the Prius Prime? On electric mode, which covered me off for most of the week, it cost less than three cents per kilometre in hydro (that’s with Ontario’s current fixed price of 12.8 cents/kWh). In worst-case all-gas mode, it cost just a bit more than a regular Prius – the Prime does weigh an extra 150 kg, thanks to that big battery.

Open this photo in gallery When it’s fully charged, it provides about 40 kilometres of all-electric range. The Globe and Mail

The basic Prius Prime costs $32,990 (and bumps to $33,150 for 2021), which is a hefty premium over the basic, $28,650 Prius hybrid. It’s not really an apples-to-apples comparison, though, since the better equipped Prime is closer to the $32,050 Prius Technology edition in convenience and comfort features.

So once again, it all comes down to what range you really need. As I learned, you probably don’t need nearly as much as you think you do. But when you do have to go that extra mile, it’s really nice to not sit waiting at a charging station, trying to ignore the guy in the Toyota who’s already on his way.

Nothing says summer like a Ford Mustang convertible. It’s the ideal ride for nostalgic baby boomers looking to recapture their youth. The iconic Mustang is retro in its design, yet modern and muscular with high-tech features and an affordable price tag.

The base convertible, powered by a 2.3-litre turbocharged EcoBoost four-cylinder engine, starts at $32,080. Personally, I’d skip it and move up the ladder to the GT trim. At $47,805, it gets a powerful 5.0-litre V8 engine with 460 horsepower and 420 lb.-ft. of torque. It even comes with a six-speed manual transmission. A 10-speed automatic is optional. There’s also room for four adults and 324 litres of cargo space.

Be careful opening the two long doors. In tight parking spots, it will be easy to ding other vehicles.

2020 Mazda MX-5

Open this photo in gallery Petrina Gentile/The Globe and Mail

If you’re single or a newlywed with no baggage – meaning kids or pets – the Mazda MX-5 is a cute, compact two-seat roadster that spells serious summer fun. Top up or down, it’s attractive from every angle. It’s also lightweight, nimble, well-balanced and sporty, thanks to its 2.0-litre inline four-cylinder engine with 181 horsepower and 151 lb.-ft. of torque driving the rear wheels.

The soft top with a glass rear window is easy to open or close. But if you prefer a hardtop, go for the MX-5 RF, short for Retractable Fastback. Its power roof opens and closes in less than 15 seconds.

Trunk space is tight with only 130 litres of capacity, so stick to short, quick day trips. Prices start at $33,100 for the MX-5 GS RWD with a six-speed manual. The MX-5 RF starts at $40,100.

2020 Jeep Wrangler

Open this photo in gallery Petrina Gentile/The Globe and Mail

For thrill-seeking millennials eager to get off the beaten track, the Jeep Wrangler won’t disappoint. Its go-anywhere, off-road capability adds fun to the mix by transforming from an SUV to a quasi-convertible. The roof and doors come off and the windshield folds down for a true open-air experience. Sure, it takes elbow grease, time and patience to remove the roof and doors, but once that’s done, you’re basking in the sun with the wind in your hair. Plus, it’s a true off-roader, able to tackle anything in its path from water fording to rock climbing.

Prices start at $36,295 for the two-door Wrangler Sport. Skip the two-door models and go for a four-door – it’s more practical and easier to get into the back seats.

Porsche 718 Boxster

Open this photo in gallery Petrina Gentile/The Globe and Mail

Porsches aren’t cheap, but they definitely make a bold statement on the road. The mid-engine 718 Boxster has a new GTS 4.0 trim for 2021 – it’s ideal if you’re recently divorced or going through a midlife crisis and want to turn heads. With serious power, two cozy seats, rear-wheel drive, and a soft-top roof that opens or closes in less than 10 seconds, it’s a hit.

At its heart is a four-litre six-cylinder boxer engine with 394 horsepower and 309 lb.-ft. of torque. It’s powerful and fast, hitting 100 kilometres an hour in only 4.5 seconds. Add a vibrant shade of green or blue and you’ll be impossible to miss. Keep in mind, there’s little room for luggage – the frunk, or front trunk, has enough room for a purse. Prices start at $96,900.

Tesla Model Y

Open this photo in gallery David Zalubowski/The Associated Press

For eco-conscious families who want to go green, an electric vehicle like the Tesla Model Y fits the bill. Smaller than Tesla’s Model X SUV, the Model Y has traditional doors – no gimmicky rear-rising gull-wings. It seats five, but a seven-seat version is expected later this year.

The electric range is impressive. The all-wheel-drive long-range model can travel up to 509 kilometres and go from zero to 100 kilometres an hour in 4.8 seconds. Tesla’s supercharger network system, which makes charging fast and easy on the road, is expanding across Canada. The stations let you recharge the battery quickly – restoring about 275 kilometres of range in 15 minutes. Currently, Tesla has about 155 supercharger stations in Canada, most of them in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia. Prices start at $68,600.

2021 Toyota Sienna

Open this photo in gallery Petrina Gentile/The Globe and Mail

Shocked to see a minivan on this list? Usually minivans aren’t “cool,” but the 2021 Toyota Sienna is an exception. Inside, an optional refrigerator not only keeps beverages cold, it can keep ice cream frozen, too. After the kids make a mess inhaling their cones and other goodies, a built-in vacuum cleaner makes cleanups quick and effortless. It also has a larger rear-entertainment system, 18 cupholders, seven USB keys and 10 airbags.

Getting inside is easier, too. Open or close the rear sliding doors by kicking under the door – no key required. The second-row captain’s chairs also slide forward and back by up to 25 inches for extra room to stretch out. Prices aren’t available yet. But it goes on sale later this year.

The vaguely regal red, black and gold crest that screams “Porsche” in capital letters on the hood does a lot of the selling on the Macan SUV. In case you missed it, the brand name is also writ large across the trunk.

That brand name is why anyone with a bank account that can stretch to afford the lease payment will probably consider this particular compact SUV over the legions of other similarly-sized and similarly-equipped rivals. The brand is strong with this one.

That’s all fine and dandy, but it boggles the mind that Porsche has still tried hard to make this revised Macan Turbo, you know, good. The engineers back in Stuttgart could’ve phoned it in, went off to the beergarden, and the Macan would’ve likely still sold like toilet paper in the early days of the pandemic.

This Macan was Porsche’s best-selling model through the first quarter of 2020. First introduced in 2014, the Macan had its strongest sales year in 2018 with only a slight dip in 2019, according to Goodcarbadcar’s U.S. and Canadian sales data.

First, let’s just ignore the non-sensical nomenclature, shall we? The days when the alphanumeric badges on the back of most German automobiles bore any relation to their engines are long gone. Fine. For Porsche, “Turbo” now simply denotes some of the company’s fastest, most expensive models, which may or may not actually have turbocharged engines. (Shout out to the Porsche Taycan Turbo.)

The sleek Macan Turbo a nice thing to see in your driveway in the morning. It’s modest in the same way a pair of Gucci loafers is modest. They’re well-made, luxurious, comfortable, but at the end of the day still just loafers like this is still just a compact crossover.

Inside, the revised Macan is unfortunately lacking the next-generation, all-glass centre console found in the Taycan, Cayenne and new 911. Some might say there’s a bit too much plastic here in the cabin for a $100,000 car. What’s most troubling about the Macan in day-to-day use are the signal stalks. They feel cheap, with a clunky and imprecise action – very un-Porsche.

A new 2.9-litre engine is ostensibly the headliner on the revised-for-2020 Macan Turbo. It makes 434 horsepower, an 34 hp increase over the old 3.6-litre V-6. The change has more do with the reducing emissions to meet regulatory targets than with making the Macan faster, which it nevertheless does, albeit marginally. With the right option boxes ticked, it will do 0-100 km/h in 4.3 seconds, which is nearly as quick as Porsche’s 911.

The air suspension provides a surprisingly smooth ride even at city speeds. It wasn’t always this way with Porsche, but the engineers seem to have figured out how to make its cars ride reasonably comfortably in the city, and not just on the racetrack. The new 911 Turbo S was similarly cosseting.

Apart from the aforementioned complaints about the cabin, the Macan Turbo is predictably excellent. The only real issue that might give a potential buyer any reason to pause is its price.

The Macan range starts at a modest (for Porsche) price of $57,800, which is only around $10,000 more than fully-loaded Honda CR-V. The Macan Turbo, however, is in another league, starting at $96,500. Our test car, loaded with extras like a full-leather interior ($2,150) and 21-inch wheels ($1,900), came to an eye-watering $119,260 including delivery charges.

A person could get a basic Macan and a Porsche 718 Cayman for about the same amount of money. Alternatively, for $30,000 less, a Macan S with air suspension is 90 per cent as good as the Turbo day-to-day.

The Macan Turbo defies logic and sense, but just like that golden Porsche crest pulls on the purse strings of consumers, so too does the “Turbo” badge.

Interior

The cabin isn’t as fresh looking or as high-tech as newer Porsche models.

Performance

Only the Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio is equal in terms of handling. The Macan Turbo, like most sporty SUVs, makes the driver feel slightly insulated and removed from the action, but the steering is precise and there’s no doubt it could tear up a racetrack.

Technology

On the performance front it’s state-of-the-art, but the infotainment package is par for the course. Canadian fuel economy figures have yet to be published, but during our time with the Macan Turbo we averaged over 12 l/100 km in mostly city driving. Not exactly frugal.

Cargo

The back seats will fit adults just fine, but the rear door opening is small, which would make getting a car-seat in and out a challenge.

Verdict

Among the very best sporty SUVs money can buy, and certainly the best from Porsche.

Minneapolis

Two years is a long time for any vehicle to sit unattended. Seizing brakes, cracked belts and hoses and fluids that have become laden with moisture are just some problems universal to any car that sits. With the vehicle in question being a hybrid, the chances of there being problems is elevated.

The battery minder will slow down the sulfation of your smaller 12-volt battery but not stop it completely. However, this is not a big issue. I’d be concerned about the high-voltage hybrid-battery system, as it will likely become depleted over that extended period. Ideally, if you can contact a friendly neighbour and ask them to drive it for a week or two every six months, this will alleviate most concerns. If this is not possible, then I think you definitely need to get the dealer you mentioned involved, preferably at the midway point.

My VVT-i 2000 BEAMS engine has made a knock sound since the mechanic replaced the timing belt. When I asked him why the sound was happening, he said the head requires shimming. Please help me.

Thank you,

Godfrey

Breakthrough Engine with Advanced Mechanism System (BEAMS) was available in Lexus and Toyota products in Japan and some European markets. I’m not familiar with any of these 2000-cc engines because I don’t believe any made their way to North America, so I am going to assume this reader is on another continent.

Story continues below advertisement

Regardless of this, some things are just universal and don’t require specific product knowledge. I believe that with the statement “knock sound,” you are referring to pre-ignition or ping. The fact that this started after the timing belt was replaced suggests to me that the timing belt was likely installed incorrectly and is now sitting one tooth off.

I have never shimmed a head, nor would I recommend that it ever be done, other than in a racing engine application where a compression ratio needs to be addressed. Go back to your mechanic and insist he revisit his work. If he resists, then you will have to seek a second opinion from another repair facility. Good luck, Godfrey.

What’s on my radar

As internal combustion engines become more complicated, your vehicle’s Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) can illuminate for an ever-increasing amount of reasons. One such item is a newer technology feature commonly known as Variable Valve Timing (VVT), which made its first production-car appearance in the 1990s. Outside of the enthusiast crowd, not many understand this technology, so here is the Lou-lowdown of what it is. That way, if faced with a VVT repair, you’ll at least have a basic idea of what is going on.

For those of you old enough to remember the golden age of muscle cars, one of the most common and easiest engine modifications was to upgrade the exhaust and carburetor. However, serious car enthusiasts often didn’t didn’t stop there and also replaced the stock engine camshaft with a high-lift performance camshaft.

Everyone on the street knew which car had the performance camshaft installed, because sitting behind that car at a set of traffic lights would make your eyes water from the raw fuel smell spewing from their exhaust. The point of the performance camshaft was to make engine valves open further and longer. Enthusiasts liked it because the engine was more powerful when needed, but a downside was that when the engine was idling, it struggled to stay running because it now had too much fuel, hence the reason for the strong odour.

Enter VVT. Some smart engineers started designing engines with camshafts and timing systems that could offer the best of both worlds. They designed a camshaft that had both a normal camshaft profile and a performance profile built into one device. The result was a fuel-efficient car that idled perfectly and also benefited from the extra power provided by a performance camshaft. Every manufacturer now has their own version of it, and just about every newer car on the road makes use of it.

Story continues below advertisement

Engine oil performs double duty in VVT engines. It lubricates and is also used to hydraulically drive the various components that make VVT systems work. Because of that, most problems related to VVT usually have something to do with the oil system and lack of proper maintenance. Extended oil-change intervals don’t help either. Be forewarned, as the importance of being on time with your next oil change is of utmost importance on these engines.

When it comes to habitual drunk drivers, it’s their crime and our punishment.","Darya Selinevich has a problem. The 27-year-old Richmond Hill, Ont. resident likes to drink and drive, and that’s a bit of an understatement.

On Aug 6, she pleaded guilty to criminal charges of impaired driving and driving while disqualified. The judge sentenced her to 18 months in jail and ordered her to take alcohol-addiction counselling. When she is released, she will have a three-year probation and a ten-year driving ban, which means she could be back on the road in as little as a year.

Her crimes?

Story continues below advertisement

In June 2015, she killed a 44-year-old cyclist while drunk driving. Selinevich, then 22, was doing around 110 km/h in a 60 km/h zone and then sped off despite the fact that parts of her victim’s body were embedded in her windshield. As police pursed her, she increased her speed to 200 km/h, crashing her car before fleeing on foot and finally being apprehended.

It wasn’t her first drunk-driving incident. She had been convicted a month earlier and was under a one-year driving ban. The courts had also fined her $1,200. But she kept driving, she later testified, because “she had to get around.”

In 2016, she pleaded guilty to impaired driving causing death, failing to stop at the scene of an accident, failing to stop for police, refusing to provide a breath sample and driving while disqualified. She was sentenced to seven years, which was immediately reduced to four and a half, and eventually she was out on full parole in 2018. She vowed never to drink again.

On June 21 however, witnesses reported a car driving erratically on Highway 400 in Toronto. Police located the vehicle and pulled it over. Selinevich was behind the wheel. She was found to have twice the legal limit in her system and a dozen beer empties in her car. She was charged with five counts of driving while prohibited and two counts of driving under suspension, plus other impaired-driving-related charges.

The worst part is that cases like Selinevich aren’t unusual, and unlike someone who gets wasted and waves a loaded pistol around on their front lawn, these offenders often get away with it over and over again.

In March, for instance, Ontarian Lorne Michael Bruder, 57, was convicted of his eighth and ninth drinking-and-driving offences. He’s been sentenced to a whopping 10 months. In February, 33-year-old Jeffrey Joseph Sacobie from New Brunswick was charged with impaired operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily harm and driving while prohibited. At the time of his collision, which caused his passenger to fly out the window, sustaining serious injuries, Sacobie was under a four-year driving ban and had seven previous convictions for impaired driving. Maybe these guys should get DUI points cards? After a certain number of convictions, they could get a free coffee.

Alcoholism is a disease. It’s an awful, devastating disease. However, if a person suffering from alcoholism is either unwilling or unable to stay out of the drivers’ seat while drunk, why should society pay the price?

Story continues below advertisement

If only Canada had a legal designation for someone who has been convicted of a serious personal injury offence and constitutes a threat to the life, safety or physical and mental well-being of other persons. Someone who shows a pattern of repetitive behaviour for which he or she has been convicted.

In fact, we already do. It’s called being a “dangerous offender.”

The designation carries with it an indeterminate sentence with no chance of parole for seven years. The dangerous offender designation has been reserved for the worst sorts of violent and sexually violent criminals. In 2009, crown prosecutors tried to have Quebec resident Roger Walsh designated as a dangerous offender. A DUI frequent flyer, Walsh had racked up 19 impaired-driving-related convictions and had killed a woman while drunk driving. He received a life sentence but not the designation. Generally, the thinking has been that because drunk drivers don’t mean to kill people, they shouldn’t be designated dangerous offenders.

The thing is, not intending to kill them doesn’t make drunk-driving victims any less dead.

Of course, the legal ramifications for designating habitual drunk drivers as dangerous offenders would be enormous. The susceptibility to abuse would be rife. The crown could misuse it. The designation would place punishment over rehabilitation. Right now, as they read this, lawyers around the country, outraged by my facile take, are spitting up their coffee and hurling expletives around their kitchens.

Relax, everyone. I’m just a columnist, a columnist who is tired of having to write about innocent people being killed by drunk drivers. Habitual drunk drivers and habitual dangerous drivers need to be off the streets. Their freedom should not come at the price of somebody else’s life. The status quo is not enough.

Story continues below advertisement

Besides, the status quo didn’t help Darya Selinevich in 2015 with her first conviction. As twisted as it may sound, she is a victim too. She was a binge drinker, a condition that was said to be triggered, in part, by the deaths of four friends within two years. A stronger intervention at her first conviction might have prevented future carnage. Instead she was slapped with a driving ban that was all too easy to ignore.

When it comes to habitual drunk drivers, it’s their crime and our punishment.

Gentile: Exactly. And Alisha might not like driving the Mustang. It’s way bigger than her little Fiat. She’ll be driving the most, so they’re better off getting a vehicle she’s comfortable in, too.

Richardson: Actually, the seats on a Mustang have a long range of movement, so it would probably fit them both well. I just drove one and loved it. My wife, however, thought it was stupid. She hated that I kept leaving the exhaust sound on Track, which is pretty loud. She told me I was compensating for something.

Gentile: And she would know. But this is a done deal, Mark – both the Mustang and the Fiat are being sold.

Richardson: So their new car probably doesn’t have to be big, but it does have to accommodate both tall and not-so-tall drivers. And it should probably be peppy. Both the ‘Stang and the 500 are fun to drive, so how about a larger Fiat, like the 500L?

Gentile: I like the idea of a larger hatchback like the 500L; it’s spacious with plenty of head- and legroom for taller drivers and passengers. But I’m not a big fan of the ride and handling. It’s a bit choppy and rough over bumps and other degradations on the road. It’s definitely not as fun to drive as a Mustang.

Richardson: The advantage is that Alisha already has a relationship with her Fiat dealer, and the 500L keeps the style of the 500 she says she loves. But maybe she doesn’t like her dealer. What else gives a bit of Euro style with some size and agility?

Gentile: The Mini Countryman might fit the bill for both hubby and wife. It’s stylish, spacious and fun to drive – like a go-Kart! Her hubby would really love it.

Richardson: He probably would. I drove the Countryman a few years ago with my buddy Wade, and he’s a tall guy, so I’m sure Alisha’s hubby would fit. He can try it for size at any dealership, of course, and there’s a new edition for 2021, so he may get a good deal on this year’s models. But Mustang to Mini … those are very different images, and as a guy, that could be quite the jump for the husband to accept.

Gentile: I disagree. I see a lot of guys driving Minis. I think he’ll like its ride and handling - it’s definitely way more fun to drive than a Fiat. So what do you think would be a better “image” for her husband?

Richardson: I’m sure he’d enjoy the larger Mini too. It’s got plenty of rally and performance cred. But if he’s a Mustang guy, he might prefer the looks of a Toyota Camry XSE. Now that’s a surprisingly sporty-looking car that starts around $35,000 and would be practical enough for both of them.

Gentile: Camry? Really? Granted, it’s no ordinary-looking Camry, but it’s still a Toyota. I don’t think he’ll want to go from a Mustang to a Camry. That’ll do nothing for his image. I’m thinking maybe a Subaru WRX?

Richardson: Hmm - I’d forgotten about the WRX. It does get pushed to the side sometimes, but owners love them for their sportiness without being niche. And Subaru’s a bit of an underdog, which would probably satisfy any image concerns of selling out to the mainstream.

Gentile: It would. My pick is the WRX. They’ll both enjoy it!

Richardson: The WRX is right on the money at about $32,000 to start. It’s not so cute like the Mini nor so parental like the Camry. It’s kind of plain on the inside, though, and nowhere near as stylish as either the 500 or the Mustang. These guys might find its looks boring. They also don’t need its all-wheel drive.

Gentile: They don’t need it, but it’s a nice bonus to have in the wintertime. Alisha will appreciate it. And her hubby will enjoy the drive – more sporty than a Mini, Camry or Fiat, for that matter.

I live in Ontario and recently received a Quebec ticket for going 155 km/h in a 100 km/h zone. I’m old enough to know better, and I’m not very happy with myself. I know that the demerit points will follow me to Ontario, but can Ontario charge me with stunt driving as well? – John

If you live in Ontario, some of what happens in Quebec stays in Quebec.

You won't get charged for a Quebec ticket when you get back to Ontario – but you'll get the demerits and the offence will appear on your Ontario driving record. ""While there would be no [Ontario] fines as the offence did not occur in Ontario, there would be demerit points,"" Lee Alderson, a senior issues advisor with Ontario's Ministry of Transportation (MTO), said in an e-mail.

When you're driving in another province, you are subject to the laws and penalties there.

So you’d have to pay fines, and if the offence comes with an instant suspension, police there would take your licence on the spot.

But unless you’ve been suspended because of a Criminal Code violation, that out-of-province suspension won’t apply at home.

Plus, you won't be suspended or fined again for that same offence in your home province.

That’s true even if you got an out-of-province charge for something that normally comes with a higher penalty back home.

For instance, in Quebec, speeding 50 to 59 km/h over the 100 km/h limit gets you a $290 fine. Because it's less than 60 km/h over the 100 km/h limit, it's not considered excessive speeding in Quebec. But in Ontario, speeding more than 50 km/h over the limit is considered stunt driving and comes with a minimum fine of $2,000, up to six months in jail, a two-year licence suspension and an immediate seven-day suspension when police pull you over.

""The offence would have had to occur in Ontario to be subject to that penalty,"" Alderson says.

Demerits in most provinces

Speeding tickets also come with demerits. Whether you get them for an out-of-province ticket depends on where you live and where you got the ticket.

Most provinces and territories signed the Canadian Driver Licence Compact (CDLC), a 1990 agreement to share demerits and driving records.

So if you live in Alberta and got a speeding ticket in Newfoundland, for instance, it would appear on your record,

But British Columbia, Quebec and Nunavut didn't sign the CDLC.

That means that B.C. and Nunavut don’t share traffic tickets with any other provinces or territories. So if you live outside B.C. and you get a B.C. speeding ticket, you won’t get demerits, and it won’t appear on your driving record.

Likewise, B.C. drivers won't see out-of-province tickets on their records. This only applies to provincial offences. Any driving-related Criminal Code convictions, including impaired driving, appear on your driving record everywhere in Canada.

Story continues below advertisement

While Quebec didn't sign the CDLC either, it has separate agreements to share information with Ontario, Maine and New York.

“Ontario and Quebec have a conviction-exchange agreement where select offences, such as speeding, are sent back to the driver’s home jurisdiction,” Alderson says. “In this example, the information would be sent to Ontario and applied to the offender’s Ontario driving record.”

Like any other conviction, it will stay on your record for three years.

Only certain convictions are shared, including speeding, careless driving, running a red light and racing. You will also get the equivalent demerits added to your licence.

So if you’re an Ontario driver, that Quebec ticket for speeding 55 km/h over the limit will get you six demerits in Ontario, even though the offence only carries five demerits in Quebec.

Demerits affect your licence. For instance, if you get more than 15 demerit points in Ontario, your licence could be suspended for 30 days. Why does all this sharing matter? Once an out-of-province conviction appears on your driving record, your insurance company can use it to raise your rates.

Story continues below advertisement

“If you are convicted of racing or stunt driving, you will now be in the ‘high risk’ insurance market,” said Anne Marie Thomas, senior manager of partner relationships at Insurance Hotline, a rate-comparison site. “The premium increase could be as much as two or three times what you were paying before.”

Whenever I hear experts crowing about the wonders new automobile technology will bring, I’m reminded how badly drivers use the technology they already have. The most striking example is the turn signal.

A significant portion of drivers can be divided into two categories:

Those who never use their turn signals when they turn. Those who never turn but have their turn signals on all the time.

How can motorists mess this up? You just pull the handle and the clicking noise starts!

Story continues below advertisement

While some driving transgressions are rare (such as driving the wrong way on the highway), the misuse of turn signals is as common as black flies in June. During any trip, you’re going to see drivers who change lanes and do not signal, or who turn left or right and do not signal. One trait they all share is an indignant alarm when the rest of the world almost crashes into them.

The other day a fellow in a Subaru almost smashed into me. I was turning right, he was – apparently – turning left. Sure, I had the right of way, true, a driver should not turn left into the far lane, but at least if I had known he was going to execute these poor manoeuvres I could have been prepared. He glared at me as he turned. Pal, how am I supposed to know where you’re going if even you don’t?

We’re talking about a piece of technology that has been around almost as long as the automobile. In America, Canadian-born silent film actress Florence Lawrence invented an “auto signal” in 1914 (she also invented the brake light). Sadly Lawrence, who was known as the world’s “First Movie Star,” failed to patent either. In Europe, there were “trafficators” starting in the 1900s. Buick installed its “Flash-Way Directional Signal” in 1939. Turn signals have been mandatory for over 50 years. They are easy to understand and use. People who are technically savvy enough to be distracted by their mobile devices while driving should be able to grasp their use.

Again, I ask, how are people struggling with the concept?

What do face masks, turn signals and condoms all have in common? If you don’t use them as intended they don’t work. The name is a giveaway. When you intend to “turn” you “signal” to communicate with other drivers. You don’t signal after you turn, as some do, you don’t start signalling as you are turning, you signal before you turn or change lanes.

You know who really needs motorists to use their turn signals? Truckers. That’s because they do not wish to collide with automobiles that suddenly pop from one lane to the next without signalling. It is far from an innocuous transgression. The New York Times reported in 2019 that, in the previous year, 542 collisions in New York State involved signalling violations.

A 2006 study by American car insurer Response Insurance found that 57 per cent of drivers admitted to not using their signals. The reasons? Pretty much what you’d expect.

Story continues below advertisement

“Don’t have enough time” (Number one with 42 per cent)

“Lazy” (Second with 23 per cent)

“Changing lanes too frequently to bother”

“Not important”

“Because other drivers don’t”

“Adds excitement to driving.” (My personal favourite)

Is there reason for hope? The New York Times concluded, “Turn-signal nirvana may not arrive until autonomous cars do, when drivers have been removed from the decisions. Experts at companies developing self-driving technology said that the capacity to trigger the appropriate signals when turning or changing lanes would be part of any fully autonomous driving package. The same applies to responding to the turn signals of other cars. Laziness will not be a factor.”

Call me old-fashioned but machines are changing – not people.

Wherever human beings can be found doing things, laziness will always be a factor.

It’s one of our defining characteristics.

In the meantime, let’s all wake up, have a proverbial cup of coffee and remember to use our turn signals.

You recently wrote a story about sales tax on used vehicles. What possible justification could there be for double-taxing a product? The original owner has already paid sales tax on the full purchase price. – Bill

In every province except Alberta, you have to pay provincial sales tax when you buy a used car.

Depending on the province, that means you'll pay as much as 15 per cent in provincial tax on a private sale – and that's way too taxing, experts say.

Story continues below advertisement

""Consumers sell vehicles at a loss,"" said George Iny, president of the Automobile Protection Association (APA), in an e-mail. ""Private sales for which no profit is made should incur no sales tax in a GST or HST system.""

Since taxes are complicated, here's a quick Sales Tax 101.

When you buy a used car through a dealer, you have to pay both the 5-per-cent federal sales tax (GST) and the provincial sales tax, the same way you would if you bought a new car.

That’s because the used-car dealer is a commercial business. It means you could be paying, tax-wise, anything from 5 per cent in Alberta, which doesn’t have a provincial sales tax, to 15 per cent in the Atlantic provinces, where there’s a 10-per-cent provincial sales tax.

In Ontario, for instance, you’d pay the 13-per-cent HST – the combined 5 per cent GST and 8 per cent PST.

That means on a $10,000 2011 Camry in Ontario, you’d pay $1,300 in HST. Of that, $500 goes to the feds and $800 goes to the province.

However, Ottawa doesn’t actually charge GST on private car sales, so you could be forgiven for assuming that you would pay less if you bought from somebody off of an online marketplace such as Kijiji.

Story continues below advertisement

That's only true in four provinces. You'd pay just the 9.975 per cent provincial sales tax in Quebec, 7 per cent in Manitoba, 6 per cent on sales over $5,000 in Saskatchewan and nothing at all in Alberta.

So, if you bought that Camry in a private sale, you’d pay an extra $997.50 in Quebec, $700 in Manitoba, $600 in Saskatchewan and nothing in Alberta.

Special tax just for private sales?

Other provinces charge a special, higher provincial sales tax on private car sales. It adds 5 per cent to the usual sales tax, but it all goes to the province.

So, on a private sale, you would pay 12 per cent PST in BC, 13 per cent RST (Retail Sales Tax) in Ontario and 15 per cent in the Atlantic provinces.

Generally, you’re paying tax on whichever is more – the sale price or the wholesale value of the car.

Since you pay the tax when you register the vehicle, you can't avoid it by buying a car in another province.

Story continues below advertisement

So why's the tax higher for private sales in some provinces?

""The [used car] dealers lobbied to have the consumer tax increased and to apply book values to consumer vehicle sales,"" the APA's Iny says. ""[That] makes it more attractive to trade in your vehicle to a dealer rather than sell it for more privately.""

In some provinces, dealers also get tax credits. That means they may end up paying taxes on just the profit on the sale, Iny says.

The Ontario Used Car Dealers Association and Ontario Ministry of Finance didn't immediately answer questions for this story.

Iny says dealers argue that a higher tax has another benefit – it discourages unlicensed used-car dealerships from posing as private sellers.

But since there are already laws against that, an extra tax is overkill, says the Canadian Taxpayers Federation (CTF).

Story continues below advertisement

“Used-car dealerships just don’t want to be at a tax disadvantage,” says Aaron Wudrick, CTF federal director. “They say it would make them uncompetitive – but if it’s just grandma selling her used car, then they overstate their case.”

Since other private sales of goods aren't taxed, there shouldn't be a provincial sales tax at all on private vehicle sales, Wudrick says.

“You don’t have to push governments too hard to add taxes if there’s a chance for more revenue,” Wudrick says. “I just think we need to be careful around treating a one-off sale as if it were a commercial sale – that makes life more expensive.”

Elaine M, Ottawa

I am familiar with carbon built-up engines – your Subaru being one of them – and that familiarity leaves me with doubt that you are dealing with a carbon-related issue. As far as I am concerned, dissembling the engine to manually check and clean all potential trouble spots would essentially eliminate any carbon-related misfires for an extended period. The fact that you are having these issues at such a low mileage and that the CEL reappeared after the engine’s disassembly, suggests to me that the problem is elsewhere. Your extensive repair list also leads me to believe that neither Subaru Canada nor the dealer has any clear path to a solution. I am hopeful for you that Subaru Canada has been footing the bill on all these costly repairs. Stick with CAMVAP, as that seems like your strongest option right now, but perhaps widen the scope of your case to include all potential misfire sources.

Hi Lou,

I really enjoy your articles. I have a 2010 Mazda 5 with 270,000 km on it. My problem is an intermittent blinking SRS airbag light. It blinks a few times then stops. It blinks for days then stops for weeks or months. Mostly it blinks 42 times, but sometimes it is 43 or 32. I’m hesitant to spend a fortune trying to fix this on a car of my Mazda’s age. Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Dave R, Muskoka

I would need the related codes as displayed by a diagnostic scan tool to be sure, but I can discern a bit of information from the codes displayed by counting the blinks as you have done. Codes 42 and 43 translate into a faulty front-driver’s-side crash sensor. Code 32 does not seem to be valid. This sort of repair is best left to a professional or, in the very least, a very well-informed DIYer. The sensor in question is located in the front bumper area and is likely moisture damaged. If it is just a sensor problem, I don’t imagine the cost will be that scary. The clock spring, which is the part in behind the steering wheel, is actually the more common repair.

To be clear, when any vehicle, regardless of manufacturer, has a Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) light that is on, solid or flashing, this indicates that the SRS is in fault mode and the air bags may not deploy in the event of a collision.

What’s on my radar

Open this photo in gallery Lou Trottier's old Volkswagen-based Puma, the platform for his first EV-conversion project. Lou Trottier/The Globe and Mail

Call it futureproofing, or perhaps simply trying to keep up with the times, but the time to convert my first fossil-fuel-powered car to all-electric has arrived. This decision was influenced by reader feedback here and my own community of customers and friends who seem to have an ever-growing thirst for electric-vehicle information. It is my belief that there is a developing market in this field.

Story continues below advertisement

That being said, my unhurried research phase took a couple of years. I began by looking to California-based companies that specialize in electric-vehicle (EV) conversions for inspiration.

Californians enjoy near-perfect weather year-round, with plenty of winding roads to boot. These two factors mean that their car culture is second to none, and they enjoy an abundance of forward-thinking custom-car shops.

I started out looking in the direction of vintage air-cooled Volkswagens, which have achieved an almost cult-level status in the EV-conversion community. Their mechanical simplicity has made them obvious candidates for many conversion projects.

Open this photo in gallery After the chassis is completed, a battery box will be built and an electric motor installed. Lou Trottier/The Globe and Mail

I eventually settled on a Puma, which is not quite a vintage Volkswagen, though it is a close cousin. My initial choice, a 60′s split-window VW bus, had skyrocketed in value over the last several years leaving very few suitable, affordable donors. Puma was a Brazil-based sport-car company that built fibreglass-bodied cars using a running gear and chassis sourced directly from Volkswagen. The original Puma factory struggled with floods and fires, causing production to dwindle from 400 to 100 units per month. By 1986, it was all over, leaving this small-volume manufacturer to fade into obscurity. The upside is that easy-to-restore candidates are plentiful as they have yet to experience a dramatic increase in value. A decision was made to buy two cars from one owner; an unfinished project car and a second parts car arrived at my garage in late 2019 from Nova Scotia.

Mechanical staff is now close to finishing the initial restoration of the floor pan and chassis. Preparation is underway to confirm proper alignment of the floor pan to the body, which will lead to the next step, which is to restore and renew the suspension and running gear. Once we have a complete, usable rolling chassis, we will move on to designing and building a suitable battery box. While this is happening, I am steadily working away at sourcing batteries, electronics and an electric motor.

More details here as they develop.

Let’s just get this out of the way right now. The Jeep Wrangler is noisy, bouncy and – if you drive the two-door – hopelessly impractical. Fortunately, at least four out of five buyers choose the four-door Unlimited, so for them, the back seat is easy to reach, and it’s just noisy and bouncy.

It’s also very expensive. The two-door Wrangler I drove recently listed at more than $65,000 before tax, after adding $17,000 worth of mostly comfort and cosmetic options. The four-door Gladiator I also drove recently listed at more than $68,000, with almost the same optional extras.

They were expensive because they were both the Rubicon version of the trucks – the strongest, hairiest-chested Jeeps you can buy. When I told my kids I’d be driving a pair of Jeeps, they both asked if they’d be Rubicons – “they’re the good ones,” they said. When my cousin bought a new Jeep last year to drive around downtown Montreal, she made sure to order a white Rubicon. “That’s the one to get,” she said, ignoring my advice because she wanted that name on the hood.

There are actually four different trim editions of the Wrangler, starting with the cheapest two-door Sport at about $36,000 and going up to the stratospheric heights of my two testers. All are highly capable, but while the Sport and Sport S are fairly normal and the Sahara is the most comfortable, the Rubicon has the extra off-road chops. It has a two-speed transfer case, solid Dana rear axles, rock-protector rails, 33-inch three-ply tires, extra underside protection and all kinds of other tough stuff.

The problem is that all that off-road strength takes away from the comfort of the vehicle when it’s on the highway, which for most owners is most of the time (for my cousin, it’s all of the time). I live in the country, and I drove both Jeeps along some pretty rough rural access trails that they handled easily, but I rarely needed to even put them in 4WD. Their biggest advantage over other vehicles was their 277-mm clearance height for driving over rocks and ruts.

A couple of years ago, I drove the new Rubicon on the Rubicon Trail itself, a 19-kilometre route in California above Lake Tahoe that truly showed the remarkable capabilities of the Jeep. I took it over boulders and around rocks that I would never have attempted without others alongside to help if I got into trouble. Jeep clubs here in Canada also love driving on challenging trails, but you’ll have to earn your stripes to make new friends; the most appreciated Wranglers are put together carefully and thoughtfully with aftermarket accessories, not bought off-the-shelf from the local dealer.

So my point is you almost certainly don’t need the Rubicon edition of the Wrangler or the Gladiator, though the bragging rights are huge and their resale values are among the best in the country for any vehicle. It will be more relaxing to drive a Sahara or a nicely-appointed Sport S, and you won’t be looked on with derision if your Rubicon is clean and unscratched.

That said, there are many advantages to driving a Wrangler or a Gladiator on the road. (The Gladiator is basically a Wrangler with a pickup-truck bed at the back, but it’s not officially listed as a Wrangler.) The turning circle is very tight, allowing for worry-free U-turns in the city. The driving height is way up high, letting you see far down the highway. And the extreme approach and departure angles at front and back mean you’ll never scrape the underside on a concrete divider at the mall; you’ll just drive over with a self-congratulatory smirk. At least, you could if you wanted to.

Those are the positives, and of course there are negatives, too. It’s a tall climb up into the seat, so you can’t be too doddery. The drive on those 33-inch BF Goodrich trail tires is loud and squishy, and they’ll cost more than $300 each to replace. The quality of the sound system is rendered useless by the noise of the road, which will have you checking if the windows are closed, even though they are. (Is that the last external wire antenna available on a vehicle in Canada?)

Fuel consumption is much improved from previous generations but still awful. The manual transmission gives poorer economy than the automatic, officially rated as low as 12.2 L/100 km for average use on the manual four-door, but my own lead-footed consumption was worse than that. Now Jeep has announced a 6.4-litre V8 Rubicon concept vehicle for those who want 450 horsepower while climbing rocks.

And then there are the doors, the Wrangler’s tour-de-force. Until the Ford Bronco comes on sale, they’re the only doors on a production car that remove entirely, which is great for driving in the summer but not so good for driving in a summer rain storm. When opened, they have only a canvas strap to stop them from swinging right around on their hinges, which means they’ll shmuck into the car parked alongside at the mall in a windy moment of inattention.

Really though, who cares? You buy a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon for its image and the feeling that image reflects back onto yourself. Its brand is one of the strongest in the industry and now its cost reflects that. Perhaps the new Bronco will finally give it some competition, but don’t expect its price to come down anytime soon. A new Rubicon is a wealthy driver’s toy. It’s just too bad so few of them will ever get to prove their worth.

Driving with a truck with the tailgate down probably isn’t illegal, but it could be a real drag.

In Ontario, there’s no law specifically against driving with your tailgate down, trunk open or SUV hatch up, as long as you’ve properly secured any loads. “The Highway Traffic Act (HTA) doesn’t specifically prohibit a particular position of a tailgate or trunk/hatch,” said Michael Fenn, senior issues advisor with the Ministry of Transportation (MTO), in an e-mail. “However, section 84 specifies that the vehicle must be in a safe condition – stability and visibility must not be compromised.”

If a cop decides that your vehicle is unsafe, you could face fines up to $5,000.

Any load that you’re carrying in your truck bed, open trunk, open SUV hatch, trailer or on the roof have to be “loaded, bound, secured, contained or covered so that no portion of the load may become dislodged or fall, leak, spill or blow from the vehicle.”

Fines for unsecured loads on passenger vehicles are $100­ to $200, Fenn says.

“Your cargo needs to be secured, and you need to be able to have a view to the back with at least one mirror,” said Sgt. Kerry Schmidt, with Ontario Provincial Police highway safety division, in an e-mail. Schmidt said he wasn’t aware of cases where an open tailgate caused a crash, but crashes have definitely been caused by objects flying off vehicles and trailers.

Last year, on Highway 410 near Toronto, a sheet of plywood flew off a small utility trailer and through the windshield of a Volkswagen Jetta. Nobody was seriously hurt. If a load sticks out more than 1.5 metres from your vehicle, you need a red light at night and a red flag during the day.

Open and shut case?

While each province has its own rules, most are similar to Ontario’s – there are no specific rules about whether tailgates have to be closed, but loads have to be secure.

In British Columbia, for instance, driving with an unsecured load in a passenger vehicle could deliver an up to $598 fine.

B.C. RCMP say crashes caused by unsecured loads aren’t common, but they do happen. For instance, police say they’ve seen bikes and kayaks fly off vehicles and hit the vehicles behind them.

But if you’re not carrying a load that’s so long that you can’t close your tailgate, why would you keep it open?

According to Internet theories, driving with the tailgate down might improve your truck’s fuel economy. The idea is that the closed gate causes drag, which makes your truck’s engine work harder and use more gas.

But that idea is mostly a myth, according to a 1999 study by National Research Council (NRC) researcher Kevin Cooper. While there are ways to reduce drag, such as driving with a tonneau cover, driving with the tailgate down can actually do the opposite, especially on trucks with shorter boxes.

That’s because automakers design trucks so air flows over the tailgate. The air needs to bounce off the top of the tailgate, otherwise, it pools in the truck bed, creating drag. In Cooper’s tests with a six-foot box, lowering it increased drag by five per cent ­– and using a mesh tailgate cover increased it by another five per cent.

The commute as we know it may never be the same. All manner of transportation options are vying to fill the void as people stay away from public transit due to the pandemic. Instead, more urban residents may consider new devices like e-bikes and e-scooters, as well as old ones like bicycles and cars.

COVID-19 will accelerate the transition to some new transportation modes and services, according to panelists at the recent Collision from Home technology conference in Toronto.

“Safety is going to be a primary concern, and so public transit [ridership] will go down; there will be a need for other types of transit,” said Paul Asel, managing partner of venture capital firm NGP Capital, which has invested in several mobility startups, including Lime and Scoop.

In cities across the country, the coronavirus pandemic caused an unprecedented drop in transit ridership. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently issued new guidelines encouraging businesses to offer employees incentives to avoid commuting by public transit or ride-sharing.

Bicycle sales jumped in April, well above last year’s numbers, according to a report from research firm CB Insights. Montreal, Vancouver, Toronto and other Canadian cities are giving over more road space to create new bike lanes and pedestrian zones.

At the same time, several studies show more people who don’t currently own cars are looking to buy one as a result of the pandemic. Canada-wide data published by Apple Maps suggests people are increasingly choosing to drive or walk, rather than take public transit, as cities across the country re-open.

The risk here is that if more people abandon transit for cars – the vast majority of which still run on fossil fuels – not only will that mean even worse traffic and longer commutes, but it would increase pollution and accelerate the world toward a climate crisis.

MICROMOBILITY’S BIG CHANCE

Micromobility companies that provide e-bikes and e-scooters – either privately owned or as part of shared fleets – see this as a chance to break into the mainstream.

“We’re seeing a very significant uptake in micromobility in the cities that are coming back,” Paul Asel said at Collision. “We’re seeing longer rides, longer duration and more frequent use, which would indicate that we’re seeing different types of commute patterns emerging to supplements the public transit.”

Companies such as Lime and Bird that offer shared, dockless e-scooters (the kind you stand up on) have been hit hard by the pandemic, having shut down service in many cities and laid off employees. Even before the pandemic, they had struggled to turn any profit, according to a report from Ark Investment Management. The pandemic could be a make-or-break moment for shared e-scooters.

Li Fan, chief technology officer at Lime, was optimistic. “We have seen very encouraging signs from markets like, say, Seoul, which is an early market to re-open – the usage is already more than [it was] pre-coronavirus,” Fan said, speaking at Collision. She noted that cities around the world are pushing to expedite the creation of infrastructure for bicycles and scooters.

“We will take this trend and really show to riders and governments that we provide a much more efficient and reliable way for people to get around,” Fan added.

Sales of personal e-scooters – which range in price from around $900 to $3,500 – are booming at Vancouver’s Urban Machina, a retailer and distributor. The shop’s founder, Ambrose Tham, said sales are up 30 per cent compared to this time last year.

“We have customers that are purchasing these to avoid commuting on public transportation,” Tham said, “but we have also seen an increase in leisure use, especially for taking on road trips and RVs.”

Demand for e-bikes – the electric bicycles you need to pedal, not the bigger Vespa-style scooters – is also surging right now.

“A big part of the interest in e-bikes in general is COVID-related right now,” said Kevin McLaughlin, chief executive officer of Zygg, a new e-bike subscription service that provides users an e-bike for $69 per month. The service launched in Toronto in June.

“Long-term changes are hard to predict, but I do think that the pandemic has ‘sped up’ things that many of us have been working on for a long time – like better and safer biking infrastructure, and slow streets,” McLaughlin said via e-mail.

TRAFFIC JAMS

What exactly the commute of the future looks like still depends on some big unanswered questions.

For one thing, the pandemic has made it clear that working from home is possible for many people. How many of them will go back to the twice-daily commute once this is all over? Nobody knows.

For another thing, winter is coming. How well open-air vehicles like e-bikes and e-scooters catch on in Canada as genuine year-round alternatives to public transit remains to be seen. In part, it will depend on how well cities accommodate them.

And, finally, the shift away from public transit may not last, as Jay Walder said. He is currently chief executive of Virgin Hyperloop One, but was previously the head of public-transit agencies in New York, London and, most recently, Hong Kong. “Eight, nine years after SARS, the ridership [in Hong Kong] was at all-time highs,” Walder said at Collision. It took time for people to rebuild their confidence in public transit, he said, but eventually people returned.

I see ads on American TV for pay-per-mile insurance, where you just pay for how much you drive. The ads sound great; it really makes sense, especially now. Is that really how it works? Do any Canadian companies offer this? If not, why? – Rajinder, Ottawa

In Canada, we don’t have the option to buy insurance by the mile – or in our case, by the kilometre. The technology is already used here, but the rules in most provinces don’t allow it. “The regulations in the United States allow for companies to price per mile,” says Ryan Stein, executive director of auto-insurance policy and innovation at the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC). “In Canada, our regulators decided they want to take a more cautious approach.”

Pay-per-mile insurance uses a telematics device that's attached to your car and sends information to the insurance company – including mileage, when you drive, speed and how hard you brake.

Story continues below advertisement

Pure pay-per-mile insurance, offered by two U.S. companies, charges you a base monthly rate and then, on top of that, charges you for the actual distance you drive.

“There’s a monthly base rate,” Stein says. “So if you’re paying $200 a month now, your base rate would be a fraction of that.” For instance, on the website for Metromile, a U.S. company that only offers pay-per-mile insurance, a fictional 40-year-old male driving a 2015 Honda Fit in Seattle would pay a base rate of US$53 a month. Then there would be charges of 6.7 US cents per mile up to 250 miles (402 km) per day. So, driving 50 miles (80 km) a month would raise the total bill to US$56. At 200 miles (322 km), it would be US$67.

Telematics for discounts only

Since 2012, several Canadian insurance companies have offered telematics, but, in most provinces, they can only use them to give you a discount – not to set your rates. ""You get priced as you always would, but you'll get a discount if you drive safely,"" Stein says.

Stein says provincial insurance regulators in Ontario, Alberta, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland should change the rules to allow pay-per-mile insurance. That means they can't use telematics data to add to your bill.

“I don’t believe there are rules against it in Quebec or New Brunswick, but most of the insurance companies are national,” Stein says. “If it were allowed in more of the major markets, that could have implications for the rest of the country.” Pay-per-mile insurance “isn’t for everybody,” because higher-mileage drivers wouldn’t save anything – but it would make sense for people who don’t drive often, Stein says.

""Look at what happened during the pandemic – people went from commuting every day to barely driving,"" Stein says. ""If you had pay-per-mile insurance, your premium would just automatically be lower without you having to let your insurance company know.""

Pay as you go?

In Ontario, CAA Insurance has been offering MyPace, a pay-as-you-go plan, since 2018. It’s not exactly pay-per-mile, but it lets you pay a base rate, and then pay a fixed amount for every 1,000 kilometres you drive.

Story continues below advertisement

The company calculates your premium the same way it normally would – based on your car, driving record, age, gender, annual mileage and where you live – but breaks it into 1000-km segments. For instance, if you normally pay $1,100 per year, you would pay an annual base rate of $200 and then $100 for every 1,000 km, CAA says. You get notices as you get closer to the 1,000 km threshold. Once you’re over, you automatically buy the next 1,000 km. “If you only drive 5,000 km in a year, you’ll save 30 per cent,” says Matthew Turack, president of CAA Insurance. Turack recommends the plan for people who drive less than 9,000 km a year. If you drive more than than that, you will pay a surcharge – CAA says it’s about $8 or less – for every additional 1,000 km.

“This fee will put you above the price of our traditional auto insurance policy,” CAA’s website says.

Turack says rules aren’t the reason CAA Insurance chose pay-as-you-go instead of pay-per-mile. “We’ve never had any resistance from the regulator,” Turack says. “CAA Insurance didn’t go to billing for individual kilometres because of feedback we saw in the States, where consumers were surprised at their bills at the end of the month.”

As electric vehicles (EVs) continue to gain acceptance among consumers, automotive manufacturers and recyclers are grappling with a new issue – what to do with millions of tonnes of used batteries.

Over the next 20 years, the projected global volume of spent lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles alone will increase to more than seven million tonnes annually, according to the Reponsible Battery Coalition, a Milwaukee-based advocacy group that represents companies that make, use, sell or recycle batteries used in the transportation and industrial sectors. In Canada alone, the number of end-of-life EV batteries could be as high as 210,000 by 2030, according to Propulsion Quebec, the province’s government-led incubator for electric and smart transportation.

Landfills are not an option because EV batteries are chemically unstable and prone to burning if mishandled, and battery recycling is still in its infancy. Only two such facilities currently serve all of Canada, with a capacity of about 12,000 tonnes a year. Capacity of between 40,000 and 63,000 tonnes would be required to properly handle the number of batteries Propulsion Quebec believes will accumulate across Canada.

Several factors work against EV-battery recycling, says Andrew Abbott, a professor at the University of Leicester in Britain who co-wrote a 2019 study looking at the potential EV battery-recycling crisis. First, as the study points out, each battery weighs about 250 kilograms, and it’s difficult to untangle the wiring from the valuable metals inside. Second, the used batteries still carry a significant electrical charge, which can pose a danger to workers. Third, the batteries are not standardized.

Individual battery cells are combined into modules which are then assembled into battery packs. As a result, “there is enormous variety in the chemistries, shapes and designs of lithium-ion batteries used in EVs,” says Gavin Harper, a research fellow at the University of Birmingham and Abbott’s co-author.

“To recycle these efficiently, they must be disassembled and the resulting waste streams separated.” Along with lithium, the batteries employ numerous other valuable metals, such as cobalt, nickel and manganese.

Another obstacle to recycling is the recent push to eliminate or reduce the use of cobalt – a conflict mineral – in lithium-ion batteries, according to Maria Kelleher, principal of Toronto-based environmental-consulting company Kelleher Environmental. Manufacturers seeking to clean up their supply chains and comply with human-rights pledges are pushing for the development of batteries that can use metals other than cobalt. But as the amount of cobalt in the used batteries drops off, they will become less valuable to recyclers. “If there’s no cobalt, there’s nothing of value to recycle,” Kelleher says.

There is good news, however. Far from being spent, lithium-ion batteries retain between 60 and 80 per cent of their charging capacity when the vehicle’s life on the road is over. Recognizing this opportunity, most auto and battery manufacturers, alongside independent researchers and specialist firms such as Oklahoma City-based Spiers New Technologies, which refurbishes and remanufactures used EV batteries, are investing in research into the commercial reuse of used EV cells.

BMW, for example, has installed material-recovery systems for end-of-life vehicles in 30 countries. The company says it is achieving an 85-per-cent reuse and material-recycling rate. “We do not consider end-of-life vehicles as waste to be disposed of, but as a secondary source of raw materials,” says Thomas Becker, BMW Group’s vice-president of sustainability and mobility.

At Audi AG, engineers have been experimenting with reusing EV batteries for material-handling equipment in their manufacturing plants. They are also looking at how used batteries could be employed for auxiliary and buffer storage on local power grids.

“What this means is that some batteries bound for recycling could end up being reused on the power grid for a while first,” says Alexander Kupfer, a project leader in sustainable product development at Audi. “Only once they can no longer serve this function would they be broken down into their individual components using state-of-the-art recycling processes.”

Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. has been working on integrating EV batteries into stationary energy storage since 2010. The company opened a factory for the reuse and refabrication of used lithium-ion batteries from EVs in March 2018. The products are being sold as replacement batteries for EVs and used in stationary power-storage systems, electric forklifts and other applications.

Kelleher says these uses could extend the life of battery cells by five to 30 years before they would need to be dismantled and recycled. Additionally, used and refurbished batteries are helping to improve the viability of other green technologies, such as wind and solar, by bringing the cost of energy storage down.

Further research is going into the design of new batteries to ensure they will not be left by the wayside, literally or figuratively. The Responsible Battery Coalition, which promotes proper battery-lifecycle management, is working with the U.S.-based Argonne National Laboratory and the U.S. Department of Energy’s lithium-ion battery-recycling centre – the ReCell Centre – to develop new technologies that will be more efficient and allow for effective recycling.

Working from the principle that batteries should be designed with their end of life in mind, the Argonne group is developing a recycling method that aims to convert spent batteries into higher-value products.

“Using direct recycling and cathode upcycling could enable us to get twice as much value from a recycled battery as older techniques,” says ReCell director Jeff Spangenberger.

Direct recycling recovers the valuable material in the battery in a form that allows it to be reused more efficiently. Argonne researchers are working in the lab to figure out whether the process can be scaled up for industrial application.

“There are numerous challenges that we’re working through to show that it can be done so industry sees the opportunity and can take it through to commercial practice,” Spangenberger says.

Whether you choose to escape the feeling of being stuck by going on a road trip or simply reading about one, you will likely come away with greater understanding.","Going stir-crazy? Here’s why you feel the need to hit the road You know the feeling. The one where days blur like the view from a train window. The one where you can’t quite grasp what you’re doing. Or the one where you feel profoundly static, in stasis, stuck in a holding pattern, waiting for what, you’re not quite sure, but maybe to do something or go somewhere.

We’ve been walking around the same few blocks, down the same apartment hallways, through the same parks and coming back inside to jump on the same Zoom calls and be surrounded by the same four walls for 14 weeks. Or is it 15? Time is fuzzy now.

Of course, there are worse things to be than stir-crazy. All things considered, feeling antsy in the midst of a global pandemic is a good outcome. It gives a person a lot of time to fantasize about escaping their four walls, especially now that our parks and cities and country are slowly reopening. The summer of 2020 will only happen once.

With the federal government advising that we avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada, visits to relatives being fraught with fear about spreading the virus and cruise ships on lockdown, getting away in the summer of 2020 will likely mean heading out on a road trip, even if it’s only for a day trip or an overnight somewhere. Like Jack Kerouac, the Griswolds and Willie Nelson, we’ll go on the road again, only this time with a trunk full of masks and hand sanitizer.

Cars (rented or owned) can become an extension of your bubble, a mobile physical-distancing pod that enables relatively safe travel.

But even local travel comes with a warning. Follow all local public health guidelines. Maintain physical distances, avoid crowds, use masks when you cannot maintain distance, and practice proper hygiene.

Be smart. Be responsible.

Leaving

The mere fantasy of the open road, or any open space, seems especially appealing under quarantine. “It’s about relative deprivation,” says Steven Taylor, a professor and clinical psychologist at the University of British Columbia. “The things we used to have, the freedoms we might have taken for granted, become oh so sweeter.”

Taylor is a member of the federal government’s COVID-19 expert panel and the author of The Psychology of Pandemics, which was published last year.

Research into previous natural disasters and other traumatic events shows that most people are resilient, Taylor says. Most will cope well. “But we also know from our own research that many people are distressed about being in lockdown. Many people are going stir-crazy — they want to get out,” he adds. This explains, to some extent, the anti-lockdown protests popping up across Canada and images of overcrowded parks.

People who are professionally cooped up for months or sometimes years — astronauts and submariners — as well as people who are more introverted will cope better, Taylor says. People who are more gregarious and extroverted will be itching to get out, to go anywhere. As a result, he expects there will be an increase in local travel as restrictions gradually ease.

“It’s funny,” says Taylor, “A lot of people I know, including my wife and I, are planning [a trip],” he says.

On the road again

Open this photo in gallery Garry Sowerby chronicled many of his driving adventures in his book <em>Driven Mind</em> Handout

“To me, a road trip is [about] getting into getting there, not being there,” says endurance driver Garry Sowerby on the phone from his home in Halifax, N.S.

Name a place, any place, and Sowerby probably has a story about getting there. In his mid-20s, he resigned as a captain from the Canadian Forces, hell-bent on driving around the world faster than anyone had ever done before.

Leaving from Toronto in a Nova Scotia-built 1980 Volvo wagon with his friend Ken Langley navigating, Sowerby drove 43,000 kilometres in 74 days, smashing the previous Guinness World Record. Since then, he’s just kept going, setting three more world records for endurance driving. Sowerby has made a life out of road trips.

“I’m 69 years old,” he says. “Why do I still get excited the night before I leave? I still get that Christmas feeling.”

Shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Sowerby drove through seven Eastern bloc capitals in seven days at the wheel of a GMC Jimmy. Ostensibly, the trip — “Around the Bloc in a Week” — was meant to generate publicity for this new SUV.

They bribed a border guard to get into Romania. “Bucharest was in a state, fires burning in the streets,” Sowerby recalls. The country had just executed its former communist leader, Nicolae Ceausescu. They met a hotel doorman with a thick Texan accent, who, they later discovered, had learned English from watching John Wayne movies. “He was the friendliest guy,” Sowerby says. Bad fuel nearly ruined the engine, but it was a cheap trip. For $3 in Poland you could get a steak big enough to feed three people.

“It’s pointless in a way, but that was 30 years ago, and you and I are talking about it,” he says. “I always thought a good road trip is almost like a piece of art, road art. You create this memory, this experience, that adds to the fabric of who you are.”

A good road trip can be big or small, so long as you make the effort to get into getting there, Sowerby advises. Do so, and you’ll find there’s an infinite number of things to add to the texture of life: like seeing see a two-headed cow, or the world’s biggest Easter egg, or meeting someone new. “It’s about change, I think, change and movement,” he says.

It is the opposite of our current state. No wonder the mere idea of a road trip has a magnetic appeal right now.

Open this photo in gallery Travelling can give us a new perspective on life, says clinical assistant professor Jean Kim. brendan mcaleer/The Globe and Mail

We are missing out on the good things that travel does for us, says Jean Kim, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at George Washington University.

“Any sort of chance to see new things, new experiences, or new destinations and scenery, it’s good for the brain. It keeps it on its toes,” Kim says. Research has shown that travel can make a person more creative and more empathetic, as she detailed in Psychology Today. Without new stimulation and variety, it’s easy for a person to fall into feeling “flat” or stuck in their routine, she explains.

Getting away can also provide some much-needed perspective on day-to-day problems. “When you’re on a trip, you’re in a totally different place, with different people,” Kim explains. “It shifts your perspective.”

It can be good to feel like a small part of a big place, rather than a big part of a small place, like your apartment.

Feeling cooped up herself, Kim went for a drive through the countryside. “Even just doing that was actually helpful; you feel better,” Kim says.

On a road trip, she says, you’re the one determining the course and the destination, whereas in a pandemic, you’re just going along for the ride.

“In a road trip,” she says, “you’re kind of authoring your own story.”

Coming home

From Homer’s Odyssey, to the Book of Exodus in the Bible, to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Grapes of Wrath, journeys have provided a narrative structure for literature since its very beginnings, explains Nick Mount, a professor of Canadian literature at the University of Toronto.

Story continues below advertisement

“Journeys give you a ready-made arc, a ready-made metaphor for discovery, self-discovery, or discovery of the other or of place,” Mount says.

That’s true for real journeys as well as literary ones.

“Part of the pleasure of escaping is the knowledge that you can always return home, and I think that’s a big part of the pleasure of the road novel,” Mount says.

Whether you choose to escape the feeling of being stuck by going on a road trip or simply reading about one, you will likely come away with greater understanding. It could be a deeper understanding of yourself, or the place where you live, or maybe the world and this pandemic.

You won’t know until you return. Whatever it is you come back with, it will feel good to have escaped, to have written your own story and separated the days.

Can’t take a road trip? Book recommendations to simulate hitting the road Two of Miriam Toews’ novels – My Summer of Amazing Luck and The Flying Troutmans – involve road trips. Amazing Luck, her first novel, is about a single mother who leaves Winnipeg in a busted van with her friend to track down the father of her children. Toews, who grew up in Steinbach, Manitoba loves road trips. “[You] get into this Zen rhythm,” she told the Globe when her 2008 novel The Flying Troutmans was published. More driving-inspired books ➜

How to practise good physical distancing while driving this summer The new normal feels pretty abnormal. Streets are empty, parks are off-limits, and supermarkets have become stress centres. After two months, cabin fever is setting in, and your car beckons from the garage. But not so fast. Quite literally, not so fast. There's been a spate of speeding on our roads, with some jaw-dropping tickets handed out. Those empty roads are proving too tempting for some, and it's giving all recreational driving a bad name. It needn't be like this. On paper, a car is pretty much the ideal escape vehicle. It lets you travel around but still maintain a proper distance from everyone. It can be a cocoon of comfort away from a stifling apartment or a meditative chamber while you cruise slowly along a sunny day. It can even be a way to reconnect with your friends. You just have to be smart about it. Keep reading ➜

Gadgets and resources that help you plan your trip Skip a costly GPS navigation system and download free apps, such as Google Maps or Waze, which keep you up to date on real-time traffic congestion and road accidents. Other must-have apps include GasBuddy, which tracks gas prices on your route, and The Weather Network, which can help you stay out of the path of storms. Also, don’t forget about hotel-comparison apps – Trivago, Booking.com or Hotels.com. They’re handy for finding the best deals on accommodations. More cool road trip gadgets ➜
