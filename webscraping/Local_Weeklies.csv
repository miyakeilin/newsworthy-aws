The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on Wednesday, March 11, 2020. (The Canadian Press)

As COVID-19 continues to spread, health officials are urging British Columbians to ensure they take the proper steps to get tested while also not spreading the virus to others.

“Now is the time to put some distance between us to keep our germs to ourselves,” provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said earlier this week, reiterating crucial steps of prevention she has noted since mid-February.

The virus has spread rapidly in B.C. over the past few weeks. There have been at least 46 cases and one death. Globally, there have been more than 118,00 confirmed cases and 4,300 deaths, the majority of them in China, Italy and Iran.

That includes at least four cases of community transmission, which means it remains unclear how those cases were contracted but were not from travelling.

So how do you know if you have the novel coronavirus? How can you tell if it is COVID-19 and not the flu or cold? And most importantly: What do you do if you are, in fact, infected?

Symptoms of COVID-19:

The symptoms of the novel coronavirus are similar to a common cold or flu, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.

That includes a fever and cough but most importantly difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. In severe cases, symptoms can include severe lung infections.

Health officials have warned that it can take up to 14 days, or two weeks, for symptoms to appear and can range from mild to severe. Seniors and those with underlying medical conditions are most at-risk of seeing adverse impacts if they contract the virus.

Out of precaution, health officials have made it clear: if you feel sick, stay home.

""Now is the time to put some distance between us to keep our germs to ourselves,"" Henry says. #COVIDー19 — Ashley Wadhwani (@ashwadhwani) March 7, 2020

The B.C. government has now added an online assesment tool for those who think they may have the disease, and what steps they need to take based off their symptoms.

How the virus spreads:

Coronavirus is transmitted through larger liquid droplets – such as when a person coughs or sneezes. That means the virus can enter a second person’s system through their eyes, nose or throat if in close contact.

While the virus is not known to be airborne, or transmitted through the particles floating in the air, and it is not something that comes in through the skin, it can be spread by touch if a person has used their hands to cover their mouth or nose when they cough.

Health officials recommend to always cough or sneeze into the arm and wash your hands regularly. People should also avoid handshaking and hugs.

A good rule of thumb: Stay at least six feet away from another person.‎

How to get tested:

Anyone who thinks they may have the virus is being urged not to panic, and most importantly to stay home.

Anyone in B.C. who develops symptoms should first call HealthLink BC, by dialing 811, to talk to a health care worker and determine the most appropriate next steps.

The nurses at HealthLink BC will complete an exposure risk assessment of callers with compatible symptoms, such as cough or influenza-like symptoms. In some cases, nurses may suggest a caller go see a health care provider for assessment and testing, either at an urgent primary care centre or walk-in clinic.

Our 811 navigators and nurses are doing an incredible job with record high call volumes – providing support to 3291 callers yesterday. We are adding more staff and more phone lines to resolve the intermittent busy signals some people have experienced. @TeamPAL #COVID19 — Adrian Dix (@adriandix) March 12, 2020

It is highly recommend that anyone who may have COVID-19 call ahead to tell the clinicians that they are coming.

COVID-19 testing is done through a nasopharyngeal swab or throat swab.

Anyone who is tested may be told to self-isolate until the tests can be analyzed in a laboratory. Test results can be found by calling the B.C. Centre for Disease Control coronavirus hotline at 1-833-707-2792.

What happens if you have COVID-19:

Anyone with COVID-19 is being placed in quarantine, at their home or in the hospital, for at least 14 days. In order to be released from quarantine, an infected person must have two consecutive negative tests at least 24 hours apart.

The BC CDC suggests that if you are sharing your home to stay and sleep in a room with good airflow that is away from others. Other precautions include using a separate bathroom, if you can, avoid sharing household items, flush the toilet with the lid down, and clean and disinfect common areas once a day.

Is there a cure?

At this time, there is no vaccine for this particular coronavirus, and health officials say it could take many years to create.

There is no specific treatment, but many of the symptoms can be managed with home treatment such as drinking plenty of fluids, rest and using a humidifier or hot shower to ease a cough or sore throat, according to HealthLink BC.

Most people recover from coronaviruses on their own, however for people with more serious illness, supportive care in or out of hospital may be needed.

With new novel Coronavirus cases emerging all over the world, health officials are urging residents to take precautionary measures to prevent more individuals from getting sick.

Canadian health officials are urging people to wash their hands frequently, with soap, for at least 20 seconds at a time and avoid touching their face or other people.

Handshakes and embraces should also be avoided.

“Wash our hands, stay home when you’re sick, stay home from school, stay home from public events, stay home from visiting people in long term health [facilities] and hospitals,” Health Minister Adrian Dix said at a news conference in early March.

Were you looking forward to a vacation this spring but are now worried about the COVID-19 pandemic?

Canada is under a global travel advisory due to the novel coronavirus. Canadians are being urged to avoid non-essential travel and Transport Canada is warning that repatriation flights are not currently being operated, which could leave those who choose to go abroad stranded.

For hotel stays and airlines outside of Canada, check with your airline, your hotel or your travel agent for their cancellation policies. Some travel insurance is continuing to cover COVID-19 but many providers are not, deeming it a “known circumstance,” which is typically excluded from coverage. Trip cancellation insurance may be an option for those who booked before news of COVID-19 broke.

All air passengers are required to wear masks, although some airlines have removed or relaxed physical distancing requirements on board.

The airline has brought in more flexible options for travellers to cancel or change their flights, and said they’ve increased safety practices, including extra sanitation, on their flights. For more information, visit: https://www.westjet.com/en-ca/travel-info/coronavirus.

Following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s message telling Canadians abroad to come home and for those here to not leave the country, WestJet is suspending international ticket sales as of 11 p.m. PT on Wednesday.

At end of day Sunday, WestJet will suspend all commercial international flights for a 30-day period. After that, CEO Ed Sims said the airline will focus on repatriation and rescue flights.

Sunwing

Sungwing has suspended all southbound flights and vacations between March 17 and July 31, and will be giving affected customers a travel credit. Travel is set to resume as of Aug. 1 and standard change and cancellation policies will apply. For more information, visit: https://www.sunwing.ca/en/promotion/packages/travel-advisory.

As health officials work to sort out the particulars around what specific industries and sectors will need to do in order to re-open safely, British Columbians have been given a high-level road map as to what will relaunch, and when.

Led by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, the multi-phase plan which has been dubbed “the new normal” will rely on whether B.C. sees a required decrease in the number of new daily COVID-19 cases.

As long as British Columbians don’t let up on the basics – frequently washing hands, practising physical distancing, avoiding any non-essential trips, staying home when sick, and taking a careful approach to broadening social circles beyond those currently in their household – there has been much hope voiced by health officials that there could be overnight camping, movie theatres and other social activities returning in coming months.

“We need to have a slow and thoughtful reset, we do not want to undo all that we have done,” Henry said on Thursday (May 7).

ALSO READ: Here’s what is considered an essential service in B.C.

The plan to re-open parts of B.C., curated by Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix, will meet its first test in a few weeks, as the province moves to “Phase Two” with the re-opening of libraries, in-person counselling, restaurants and more.

Henry has made it clear that bans will be reintroduced if she sees a resurgence in cases.

Here’s a timeline of how the province plans to phase in various services.

Phase Two, mid-May:

Re-scheduling elective surgeries and other health services

Dix announced this week that health authorities have already started calling patients who were forced to reschedule an elective surgery due to hospital restrictions and so bed space remained open in case of a spike in COVID-19 cases.

Meanwhile, other medical services such as dentistry, physiotherapy, registered massage therapy and chiropractors will also be able to safely re-open. This includes physical therapy, speech therapy and similar services.

In-person counselling will also be able to resume under physical distancing protocols.

Hair salons and personal services

Welcome news for most: Salons, barber shops and other personal service establishments will be able to accept clients. The decision by health officials comes despite a growing petition signed by some stylists and barbers asking the province not to “single them out” by opening first.

Restaurants, cafes and pubs

In late April, a group of restaurateurs were asked to create a proposed plan on how the industry could re-open safely. Since mid-March, restaurants and pubs of all sizes have been operating only as take-out and delivery services due to concerns of physical distancing.

A possible blueprint, created by the BC Restaurant and Foodservices Association, on how businesses will have to adjust floor plans, seating arrangements and even the handling of cash, is currently before WorkSafeBC, which will be the final green light before dine-in options can return.

Henry has said that ensuring public trust is a second piece in the puzzle. The proposed plan includes a course that business owners and employees will have to undergo, and if passed, get to place a sticker on their front window.

Recreation and community spaces

Phase Two is also set to include the re-opening of museums, art galleries and libraries, as well as recreation spaces.

Parks, beaches and outdoor sites can also open. As with all other sites, physical distancing must be possible, as well as places to properly wash hands. In some cases, this could mean a cap on the number of visitors at any given time.

Health officials have OK’d some non-contact sports, such as soccer and lacrosse.

B.C. Parks has announced some trails will re-open to day use on May 14, with camping reservations to relaunch on May 25 through the Discover Camping online portal.

Office work spaces

Returning to the office will be likely for many British Columbians, but will have to be under measures that reduce the density of employees within certain areas.

Health officials have suggested that employers may stagger shifts, place physical barriers in between desks and space, and ensure hand sanitizer is available for staff.

All employers should have sick-day policies in place so employees don’t attend work when ill, and consider providing work from home options when possible, to reduce contact intensity.

Child care and education

As parents and caregivers prepare to return to work, the province is anticipating an increased need in child care support.

Child care has been considered an essential service, meaning that was not forced to close down like other businesses. Officials have said that in-classroom education will involve its own set of phases – yet to be released – that will allow kids back in the classroom before others.

“With weeks left in the school year, we anticipate many kids will not return to the classroom until September,” the province confirmed.

Phase Three, June to September

If transmission rates of COVID-19 remain low or in decline, Henry has said that further restrictions will be eased under enhanced measures.

While large-scale events, such as parades or mass gatherings will remain off the table through the summer and possibly into next year, the province is hopeful that British Columbians will be able to go to the movies again, starting in July.

Hotels and resorts

The hotel industry has been hard-hit due to a decrease in overall travel both inter-provincially and internationally, forcing many to shutter.

In Victoria and Vancouver, some have entered agreements with the province to serve as temporary housing for hundreds of homeless people currently living in three large encampments.

Exactly what protocols will be put in place in order for hotels and resorts to open safely have not been released, but will likely involve enhanced cleaning and limited guests. The World Health Organization and Henry have suggested that the bacterium does not live on surfaces for longer than hours to days, but specifics have not been confirmed by researchers.

Camping

Overnight camping will be available across B.C.’s parks beginning June 1. Meanwhile, some private campgrounds have remained open through the pandemic.

Film industry

It’s no surprise that Hollywood North has suffered due to border closures and physical distancing measures. Filming across B.C. tends to pick up in the spring and summer, specifically for Hallmark Christmas movies.

Health officials hope that in June or July that domestic productions will be able to resume.

Entertainment

In July, British Columbians may be allowed to head to the movies or attend a symphony, so long as transmission rates stay low.

While large concerts and festivals are off the table, movie theatres and smaller venues will have to follow current bans on gatherings being less than 50 people. Physical distancing also calls for at least two metres between individuals or strangers.

Education

The next school year will still be feeling the impacts of COVID-19, according to B.C.’s plan.

In September, Kindergarten to Grade 12 students will see a “partial return” to school. It’s too soon to say exactly what that will look like.

Post-secondary students could see a mix of online and in-class lectures, with a likely cap on attendance in larger-sized classrooms.

Phase Four, to be determined

It’s unclear when B.C. will enter Phase Four of the provincial plan, because it relies on the development of a widely available vaccine – which has yet to be created – the province reaching herd immunity, or a broad successful treatment that can manage COVID-19 symptoms.

Henry has said that B.C.’s goal is not to reach herd immunity because too many people, particularly seniors, run the risk of seeing adverse impacts of the virus and high numbers of cases would place too much pressure on the health care system.

ALSO READ: Gaining herd immunity through COVID-19 transmissions ‘ineffective’: B.C.’s top doctor

The BC Centre for Disease Control has warned it could take years for a vaccine to be developed, tested and widely implemented.

However, when that does come, B.C. health officials will look to allowing conventions, live audiences at professional sports, concerts, night clubs and casinos and international tourism. Those sectors will also have to create individually tailored plans that meet the necessary health requirements.

According to the B.C. Ministry of Education, school districts are required to post their COVID-19-conscious back-to-school plans online by today, Aug. 26 and Nanaimo Ladysmith Public Schools says it will offer in-class instruction, remote learning and support for home-schooling. In a post on YouTube last Friday, Scott Saywell, school district superintendent and CEO, said high school students won’t be on the semester system.

The ministry previously announced that students would receive instruction in learning groups, or cohorts, with a maximum of 60 students for elementary and 120 for secondary.

RELATED: B.C. gov’t approves 60 school district pandemic plans

In the social media post, Saywell said the semester system wouldn’t allow for secondary students learning groups under 120 students. The school district would prefer flexibility in moving in and out of various provincial COVID-19 stages as the threat grows and shrinks.

Instead, Nanaimo Ladysmith Public Schools, like most other school districts in the province, will be moving to a ‘quarterly’ system that will see students taking two classes at a time over 10 weeks, four times during the school year. There will be one class in the morning and another in the afternoon.

“That’ll run for 10 times a week and then they will shift into the next two classes and of course, that will happen four times over the year, so that students can get their full complement of eight courses,” Saywell said.

RELATED: SD68 navigating back-to-school uncertainty

Because of the way the district is typically set up around elementary and middle school classrooms, which include fewer than 30 students, Saywell said younger students “won’t see much change when they return to school.”

The district recently received $1 million in funding from the ministry to ensure schools across the district are safe, said Saywell, and a majority of that will go towards hiring custodial staff, as well as cleaning supplies and a personal protective equipment for students and teachers.

“We’ve also purchased something called the Clorox Total 360 electrostatic sprayer for each one of our schools and these are hospital-grade machines that can clean our classrooms very quickly and can cover in and around surfaces with disinfectant very quickly,” Saywell said.

RELATED: SD68 students to return to school full-time in ‘learning groups’

The first day of school for students, originally scheduled for Sept. 8, has been pushed back to Sept. 10 and 11, said the superintendent, to allow staff time to become acclimatized to safety procedures.

“They’ll be getting their timetables and learning about all the new health and safety protocols at that time,” Saywell said.

More to come.

Assistance from the public aided in the arrest of a suspect in the Boxwood Road area after he allegedly evaded a road stop and smashed into a police car in another part of town.

Staff Sgt. John Blaise, of Nanaimo RCMP, said the incident occurred on Old Victoria Road at 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, Aug. 26, when police attempted to stop a pickup truck. The driver is alleged to have refused to pull over, Blaise said.

“Eventually they did end up stopping because they went down a dead-end road and the members tried to effect the stop and once the member was in behind the vehicle, [the suspect] tried to run the police car over, reversed and then smashed the police car, and then smashed his way out into a ditch across the street … he was able to get the vehicle unstuck and proceeded to drive dangerously from that point on, all over the place,” said Blaise.

Blaise said the suspect left an oil trail, which police followed.

“We have to give credit to the general public because they started pointing us in the direction that he went,” said Blaise. “Every time we made a corner, there was another person there saying, ‘Yeah, he went this way’ and then ‘He went that way….’ Through the assistance of the general public [we] were able to locate where he had ditched the vehicle and then a foot chase started and he ended up getting taken into custody.”

Blaise said the man resisted arrest and RCMP officers suffered minor injuries.

The man was taken to hospital, as police suspect he may have consumed “illicit substances,” and Blaise also suspects the man may have suffered injuries.

“He was trying to run like Usain Bolt and was nowhere near Olympic shape,” said Blaise.

The suspect will subsequently be transferred to cells at the Nanaimo RCMP detachment.

Drivers won’t be getting the green light anymore at the intersection of Commercial and Bastion streets.

The intersection will become a four-way stop during September and October pilot project, the City of Nanaimo advised in a press release this week.

The traffic signal will remain, but will be switched over to four-way red flash mode as of Sept. 1, and stop signs will be put up at each corner of the intersection.

Jamie Rose, the city’s manager or transportation, said the intersection sees “only moderate traffic volumes” but can see more than 200 pedestrians during afternoon peak hours.

“Under these conditions, research suggests a four-way stop may be more appealing for pedestrians than a traffic signal because each motorist approaching the intersection must stop and look around them,” Rose said. “This change should make walking downtown much more enjoyable.”

The press release noted that the intersection is scheduled for reconstruction in 2021, “and if the pilot is successful, the four-way stop may become permanent.”

According to ICBC data, there were no crashes at that intersection in 2019 and two crashes there in 2018.

Streamkeepers, the neighbourhood association, the city and other partners are working this week to restore a section of the creek at Woodstream Park. A project two years ago to create a side channel for salmon wasn’t wholly successful, and the creek was also damaged by high flows last winter.

So this time of year, with water levels low, was the right time to try to make repairs and realignments. Jean-Michel Hanssens, a member of the Departure Creek Streamkeepers and the Departure Bay Neighbourhood Association, said the creek is one of the only ones left in Nanaimo that can support rearing coho. It’s also home to pink salmon and cutthroat trout.

The side channel, Hanssens explained, allows “the little guys” to get out of the current during the winter.

“The water level comes way up and we get those big rain events and drainage from storm drains that empty into the creek. This becomes a torrent, so the fish get battered up,” he said. “And if they don’t have a place where they can seek refuge, their productivity goes way down because the fish will get knocked down into the ocean.”

The work underway now will raise an area of the creek bed so that the water level will be high enough to back-fill the side channel. The creek bed is also being banked below the channel to try to keep the water moving quickly enough to prevent build-up of a “sand bar” that would obstruct access to the side channel.

“You learn as you go and you realize that well, we’re going to have to make some adjustments,” said Rob Lawrance, the City of Nanaimo’s environmental planner. “They had to find some new funds and the city was available to help with the machine and some of the support work.”

The project needed approval from Fisheries and Oceans Canada, funding was provided by the neighbourhood association and Nanaimo and Area Land Trust, and Snuneymuxw First Nation, Milner Group and others are also helping.

“This kind of work, to be successful, you need those kinds of partnerships. You can’d do these things in isolation,” Lawrance said. “You need First Nations buy-in, you need local community involved. This is a great example of that kind of co-operation in action.”

Hanssens said Streamkeepers have a permit from DFO to trap fish in the spring, and they measure, weigh and release the young coho to track the creek’s productivity. He said rough estimates are that a female coho might deposit 2,500 eggs – 10 per cent will hatch, 10 per cent of those will go to the ocean as smolt and 10 per cent of those will come back as adult fish. Along the way heron, otters and even cutthroat will feed on coho.

“A tremendous amount of stuff goes on in order for one fish to come back,” Hanssens said. “He’s got to survive. It’s a cycle.”

So sustainability efforts of humans who care about the creek and its inhabitants help.

“This is just another small project in the long-term vision to improve the fish habitat along this creek,” said Claudia Boyce, an executive with the neighbourhood association.

She pointed out a few areas where planting has been done to stabilize the banks of the creek, and said there has also been invasive species removal. There’s been a long history of Departure Bay residents caring for the creek, which she called an important feature of the neighbourhood.

“It’s quite a beautiful spot,” Boyce said. “It takes you away from the hustle and bustle and all the traffic … It’s kind of a little, hidden oasis from all the concrete and built environment that we live in.”

Specimens to be tested for COVID-19 are seen in Surrey, B.C., on Thursday, March 26, 2020. Ontario’s overly cautious approach to COVID-19 testing is endangering lives and hindering efforts to rein in soaring infections that are ravaging long-term care facilities, filling ICU beds and lurking silently in communities, say critics alarmed by the province’s admission that labs can handle four times the number of tests they receive. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck

The province is reporting 62 new cases of COVID-19 but no new deaths as of Wednesday (Aug. 26).

The update came in a joint statement issued by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix. Wednesday’s new cases bring the number of total confirmed cases in B.C. to 5,304, of which 896 are active. There have been 203 deaths so far due to COVID-19.

There are currently 21 people in hospital, seven of whom are in ICU.

In their statement, health officials urged British Columbians to show “resiliency and determination” as the province seeks to get through the pandemic. Just hours after the education minister unveiled the latests back-to-school plans, Henry and Dix acknowledged that parents and students may be nervous to return to the classroom in the coming weeks.

”For parents in particular, there is the added challenge of navigating a new approach to in-class learning that includes a number of additional public health protocols and precautions,” health officials said.

“In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is understandable that many people have had increased anxiety and concern for the well-being of their families and themselves.”

The province reported no new health-care or community outbreaks. There are currently 12 outbreaks in health-care settings, 10 in long-term care and two in acute care.

Some school advocates within B.C. are cautiously optimistic following a $2 billion federal government funding announcement for school safety for the coming year.

B.C. will receive $242.36 million as part of the newly created Safe Return to Class fund, an amount in proportion to the provincial population of students, said Dean McGee of the Surrey District Parents Advisory Council, which represents the interest of Surrey parents in the public education system.

“We’re happy to see that it’s split by population, and now we want to see it split by district. We feel (our district) is always left behind.”

In his announcement this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the money can be used for anything from hand sanitizer to remote leaning options. McGee hopes some of the funds can be used for options such as paying for cleaning staff.

He said he’s heard from their district’s superintendent they have already “spent more than $5 million on just cleaners.”

RELATED: Feds roll out $2 billion to fund return-to-school safety amid pandemic

A hybrid model of in-person and remote teaching is also a pressing need, along with larger classrooms with fewer students.

For those students who will attend in-person teaching, he believes more infrastructure such as hand sanitizer and plastic barriers are needed, particularly as many schools within the district use portables.

“There are 8,000 kids in portables – that’s a size of a medium school district in the rest of the province. When those kids go outside, they touch the doorknob to go to the bathroom, hopefully, there’s enough soap or sanitizer there, and then they touch the doorknob to go back in. We want to make sure all of that is up to scratch.”

While the federal funds could go towards more PPE within the classroom, Gord Lau, chair of the Vancouver School District Parent Advisory Council explained it would be better used for developing innovative solutions.

“The instructions from the (Ministry of Education) is that within a classroom, we don’t want kids touching, but you don’t have to practise social distancing. If we have more funding, that’s okay but the messaging (around COVID regulations) is ‘this isn’t required.’ The messaging around ventilation is ‘open a window.’ I don’t think that’s satisfactory.”

Lau added flexibility in the provincial mandate combined with the funding is what is required – particularly for elementary students so that a hybrid solution can be implemented.

“I think that would make parents happier than more funding for PPE.”

For Tracy Humphreys, chair of the CVEdAccess Society which serves students with disabilities and complex learners throughout the province, the funds could help with the flexibility of choice for students and parents alike.

In a recent survey done by the organization, 649 respondents out of 1,102 noted they are considering a different option from public, in-person school.

“I feel the loss of so many students with disabilities is a loss of great diversity and strength in the public education system,” said Humphreys. “The biggest finding we had is that students and parents and caregivers want to stay connected to the community school. Flexibility is key and we feel it is so important.”

In a statement on social media, the BC Teachers’ Federation noted the funds can be used for smaller classes, reduced density, better cleaning and ventilation. They added the province should also provide remote options for students that need them in order to reduce density and support medically complex children and youth.

Black Press Media has reached out to the BCTF for further comment.

Bernard Trest said Wednesday (Aug. 26) that the B.C. Supreme Court claim was filed on behalf of himself and Gary Shuster in Chilliwack that morning – and that the legal action shouldn’t come as a surprise to the leaders of B.C.’s health and education ministries.

“They must’ve known this was going to happen,” Trest told Peace Arch News.

“There’s no way you can introduce a plan this ridiculous and this dangerous and not know that someone is going to file a lawsuit against you and try to stop it.”

Ministry of Education officials on July 29 announced B.C.’s plan for a return to school in September, noting much of the plan will be up to individual school districts.

Under provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry’s guidelines, schools are to open with cohorts of up to 120 at the secondary level and 60 for elementary students. Face masks will be required for students and staff in middle and high school while in high-traffic areas, such as on buses and in hallways, but will be optional for elementary students.

In Surrey, the model put forward includes cohorts Supt. Jordan Tinney has described as “much smaller.”

READ MORE: Surrey high school cohorts to be ‘much smaller,’ Tinney says

According to Trest and Shuster’s notice of application, reopening without stronger risk-mitigation measures – including smaller class sizes, mandatory masking and physical distancing within groups – to protect students and teachers against COVID-19 is “unconscionable,” and they want the court to block the step from proceeding until such measures are in place.

“School boards don’t know how to handle this plan,” Trest said. “There’s really no plan in place.”

Trest – who started a Facebook page with his 10-year-old son Max last month to rally others with similar concerns – told PAN at that time that the science around COVID-19 does not back the return-to-school plan, and puts students at too great a risk.

Wednesday, he said that data released in the past month has only strengthened that position.

“Since we’ve spoken… there’s much more evidence, there’s much more science, and the government, they’re refusing to acknowledge it,” Trest said.

“There’s not a single one individual that’s said this plan is a good idea. Even (Prime Minister) Justin Trudeau… he’s questioning whether he’s going to send his kids to school.”

Six people, including Trest and Shuster, have filed affidavits in support of the court application.

Attorney Kailin Che of Early Sullivan Wright Gizer & McRae cited Trest’s “widely shared” concerns for his son and the community in explaining why her firm took on the case.

“Everyone in BC has an interest in seeing the province safe and healthy,” Che told PAN by email.

“We cannot reopen the economy and schools with insufficient measures in place. We cannot do nothing, and expect things to be okay. The old adage better safe than sorry rings more true during these exceptional times more than ever. It costs very little for the government to take the recommended precautions to keep schools safe.”

She noted that Early Sullivan Wright Gizer & McRae is also representing a B.C. doctor in a case filed a few weeks prior “dealing with similar concerns but on a broader level (not exclusive to schools).”

Wednesday morning, Trudeau announced a $2 billion ‘Safe Return to Class’ fund, “to help keep students and teachers safe as schools reopen.”

READ MORE: Feds roll out $2 billion to fund return-to-school safety amid pandemic

He described it as flexible funding that can be used for anything from hand sanitizer to remote-learning options, but exactly how it may be applied in individual districts – or how much, if any, each district might receive – is unclear.

“What (the provinces) choose to do is up to them… but we know there is more to do,” Trudeau said.

B.C. is to receive $242.36 million.

Health ministry officials were not immediately able to respond to a request for comment; Education Minister Rob Fleming, during a media briefing Wednesday afternoon, said he was “not aware” of the lawsuit.

A further statement from the education ministry notes the province has not yet been served with the lawsuit, “so cannot comment on the specific concerns it raises, and does not comment on matters that are before the courts.”

“We continue to be guided by the health and safety advice of Dr. Bonnie Henry and her public health team,” the statement adds.

Have you thought about asking your insurance advisor?

“A good insurance provider won’t just focus on selling you a policy, they should look at the bigger picture and be a long term help for your business,” says Carly Pagani, a Commercial Account Executive at HUB International Barton in Nanaimo.

HUB offers value-added services that help business owners navigate more than just insurance, including up-to-date resources for problem-solving the pandemic. The Risk Management Services team has become more helpful than ever, with industry-specific advice to help you transition.

Newsletters, webinars and other tools advise you on topics relevant to your field. What should you do with a possible COVID-19 infection in the workplace? How should restaurant owners handle a return to work? Clients can sign up for access to well-researched, thoughtful advice that’s up-to-speed on current conditions.

“We want to educate our clients on what’s happening in the broader world of insurance, and help them be proactive in their business decisions,” Pagani says. “These are difficult times and many entrepreneurs know that going out of business is a dangerous possibility. We’ll do everything we can to help take that stress off.”

Finding insurance in a ‘hard market’

In a hard insurance market profitability is down and investment income is down. The insurance industry was starting to harden in 2018, and the global pandemic hasn’t made things any easier. Insurers aren’t making a profit and underwriters are less willing to take on risk, but your business still needs insurance — so how do you get it?

“HUB is a large organization so we offer you a lot of market clout. Our reach is greater and we have longstanding relationships with underwriters,” Pagani says. “Combine that with our local agents living right here in your neighbourhood and you get the best of both worlds.”

The organization also has a range of experts specialized in different industries who can offer expert advice to brokers and clients.

“We have dedicated teams of brokers specialized in classes like realty, construction, cannabis and others that are really impacted by the hard market. When I’m marketing to underwriters or working with business owners I can reach out to those specialty practice teams for expert advice.”

The B.C. government has approved plans for all 60 school districts to welcome students back in September, with full in-person instruction for elementary and middle schools, and secondary schools where the ministry says the “vast majority” of students will attend every day.

Learning groups of up to 60 students are to stay together in the younger grades, with masks required for hallways, buses and other common areas of schools. Most secondary schools will use a quarter system rather than semesters. There will be four quarters with two courses each in the secondary year, to reduce the size of learning groups, and teachers may go from class to class rather than students.

The individual district plans are to be released Aug. 26, as school principals begin contacting families to share their local plans and confirm attendance. Sept. 8 and 9 are for staff orientation with students attending starting Sept. 10.

Education Minister Rob Fleming said he expects all school administrations to be flexible, and find out from parents if their children will be attending school or if they need a remote option.

Fleming released some details for Surrey, Saanich and Sea to Sky school districts as examples of the adaptations. For Surrey, B.C.’s largest district, classes from grade eight up begin at 8:30 a.m. In grade 10 and up, in-person instruction is offered in the morning with some online classes in the afternoon. In Saanich, middle schools are adopting an elementary school model where home room teachers present most of the curriculum. Sea to Sky, with a smaller student population, is offering full-time classroom for all grades including secondary.

School districts are staggering lunch and recess breaks to reduce student contact outside of learning groups, and high-touch areas of schools are to be cleaned twice a day.

The province has assembled two masks for each student and staff member in the province, but consistent with provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry’s approach, masks are the last resort for infection control. Students don’t need to maintain two-metre physical distance within learning groups, but outside that, distance is the next strategy. Only when distance is not possible are masks to be used.

Fleming said federal funding announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday amounts to $242 million for B.C., to enhance existing efforts with additional ventilation, masks, barriers and additional custodians for cleaning schools and buses.

The parliamentary budget office says a one-time payment to people with disabilities this fall will cost the federal treasury $792 million.

The majority of that amount will go to about 1.67 million people in payments of up to $600, which the Liberals say are aimed at offsetting any extra costs linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The total cost should hit federal books this year, but the budget office warns there may be potential fiscal impacts in subsequent years.

The first legislative push to provide the special payments failed in June when the minority Liberal government couldn’t gain opposition support for a wider spending bill.

A few weeks later, a compromise was struck whereby the Liberals expanded eligibility for the payments to also include veterans.

Payments will max out at $600, drop to $300 for any recipients who receive old age security benefits, and fall to $100 for low-income seniors who receive OAS and the guaranteed income supplement.

The report from the budget watchdog Wednesday notes its estimate on the number of people eligible to receive the payments could be thrown off a bit by a separate part of the federal response to the pandemic.

That is because one of the requirements for payments is to be eligible for the disability tax credit, or having applied for the credit by Sept. 25.

The PBO report says the government’s extension for filing personal income tax returns could reduce the rate at which people recertify for the credit, but calls it a minor source of uncertainty.

The budget office has been independently tracking federal spending through the pandemic to provide its own analysis over the accuracy of government projections.

It updated one of those projections this week in regarding to a special paid leave for federal employees, known as pay code 699.

The policy gives federal workers paid time off for emergencies such as having to quarantine with COVID-19 or to care for children or other dependants, and doesn’t require them to use up vacation or sick days first.

Adding in data from June, the budget office estimates that paid leave has cost the government $828 million since March, inclusive of pension and other benefits. That works out to an average of $3,430 per worker who accessed the leave over that time.

The figures also include estimates for departments that haven’t provided data to the budget office.

The report says the number of hours claimed under the policy is “almost certainly an underestimation of the loss of work hours due to the pandemic.”

Use of the policy has dropped from a peak of 72,700 federal workers in April to just over 43,300 in June, the PBO says. The Canada Revenue Agency continues to have the largest share of workers using the leave.

“The Canada Revenue Agency was able to continue many of its core operations despite claiming by far the most hours of 699 leave. This is due to a strong culture of monitoring time spent on specific activities,” the budget office wrote on its website.

“It is therefore highly likely that other federal organizations not completing core operating functions like meeting legislated timelines for access-to-information requests are severely under-reporting the extent of hours of work lost due to the pandemic.”

Laura strengthened Wednesday into a menacing Category 4 hurricane, raising fears of a 20-foot storm surge that forecasters said would be “unsurvivable” and capable of sinking entire communities. Authorities implored coastal residents of Texas and Louisiana to evacuate and worried that not enough had fled.

The storm grew nearly 70% in power in just 24 hours to a size the National Hurricane Center called “extremely dangerous.” Drawing energy from the warm Gulf of Mexico waters, the system was on track to arrive late Wednesday or early Thursday as the most powerful hurricane to strike the U.S. so far this year.

“It looks like it’s in full beast mode,” said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy. “Which is not what you want to see if you’re in its way.”

One major Louisiana highway already had standing water as Laura’s outer bands moved ashore. Winds began picking up as shoppers rushed into a grocery store in low-lying Delcambre, filling carts with chips and beer. Austin Domingues, 26, said his wife would likely evacuate, but he planned to stay put at his father’s farm, where the house is 14 feet off the ground.

“I don’t know if it’s too smart, but we’re going to stay just in case we need to help people out,” he said.

With time running out, both Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards expressed concerns that not enough coastal residents were taking the dire predictions seriously. In Lake Charles, National Guard members drove school buses around neighbourhoods, offering to pick up families.

Abbott warned that families who do not get out of harm’s way could be cut off from help long after the storm makes landfall overnight.

The National Hurricane Center kept raising its estimate of Laura’s storm surge, from 10 feet just a couple of days ago to twice that size — a height that forecasters said would be especially deadly.

A Category 4 hurricane can cause damage so catastrophic that power outages may last for months in places, and wide areas could be uninhabitable for weeks or months. The threat of such devastation posed a new disaster-relief challenge for a government already straining to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.

By Wednesday afternoon, Laura had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (225 kph) as it churned about 200 miles (320 kilometres) from Lake Charles, Louisiana, moving northwest at 16 mph (26 kph). Forecasters predict winds will reach at least 145 mph winds but may weaken ever so slightly before landfall.

“Heed the advice of your local authorities. If they tell you to go, go! Your life depends on it today,” said Joel Cline, tropical program co-ordinator at the National Weather Service. “It’s a serious day and you need to listen to them.”

On Twitter, President Donald Trump also urged coastal residents to heed local officials. Hurricane warnings were issued from San Luis Pass, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, and reached inland for 200 miles (322 kilometres). Storm surge warnings were in effect from Freeport, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River.

In the largest U.S. evacuation during this pandemic era, more than half a million people were ordered to flee from their homes near the Texas-Louisiana state line, including the Texas cities of Beaumont, Galveston and Port Arthur, and the low-lying Calcasieu and Cameron parishes in southwestern Louisiana, where forecasters said storm surge topped by waves could submerge entire towns.

Edwards lamented that the impending storm meant suspension of community testing for COVID-19 at a crucial time — as elementary and secondary schools in Louisiana are opening and students are returning to college campuses. “We’re basically going to be blind for this week,” Edwards said, referring to the lack of testing.

The storm also forced evacuations from an area of the state where there has been a high rate of positive tests.

A National Weather Service meteorologist in Lake Charles, Louisiana — in the bullseye of Laura’s projected path — took to Facebook Live to deliver an urgent warning for people living south of Interstate 10 in southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas.

“Your life will be in immediate and grave danger beginning this evening if you do not evacuate,” Donald Jones said.

Laura is expected to dump massive rainfall as it moves inland, causing widespread flash flooding in states far from the coast. Flood watches were issued for much of Arkansas, and forecasters said heavy rainfall could arrive by Friday in parts of Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky. Laura is so powerful that it’s expected to become a tropical storm again once it reaches the Atlantic Ocean, potentially menacing the Northeast.

Even before dawn Wednesday, officials in Austin said the city had run out of free hotel rooms to offer evacuees and had begun directing families fleeing the storm to a shelter nearly 200 miles farther north. In Texas’ Hardin County, which has more than 57,000 residents along the coast, officials warned that anyone who tried riding out the storm faced days or weeks without electricity.

Becky Clements, 56, evacuated from Lake Charles after hearing that it could suffer a direct hit, almost exactly 15 years after Hurricane Rita destroyed the city. She and her family found an AirBnb hundreds of miles inland.

“The devastation afterward in our town and that whole corner of the state was just awful,” Clements said. “Whole communities were washed away, never to exist again. … So knowing how devastating the storms are, there was no way we were going to stay for this.”

Clements, a church educator, said she fears for her office, which is in a trailer following recent construction.

“I very much anticipate that my office will be gone when I get back. It will be scattered throughout that field.”

The hurricane also threatens a centre of the U.S. energy industry. The government said 84% of Gulf oil production and an estimated 61% of natural gas production were shut down. Nearly 300 platforms have been evacuated. Consumers are unlikely to see big price hikes however, because the pandemic has decimated demand for fuel.

“If Laura moves further west toward Houston, there will be a much bigger gasoline supply problem,” Oil analyst Andrew Lipow said, since refineries usually take two to three weeks to resume full operations.

Laura closed in on the U.S. after killing nearly two dozen people on the island of Hispaniola, including 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.

The body of an experienced mountaineer who had embarked on a solo trip in Strathcona Park in early July has been found.

Laurence Philippsen, 65, of Black Creek, had left on June 29 for a 40-kilometre trip into the rugged backcountry near Gold River. He had planned to spend three days in the backcountry, and left a detailed trip plan at home. He was expected to return July 2.

Crews initially searched a remote area for four days that included technical terrain around five mountain peaks, each taller than 6,000 feet.

RELATED: Search for missing hiker suspended once again

When new information emerged about where Philippsen was thought to be heading, friends and colleagues from the mountaineering community, search and rescue crews, and RCMP members started the search once again.

But according to a Comox Valley Search & Rescue post on social media, “no clues were produced to lead us to Laurence’s whereabouts amidst this rugged and remote area of Vancouver Island,” and the search was again suspended.

His missing person file remained open with the RCMP and according to friend Lindsay Elms, friends of Philippsen continued to pursue their own adventures in the area, “knowing that Laurence was out there somewhere, and although not a pleasant thought, were hoping they might find him.”

In a social media post on Aug. 20, Elms shares that with Philippsen’s family’s blessing, he is notifying the climbing community that Philippsen was found, about a week earlier on the south side of Mount Laing.

RELATED: UPDATE: Search suspended for missing Vancouver Island hiker

“There is comfort, especially for the family, knowing what happened,” writes Elms.

According to Elms, it appears Philippsen fell and died instantly.

The BC Coroners Service confirmed it was investigating a death from the Strathcona Park area near Mount Laing from earlier this month. The investigation to determine cause of death is in its early stages.

“As mountaineers, we know only too well that there is this side to mountaineering,” writes Elms. “There is passion, but also pain.

“I will remember Laurence for many things, but it was his love of adventure and his willingness to explore new places that brought us together in the mountains.”

Isobel Mackenzie launched the survey Aug. 26, emphasizing the impact of isolation for residents after three months of no visits and strict limits that remain in effect.

“Every day my office hears directly from family members and some residents about how they are struggling,” Mackenzie said, adding the survey is to allow people “to tell us what their life was like before the pandemic hit, what it was like after and what it is like now.”

The 2020 survey is available online at www.carehomevisits.ca and the link will be shared with staff who can help residents complete it, either online or as a printout. Residents or family members can also call 1-877-952-3181 to have a copy mailed to them, or to complete the survey over the phone with a volunteer.

For people requesting the survey in languages other than English, call toll free 1-866-460-8126.

Mackenzie said the isolation of the pandemic has been “heartbreaking” for many of the 40,000 seniors in care homes, some of whom went from receiving daily visits to none at all.

They have been helped by thousands of volunteers who have so far done 140,000 virtual visits, made 25,000 grocery deliveries and delivered 50,000 meals to seniors who have been restricted from going out, she said.

With virus outbreaks at senior care facilities accounting for most of B.C.’s more than 200 deaths, a total ban on visits was in place from March 20 to June 30, when one designated visitor was permitted for each resident.

Fire crews are gaining ground on the Palmer Lake wildfire which is now reported to be 49 percent contained.

Crews continue to battle the blaze discovered Aug. 18, trying to establish a controlled perimeter.

The fire shrank overnight and is now down to 17,735 acres in size and located roughly 15 kilometres south of the Canadian border, according to maps provided by fire officials.

Cold winds over night Monday caused concern for firefighters, threatening to break through the established perimeters. Crews were able to keep the fire contained despite the winds.

Controlled burns are taking place around the outside of the fire to provide a buffer zone free of flammable materials to stem the spread of the fire. Crews are also using aircrafts to drop fire retardant and ignition to further secure the perimeter, according to fire officials.

“Firefighters made significant progress (Sunday),” said the Northwest Incident Management Team 6 in a written statement. “For the next few days, the focus will shift to mop-up and securing a 300 foot radius around structures in the fire area.”

Over 500 personnel continue to work on the fire. Evacuation orders remain in effect for two areas while evacuation alerts are in effect for two other areas near the towns of Oroville and Loomis.

The Town of Osoyoos Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) is continuing to monitor the situation. The EOC is in regular contact with fire officials on both sides of the border to stay on top of the evolving situation.

A virtual public meeting will be held by Washington state fire officials at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, August 25 via the Okanogan County Emergency Management Facebook page to provide an opportunity for questions and short presentation by the incident management team.

The federal government is giving $2 billion in schools safety for the coming school year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday (Aug. 26).

The cash will come as part of a newly created Safe Return to Class fund to “help keep students and teachers safe as schools reopen,” the prime minister said during a press conference at a public school in North York, Ont.

Trudeau also announced a separate $112M for schools in First Nations communities.

Trudeau said the $2 billion was flexible funding and that it was not meant to sidestep provinces, as education falls under their jurisdiction. The money can be used for anything from hand sanitizer to remote learning options, he added.

The prime minister was peppered with questions about why the feds were funding a provincial responsibility, as well as the timing of the money. Students in Quebec have already return to classrooms, while other provinces will have kids in school within the next week or two. Alberta students are scheduled to return Sept. 2 or 3, while B.C. classrooms will fill up with kids by Sept. 10.

“Over the past week or so I’ve heard from… parents across the country that are worried about how that reopening is going to go,” Trudeau said. “What [the provinces] choose to do is up to them… but we know there is more to do.”

Of the $2 billion, B.C. will receive $242.36 million.

The B.C. Teachers’ Federation has called on the province to use the money to reduce class size, density and bring in better cleaning and ventilation, as well as remote learning options for students who need them.

More to come.

B.C.’s coronavirus infection total dipped to 58 cases on Tuesday (Aug. 25), with a single COVID-19 positive test at Langley Memorial Hospital and another at a senior care home in the Fraser Health region.

There are 925 active infection cases in the province, with 2,675 people being monitored after exposure, and 4,114 who have recovered and tested negative. There were no additional deaths, with 22 people in hospital and seven in intensive care, and the remaining patients recovering at home in self-isolation.

Of the 58 new cases, 32 were in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and 23 in Fraser Health. There were two more recorded in Island Health and one in Northern Health, with no new cases in Interior Health.

“Our recent daily cases are higher than many of us are comfortable with, so let’s continue to do our part every moment of the day and keep COVID-19 where it needs to be,” provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a statement.

The new long-term care outbreak is at Bear Creek Villa in Surrey. Fraser Health reports that Langley Memorial Hospital is dealing with a single positive test from a patient who reported symptoms after being discharged.

After coming down to single digits for positive results out of about 4,000 coronavirus tests a day, B.C.’s daily cases have been running at around 90 per day since public health officers identified a steep rise in younger people with exposure at parties and social events in July. As the return of school approaches in September, Henry says this community infection rate is within the limits of health care and contact tracing to contain by identifying people for quarantine.

The province imposed fines of $2,000 for party hosts and $200 for individuals intentionally violating restrictions on public gatherings and guests at vacation properties.

The NHL is showing hockey can happen in a pandemic and the BCHL is anxiously anticipating game action in the fall.

The B.C. Hockey League is releasing team scouting reports to try to build excitement for the 2020-21 campaign and featured the Nanaimo Clippers this week.

The Clippers were the Island Division’s regular-season champions in 2019-20 and Darren Naylor, the team’s coach, said the experiences of last season will help the veterans bring some intangibles this fall.

“The culture of winning is important,” he said in the report. “When you have guys that have been around some success and seen what it takes and have learned from some of the older guys that were in the room, that’s huge. You can’t really teach the culture of winning. You have to be in that environment and see the little things and nuances that it takes to win.”

The Clippers allowed 2.3 goals against per game last season, second-lowest GAA in the league, led by goalie Jordan Naylor who posted the third-best save percentage in league history at .935 and had six shutouts, one off the league record.

“In most leagues he’s stepped into, there’s been a year for an adjustment period and then he figures things out and makes those adjustments,” said Darren Naylor. “He’s always been able to have success thereafter. There were good steps that he took last year and we’re looking for him to make even bigger strides this year.”

The scouting report lists 15 new recruits to watch.

Carter Rose is described as a blue-chip defenceman who was recruited by a lot of BCHL teams after leading his U.S. prep school in scoring last season. Ben Dexheimer is another two-way defence prospect to watch and Michael Palandra, Colton Kitchen and Kabir Gill are experienced junior A defencemen joining the team.

Up front, the Clippers will have a lot of size up the middle as Naylor said he projects all the centremen making the team will be 6-foot-3 or taller. A prospect coming from the States is 6-foot-7 Kyle Van Compernolle, who scouts say is well-suited to the Clippers’ style of play.

Alec Scouras was a high scorer with West Van Academy last season and the Clippers have seen that he plays a 200-foot game. The team is also high on Nick Desantis, who has played at both the USHL and NAHL levels in the States and whose “skill level is through the roof.”

Brody Waters, who played junior B in Ontario last year, is a big, strong goal scorer, the Clippers say, and they project him as a top-nine forward right away. Shaun Mahoney is a prospect who will add scoring and tenacity and other new additions to the forward lines include Kai Daniells, Jaeger Murdock, Elijah Devereaux and Maxwell Dukovac. Tyler Schleppe, a BCHL vet, is a big centreman who the Clippers say fits the mould of what the coaching staff likes.

The Clippers will open training camp Sept. 8 and will play an Island Division exhibition tournament in the fall before the BCHL regular season starts in December.

A sport with a lot of physical contact isn’t going to happen during a time of physical distancing.

The Canadian Junior Football League announced Thursday that it has cancelled the 2020 season and post-season. Nanaimo’s V.I. Raiders play in the CJFL’s B.C. Football Conference.

“It is very disappointing to make this announcement today, but our priority is the health and safety of our players, coaches, staff and team administrators,” said Jim Pankovich, CJFL commissioner, in a release.

The league said current return-to-play guidelines “do not allow for large enough gatherings to make training and competition safe for our athletes.”

BCFC president Tyler McLaren said in a statement released by the league that he feels “for everyone who put so much preparation into this season, and did everything they could to try and strategically make this happen.”

A follow-up statement from the BCFC noted that no decision has been made yet regarding the possibility of extending eligibility for graduating players.

Hockey season is happening and so the Nanaimo Clippers need host families who can help.

The city’s junior A hockey club will be opening training camp on Sept. 8 and are looking for billet families for the 2020-21 B.C. Hockey League season.

Tali Campbell, Clippers general manager, said the team had a few host families “hang up their skates” after last season’s early end, and need to find about a half-dozen beds this month before players begin arriving in the Harbour City the week of Sept. 1-7.

“We haven’t done a very big push yet because we didn’t know what was going on, but now that we know that there’s going to be a season and players will be arriving in September, we’re going to be looking,” he said.

Billet families are asked to provide a bedroom or a suite, while the team covers the player’s grocery bill and provides season tickets for the whole family.

“A billet family is the player’s second home,” Campbell said. “Basically offering a private room and a loving family is all we ask for.”

He said he’s seen and heard about many strong bonds that have formed between players and their host families; he said Tyler Williams’s billet family visited the player in Detroit during an off-season and former star Sheldon Rempal brought his billet family to see him play in the NHL.

“The connection you make is far beyond hockey and that’s what I think is so special about being a billet family,” Campbell said.

Nanaimo Clippers players will finally get to lace up their skates again in early September, though hockey season won’t start until December.

The B.C. Hockey League announced today that it plans to start the 2020-21 regular season Dec. 1. A press release from the league said that its communications with the province and health officials suggested that waiting until December “gives us the best chance at ensuring we have an uninterrupted season, while also maximizing the amount of regular-season games we’ll be able to play,” said Chris Hebb, BCHL commissioner.

Teams are being given the option to start training camp in September, and the Clippers say that’s what they’re doing, with camp set to start Sept. 8. An Island Division exhibition tournament is being planned to start in October and the BCHL news release noted that divisional exhibition games will be live-streamed.

“There’s going to be games played in that time, we’re just not confident we’re going to have a large capacity [for fans],” said Tali Campbell, Clippers general manager.

He said league governors anticipate that by Dec. 1, they’ll be able to fill arenas to at least a 50-per cent capacity.

BCHL teams rely on ticket sales, and will have limited or no gate during the first few months of the season while absorbing costs of running a junior hockey program.

“We’re certainly having to re-juggle our books and figure out ways to make things work in the larger scheme of things,” Campbell said.

But he said “every governor’s on board” with the extended training camp model meant to engage players, help them achieve their hockey and education goals, and prepare them for a 2020-21 season.

“[Players] want to come back to Nanaimo, they want to aim to win a championship here,” Campbell said. “They want to get back into that culture of things and get going on practising and being part of a team.”

LED lights and a new scoreboard are now illuminating play at Serauxmen Stadium.

A $1.1-million lighting project, which also includes a new scoreboard, for the stadium located on Third Street, is one of the first phases of a multi-phase development plan for the facility, according to a city press release issued Monday, July 13.

The new LED field lights are part of a field lighting system that includes eight 24-metre-tall light poles. The system is designed to provide specific lighting levels on the field for optimal playability, which includes up-lighting into the sky so players can keep an eye on balls hit high and deep into the field.

Serauxmen Stadium was built on an old mine site and was officially opened July 31, 1976 with a ceremony that included retired New York Yankees player Mickey Mantle. As part of negotiations between the City of Nanaimo and Nanaimo-Ladysmith school district, the city secured the purchase of the Serauxmen Stadium and Rotary Bowl in 2017.

“Serauxmen Stadium has a deep history in our community as one of the oldest baseball fields in the city,” Nanaimo Mayor Leonard Krog said in the news release. “With the new lights and scoreboard, and as the city’s first lit baseball field, it will ensure that baseball in our community has a bright future, and it is a great addition to the Third Street sports zone.”

The lights will extend baseball season in Nanaimo and give teams more hours of play. This field lighting project is in line with the early improvement plans in partnership with the Serauxmen Stadium Amateur Baseball Association, the release noted. An overall improvement plan for Serauxmen Stadium is currently being developed and will be presented to city council in the near future.

“Having a lit baseball field in Nanaimo has been a goal for the baseball community for many years,” said Lorne Goodall, association president, in the release. “The new lights at Serauxmen Stadium will facilitate much more use by a variety of teams helping the sport of baseball to further grow and flourish in this area.”

The skatepark budget was $779,000.

The Nanaimo Boxing Club has always promoted safe sparring, and that’s taken on a new meaning in COVID-19 times.

The amateur boxing club on Willgress Road remains shut down during the virus pandemic and members have identified the need for a new floor to help with health and safety measures in a reopening scenario.

The boxing club currently has old carpeting, patched and frayed and difficult to keep as clean as people expect nowadays. Club member Trish Harder started a GoFundMe to try to raise $8,000 for three-quarter-inch rubber mats throughout the 2,000-square-foot space.

“I knew that it needed to be done if we are going to open up safely,” she said. “The biggest advantage is our cleanability. With COVID happening, for boxing gyms to open, we need to be able to clean and disinfect everything between classes.”

She said the club doesn’t know for sure if certain types of flooring will be a requirement for reopening, but said she thinks it would make members feel more comfortable.

The club will meet this week to discuss other measures to work toward a September opening; for example, smaller classes are likely, said Barry Creswell, Nanaimo Boxing Club coach. He said he has the right cleaning products and thinks procedures can be put in place to keep athletes safe with “the discipline of cleaning on a regular basis,” which may require more volunteer help.

The club, like most other sports and recreation groups, shut down in March. Creswell said athletes had been training for competition and it was hard to see them miss out on those opportunities, but “we’ve come to accept it.”

He and Harder said boxing, at first, might mean just exercising, fitness and some instruction about techniques, without any mitt work.

“Which is too bad,” Harder said. “I personally kind of miss hitting people.”

Both she and her coach stressed that reopening the club is about more than punching. It might take new floors, now, to ensure a safe space at a place that makes a difference for youths in the community.

“I have boys and girls that come in there that don’t have friends, and then they do make friends and they get a good crowd of family and friends that they see three times a week,” Creswell said. “They count on that and they like that and some of them are really upset.”

Harder said the boxing club is a safe place to go, hang out with peers who share their interest, get out frustration and learn discipline.

“The kids that I’ve seen come in there … they can transform into brilliant, wonderful warriors,” she said.

Spenser Smith, an alumnus of VIU’s creative writing and journalism program who is now studying poetry at the University of British Columbia, has recently launched an online poetry school called Line Break.

“I love poetry and I’ve recently began to love teaching poetry as a teaching assistant at UBC,” Smith said. “Last term I marked and provided feedback on over 150 creative writing assignments and the experience was extremely fulfilling, especially witnessing the growth of students and their writing and knowing I might have played a role in that growth.”

Smith said that experience, along with what he calls the “exploding” popularity of poetry and rise of online courses due to COVID-19 prompted him to start Line Break. In his first course, Write Your Best Poetry, Smith teaches the fundamentals of poetry writing, assigns writing prompts and then provides feedback.

Smith credits his time at VIU for equipping him with the skills needed to teach poetry himself. He said his poetry instructors helped him develop to the point where he could have his work published and throughout the program he edited the poems of his peers both in class and as an editor of VIU’s literary magazine, Portal.

“That really gave me the skills necessary where I could look at a piece of writing and see what could potentially be improved, what’s working well, and that gave me the confidence to be able to teach a poetry course,” Smith said. “I know if I hadn’t taken all of these creative writing courses at VIU and learned from the incredible instructors I learned from I definitely wouldn’t have the confidence nor the skills to pull something like Line Break off.”

Smith said his interest in poetry dates back to his elementary school days, when he got a good reaction from his class for a poem he wrote about candy. Since then poetry has given him an outlet for his political expression and it helped him during his time in active drug addiction.

Smith said poetry my be perceived as being “very complicated and overburdened with theory,” but he said he’ll be focusing on the practical techniques that can be learned at any skill level.

“I know what it’s like to be a new poetry student just starting out so I’ve taken that experience and applied it to what I’m teaching,” he said.

The Vancouver Island Symphony’s Noteworthy Kids children’s choir program will look a little different this year in the face of COVID-19.

Registration is now open for the upcoming fall and winter sessions of Noteworthy Kids, which will take place from Sept. 25 to Dec. 13 and Jan. 8 to April 19, 2021, respectively. The program is open to children age seven to 12 and in adhering to coronavirus safety protocols will be held over the online videoconferencing platform Zoom.

The youths will practise vocal exercises, learn songs of multiple genres and languages, meet members of the VIS and local participants will get to sing with the VIS’s Back Row Brass Quintet at its socially distanced outdoor Christmas concert.

Patricia Plumley is returning as choral conductor. This summer she’s been gaining experience leading virtual Zoom choirs through her Let’s Keep Singing program, which brought together members of seven choirs from the Island and Lower Mainland

“I started out a huge skeptic and now I’m quite a fan of that way it can bring us together and how much we can do,” Plumley said. “Even though it’s different than what we might do, it’s still enormously useful for our choral experiences.”

She said one of the distinct advantages of leading choirs over Zoom is the emphasis on individual voices and how that will help when the singers finally return to in-person performances.

“What was great about it was really that they could hear their own voices and work on their own voice much more easily than you can in a choral setting,” she said. “So I really [think it’s going to] be positive. When we get back together we’re going to be improved individual singers.”

Plumley said some of her Island and Lower Mainland choristers were meeting for the first time. Similarly, the online edition of Noteworthy Kids will be open to youths no matter their physical location.

“I have friends and chorus members over on the mainland who have already said they have grandchildren who they think would be great [for] this,” Plumley said.

She said her experience with online choirs has made it clear that in the face of a global pandemic people still want to find a way to come together to create music.

“Everybody wants to sing,” Plumley said. “Everybody wants to use their voices and the disappointment of not being able to do it chorally doesn’t mean we can’t find a way to connect with each other.”

Not even COVID-19 could mess with the Essence of the Esses.

The alliteratively named art exhibition by Nanaimo’s Skye Skagfeld was supposed to start during the first season starting with S – that being spring – but successfully resurfaced in the second S season of summer during July.

“I had it set up before COVID and then it was shut down,” said the Cedar artist of the originally scheduled show at the St. Joseph’s Art Studios Gallery in Chemainus. “It was here suspended in time and then reopened.”

Thus, the event became Skye Skagfeld’s Soak-Stain Summer Show. There were six dates for viewing in July of her work billed as “a dazzling display of exploration into alternative processes; her latest series of abstract paintings drenched with colour.”

For those who missed it, Essence of the Esses can still be viewed by appointment by contacting Skagfeld by e-mail at skyeskagfeld@hotmail.com.

She’ll also be appearing at the Labyrinth Art Show in Cedar and people can also e-mail for details. Skagfeld will be back at St. Joseph’s where she became one of the first few artist tenants Sept. 23-30 for the equally alliterative event, Euclid Elemental.

The Essence of the Esses not only featured Skagfeld’s work, but her dad’s wood carvings.

“It’s nice to have a bit of 3D with the 2D,” she said. “They kind of complement one another.”

Skagfeld primarily paints acrylic on canvas. When she’s not painting, her profession is teaching English as a second language at Vancouver Island University.

Skagfeld spent about eight years in Singapore among her abundant travels so she’s well-versed in languages. Travel and teaching have both been curtailed since COVID so “now I paint more than I teach,” she laughed. “It’s a good changeover.”

Skagfeld comes by her talents naturally through family members, but didn’t pursue art to any great degree until recent years. Five years after Skagfeld started painting, she also took an introductory class through the Emily Carr University of Art and Design.

With so much uncertainty due to COVID, for the foreseeable future “I think I’m going to keep doing some art, chill out and enjoy the Island,” she said. “I’m happy I’ve done so much travelling.”

Besides Singapore, Skagfeld has been to Paris for a water colour workshop and has travelled to many countries. She went to Toronto last year as the North Island champion of an Art Battle speed competition.

“You have 20 minutes to paint anything you want,” she noted.

As the artists work, patrons move around the easels, closely watching the creative process. The medium is acrylic paint using brushes, palette knives or any non-mechanical implements as tools. At the end of the round, the audience votes for its favourite painting and bids in a silent auction to take the work home.

“It’s super stressful,” Skagfeld pointed out. “It’s equal amounts of fun and stress.”

All the elements of her life taken together are fuel for Skagfeld’s adventurous spirit.

On Aug. 19, Kelsey released From the Woods. The EP’s four tracks were written between 2008 and 2012, when Kelsey was living in cabins in the B.C. Interior with a pair of dogs and making music on her own in her spare time.

The songs have been a regular part of Kelsey’s repertoire and fans have long asked her to make recordings available. Kelsey recorded the EP in her home, which she said added to the “remote, basic nature of the songs.”

“It feels good to finally get them out,” Kelsey said. “The current world situation brought back the isolation I experienced during that time in my life and it wasn’t hard to invoke those feelings again when I was finally able to record the songs.”

The EP was made possible thanks to a $500 Showcase B.C. grant from Creative B.C., the provincial body that supports creative industries. The grant program’s goal is to help B.C. musicians affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and Kelsey said receiving the grant, her first ever, was “an encouraging surprise.”

“Getting the funding from Creative B.C. has not only helped with bills, but it gave me a little bit of space in my mind to create inside the turmoil of everything that’s going on,” she said. “So it’s like, ‘OK, there’s some money in the bank, it’s OK to let yourself work on some music, even though there’s a pandemic going on.’ And it always feels good to focus on something creative and productive during this time, too.”

Kelsey said she feels like music has seemed “a little less important” since COVID-19 struck, especially with the limitations on live performances, but really “this is when we need music the most, either in the creation of it or the comfort of listening to it.” She said revisiting the 10-year-old songs on From the Woods was a healthy experience.

“It’s been a bit cathartic remembering that there can be times in your life when you feel very isolated, when things seem like there’s no hope, and then everything can just turn around in a couple years,” she said. “So I’m hoping that’s what’s going to happen with the current situation as well.”

From the Woods is available here.

Possibly the most well-known Indigenous musician in Canada, Buffy Sainte-Marie, will ‘redline’ a virtual Indigenous music festival in early September.

The 2 Rivers Remix festival has for the past two years been held in Lytton (’Q’emcin is the Indigenous name for the area) but will be going virtual this year due to coronavirus pandemic restrictions impacting all summer festivals in the province. The third edition of the festival, dubbed an ‘online feast of contemporary Indigenous music’, will be streamed at 2riversremix.ca/live/ and other streaming platforms Sept. 4 to 6.

“Buffy Sainte-Marie is a cultural tour-de-force and a tireless social justice activist with multiple JUNO awards and a Polaris Prize as well as being the first Indigenous artist ever to win an Academy Award,” an announcement from the festival team read. Sainte-Marie will deliver an exclusive performance Sept. 6.

“From Universal Soldier, her definitive anti-war anthem, to her 2017 album Medicine Songs, Buffy Sainte-Marie makes us all feel stronger and more capable of seeing the world around us clearly,” organizers stated. “Part rhythmic healing, part trumpeting wakeup call, Medicine Songs is her soundtrack for the resistance.”

Joining Sainte-Marie are a range of award-winning Indigenous musicians including Haisla hip hop duo Snotty Nose Rez Kids, originally from Kitimat. Their second and third albums were on the shortlist for the Polaris Prize – Exclaim! magazine also named their album TRAPLINE one of the top 10 hip hop albums of 2019.

Inuit throat singers PIQSIQ will also be performing at the virtual feast. The Juno-winning sister-duo Inuksuk Mackay and Tiffany Kuliktana Ayalik have their roots in Nunavut’s Kitikmeot and Kivalliq regions and grew up in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. They perform both traditional Inuit songs and new compositions, involving improvised live looping in a sound they call “haunting” and “ethereal.”

Thirty artists will perform over the three day virtual festival, a line-up which is all about reflecting the ‘diversity and strength of Indian country’ organizers stated. Half of the performers are women, one third are youth and one-fifth are two-spirit artists.

“In the summer of COVID-19, Indigenous artists are reverberating and remixing the Interior Nations Chiefs’ 1910 declaration: ‘We will help each other be great and good,’” stated artistic director of the festival Meeka Morgan, who is of Secwepemc, Nuu-chah-nulth and Nlaka’pamux heritage.

Other artists on the line-up include two-spirit songwriter Shawnee, winner of the 2020 CBC Music Searchlight competition, and Juno-winning pop and conscious hip hop artist Kinnie Starr.

The festival also features an Elder series, bringing in artists including blues performer Murray Porter, Willie Thrasher, Linda Saddleback, Gordon Dick Sr. as well as Helene Duguay who was a member of the Quebec girl group the Beatlettes.

For people interested in delving into more of the BC Indigenous music scene during this summer can visit virtualfeast.ca. The platform was launched to both highlight and support Indigenous artists during the pandemic.

For the past five years Moe has been living in Mexico City, a large urban centre she describes as the opposite of a town like Lantzville. When COVID-19 reached Mexico in mid-March she left her apartment and all her belongings and unfinished art projects and came back to her parents’ home.

“I can’t really keep away,” Moe said. “When I’m down there I want to come back to the forest up here.”

Moe said when her family first moved to upper Lantzville in the late ’70s their house was surrounded by nature and her outdoorsman father gave her an “almost religious, spiritual connection” to the forest in the area. She said that connection has since become greater.

“Definitely I appreciate it more,” Moe said. “I think quite often when you mature you learn to appreciate things.”

Almost as soon as Moe moved back to Lantzville she started taking photographs of the trees and flowers in the area and on Aug. 22 she unveils those images in her new exhibition, The Born Again Nature Photographer.

The show takes place at her parents’ property with the photographs suspended from trees in her father’s modest orchard. Victoria musician Soressa Gardner will provide experimental electronic “soundscapes” and social distancing and mask wearing will be observed.

The exhibition features photos taken around Moe’s home, the Lantzville Foothills, along the Arrowsmith CPR trail and Nile Creek in Qualicum Beach. Moe said in her work she tries to create an emotional connection with the nature she’s photographing.

“They’re not conventional images. I play a lot with the beauty of light…” Moe said. “I’ve developed this technique where I’m actually doing them out of focus but just getting the light, the shimmers that are coming off of the plant, off the flower, off the bush.”

WHAT’S ON … Karen Moe presents The Born Again Nature Photographer exhibition at 7421 Clark Cres., Lantzville, on Saturday, Aug. 22 from 3 to 6 p.m.

Reed, born in Nanaimo and raised in Ladysmith, joined the ambulance service in 2007 seeking fulfilment and a way to give back to the community. For the next three years he served as a paramedic primarily based on Vancouver Island, where aside from “the odd medical call” he was most commonly responding to accidents on the Trans-Canada Highway.

“Seeing some of the things involving families and children gave me some pretty bad PTSD that I didn’t address for many years even after stopping working for the ambulance service,” he said.

He spent most of 2010 bedridden, forbidden from even watching exciting movies because he had to keep his heart rate down. It was during this time that Reed reevaluated his life and decided to make some major changes.

“I decided, as much as I loved being a paramedic and as much as it really did fulfil me, the lifestyle was starting to destroy me,” he said. “And so I wanted to heal from the person I had become and I knew that that lifestyle probably wasn’t going to enable me to move forward.”

Reed has since become a registered nurse with Island Health and is married with a one-year-old son. But while he says his life is “probably the happiest it’s ever been,” he still experiences post-traumatic stress. Reed said he turned to writing as a kind of therapy and so far it’s working.

“I had read a lot about how writing about PTSD can be really beneficial for helping you move forward and so that was originally one of the reasons why I wanted to write it is I want to keep healing,” he said. “And I thought if I can get these thoughts out on the paper and out of my head, then they can maybe stay out of my head.”

While Diesel, Blood and Smoke is a fictional story, Reed describes it as “fairly closely mirroring my life.” It follows a young man from Vancouver Island who abandons the “West Coast party lifestyle” to find meaning working as a paramedic, but then finds the high-adrenaline lifestyle is wreaking havoc on his personal life.

Although he initially wrote the book to help himself heal, Reed said he hopes readers will see some of themselves in it and feel motivated to overcome their own struggles.

“One of the goals from wanting to publish this was giving people in dark places a little more hope that there is light,” he said. “I truly believe that the darkness always passes if we just keep reaching for the light.”

Diesel, Blood and Smoke is available online from Amazon and in downtown Nanaimo at Well Read Books.

COVID-19-related changes to the Golf for Life tournament will see the Nanaimo and District Hospital Foundation fundraiser lasting the duration of September.

With safety and social distancing regulations coming about due to COVID-19, organizers had to draw up a new strategy. Rather than a single day of golf at Fairwinds Golf Club, followed by a large dinner gathering, golfers will now tee off for the entire month of September in order to help raise money for equipment for a new intensive care unit planned for Nanaimo Regional General Hospital.

“Everyone will get a chance to enter the month-long event, book a tee time that is convenient for them, and play golf with a chance to win lots of great prizes,” said Ryner Wilson of Fairwinds in a press release.

For every $150 ticket purchase, $50 goes toward the foundation. Tournament prizes will be drawn every week during September.

Janice Perrino, Nanaimo and District Hospital Foundation CEO, said plans for the ICU were moving along until the pandemic was declared. The project cost could rise, she said.

“It definitely put everybody back and allowed both the government and Island Health to re-look at, ‘Are we doing what’s right for this future [ICU]? Is it everything that we need? Will it provide our future?’ and so forth,” said Perrino.

The foundation aims to raise $5 million for the ICU’s medical equipment.

A Vancouver Island University professor will be among those marching to raise awareness – and money for research – for an incurable form of blood cancer.

Multiple myeloma is “a little-known cancer of the plasma cells,” according to a press release. The Multiple Myeloma March is set take place on Sept. 7 and Frank (Fenix) Theuerkorn, a VIU professor in the management department, will be taking part to help others who have been diagnosed.

After suffering severe, debilitating pain in his ribs and a year of testing, Theuerkorn was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2017, stated the press release. The 54-year-old said he had mixed emotions after being diagnosed. On one hand, he felt relief as he finally knew what was ailing him and on the other hand, he was upset.

Following extensive chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant, Theuerkorn learned that that transplant was successful and he was in remission. He resumed teaching that same year, saying he didn’t want to lose connection with his students and that teaching gave him a sense of purpose.

Theuerkorn experienced some health-related anxiety this past February when vacationing on Palawan Island in the Philippines. The government there closed the borders due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Theuerkorn was stranded for three months and worried, as he had not brought enough medication. Fortunately he was able to return home in May.

Theuerkorn has first-hand knowledge of how advancements in myeloma research can have “life-changing impact” on the lives of those living with the form of incurable cancer, and now, more than ever, he and his family are intent on raising awareness, said the press release. He also hopes to help others receive faster diagnoses and provide inspiration for people living with the disease.

This year’s Vancouver Island Multiple Myeloma March, originally scheduled for March, will adhere to COVID-19 safety protocols and will see participants walking in their own neighbourhoods, with registration on Zoom beginning at 9 a.m. on Sept. 7.

Organizers hope to raise $35,000 and a minimum of 50 per cent of money raised will go to Myeloma Canada’s Myeloma Research Priority Setting Partnership, said the press release.

All Girl Guide badges and pins are well-earned, and a Nanaimo Girl Guide will receive one that’s especially coveted.

Alex Brick, 12, was recently selected as one of only four Girl Guides of Canada in her age group to receive the 2020 Change Maker Award.

“The award recognizes girls across all branches as they take actions, small or large, local or international, community-based or far-reaching,” notes the Girl Guides of Canada website.

Brick, going into Grade 7 at École Hammond Bay, helped to create the Human Rights Club at her elementary school when she was only in Grade 4, and has been involved in fundraising, awareness efforts, a clothing drive and more. She’s raised money for the local SPCA branch and for Me to We and has participated in making bag lunches and cards for people experiencing homelessness.

“My friends and I may be kids, but I’ve been helping out long enough to know that even the smallest acts of kindness can make a big difference,” she wrote to Girl Guides of Canada in her nomination.

Roisin Mulligan, Brick’s mother, said the Girl Guides program opens up opportunities for learning, being creative, building social skills, performing community work and more, and is “very girl-empowering.” She said during the COVID-19 pandemic, members of Brick’s Girl Guide group were mailed “giant packages” of guiding materials and kept up weekly Zoom meetings.

Mulligan said she thinks Brick will continue to be motivated to try to make change.

“There’s more great things to come … I’m so proud and excited for her,” Mulligan said. “I know there’s a lot of girls doing the same kind of thing and that’s what I said to her friends: ‘You’re all change makers.’”

The show will go on for Vancouver Island Exhibition this year despite restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A menu will be posted at VIEX’s website (www.viex.ca) and people will be required to stay in their vehicles, to follow social distancing. Fair workers will bring food out to customers, who will be required to pay with debit or credit cards. Information from food truck festival participants will be collected for purposes of contact tracing.

In the meantime, the VIEX Scavenger Hunt is taking place until Friday, Aug. 21. A list of 10 items can be found at www.viex.ca/viex-scavenger-hunt and participants are asked to post pictures of items on Facebook or Twitter, tagging @VIEx, listing the item number and using the #scavengerviex hashtag. Entries will also be accepted online at the previously mentioned link.

Pet owners are asked to submit photos of their animal friends until Thursday, Aug. 20 for the Virtual Pet and Costume Parade.

A virtual dance party takes place Saturday night at 7 p.m., featuring a performance from Vancouver-based Dr. Strangelove.

Michelle Solloway, VIEX director of the main stage, described organizing the 2020 event as “interesting” as organizers had no idea what was happening month to month. It was a “constantly evolving plan,” she said.

“A lot of the challenges were, what do we go ahead and plan without spending money, or doing things that we may have to cancel,” Solloway told the News Bulletin. “The biggest challenges were just probably financial. Figuring out what we can do without paying deposits and then not being able to get those deposits back because we have to cancel because we can’t do that.”

A $10,000 donation is helping Nanaimo’s food bank through summer months marked by uncertainty in a virus pandemic.

Island Savings recently matched $10,000 in fundraising by Nanaimo Loaves and Fishes Community Food Bank toward the charity’s Food 4 Summer campaign.

According to a press release from the financial institution, food banks across B.C. “have been hit particularly hard” by the COVID-19 pandemic, with cancellations of fundraising events and fewer volunteers, but Loaves and Fishes has been able to adapt and build donor relationships.

“The team at Loaves and Fishes are very skilled at exploring new opportunities and improving the efficiency of their operations,” said Alex Brocklebank, branch manager at Island Savings’ Woodgrove location, in the release. “They’re a fun bunch to work with and we’re happy to be able to support the good work they do in the community.”

Abby Sauchuk, director of development at Loaves and Fishes, said in the release that the Food 4 Summer campaign was supported by more than 50 first-time donors.

“Not only did Island Savings support us as a donor, but they also helped us in getting the word out through their social media channels. There’s no doubt this positively impacted the food drive,” she said.

Overall, more than $30,000 was raised during the campaign, in addition to more than 750 kilograms of food.

What would you do if you found a wallet exploding with cash on the street?

For one Good Samaritan in New Westminster, the answer was simple: take it to the local police detachment and hope the rightful owner can be found.

According to police, the “very honest” resident was walking near Eighth and Carnarvon streets recently when he discovered a wallet with $2,290 in cash inside.

“It was a true George Costanza wallet,” said Const. Greg Keall. “It had so much cash and cards inside it didn’t fold shut.”

George Costanza, a notable character in the American television sitcom Seinfeld, was known for carrying a nearly-exploding wallet.

Police said the owner of the wallet was found, who had lost it while heading to the bank to deposit the thousands of dollars in cash.

“Unfortunately in policing we often deal with the negative aspects of human behaviour” stated Deputy Chief Const. Paul Hyland.

“It is always great to get a file like this that reminds us how amazing people can be, especially during a time when so many are negatively affected by the COVID pandemic.”

The local news section of a Calgary Herald newspaper from 1883 began with a one-word paragraph: “Cronk.”

Interspersed between articles were similarly terse and mysterious phrases: “Cronk is good.” “Buy Cronk.” ”Cronk is the drink.”

A Calgary brewery, inspired by the enigmatic ads, has resurrected Cronk. Cold Garden Beverage Co. began selling stubby bottles of the fizzy, herbal-tasting beverage in its tap room Wednesday morning and ran out that night. More should be available online soon.

“I think, overall, it’s a success,” said Trevor Cox, brewer at Cold Garden.

“I think it really tastes nice when it’s cold and carbonated.”

Paul Fairie, a community health researcher at the University of Calgary, makes an occasional pastime of perusing old digitized newspapers and he often posts on Twitter the oddities he comes across.

“Oh God. I’ve got to learn more about this,” Fairie recalled thinking when he encountered the Cronk ads in June.

Cronk went viral. People posted photos of antique bottles that once contained the drink. Someone unearthed a recipe that calls for sassafras, sarsaparilla, hops, chamomile, cinnamon, ginger, green tea and molasses.

The owners of Cold Garden decided to have a go at brewing Cronk.

“The fact that it hadn’t been produced in over 100 years made us kind of interested to see what it would taste like. We couldn’t really find anywhere where anyone had said they had tasted it,” Cox said.

“The only way to find out was to brew it ourselves.”

Getting all the ingredients was tough during the COVID-19 pandemic, but Silk Road Spice Merchant, a shop near the brewery, helped procure what was needed.

The only diversion from the original recipe was leaving out sassafras. That’s because it contains a substance believed to cause cancer and Health Canada has banned it from being used in food.

The brewery used mint, burdock root and other ingredients to mimic the flavour profile of sassafras.

The first attempt at Cronk was a foul-tasting flop.

The problem was the type of molasses.

“The black strap molasses was just way too thick and you could not get any of the other flavours. It was just basically molasses fermented,” said Cox.

“So we used a different type of molasses and the second batch turned out to be exactly what we think it should have tasted like.”

Cox said the concoction has the taste of an herbal liqueur, like Jaegermeister, that’s been diluted to four per cent alcohol content and carbonated.

“It’s meant to be a light beverage.”

Cold Garden brewed up 1,800, 375-millilitre bottles. There was a lineup soon after the brewery opened on Wednesday.

Proceeds are going to the Alex Community Health Centre and to Heritage Calgary.

Some bottles were set aside for Fairie, who was expecting Cronk to taste like “maybe a nice-sipping cough syrup.”

Fairie said Cronk provided a surprising and welcome break from the COVID-19 doldrums.

“I couldn’t have searched for a more bizarre kind of way to spend a month-and-a-half or two months of the pandemic — just finding some weird thing that’s a little bit harmless and a little bit fun to get yourself involved in.”

But, respondents reported that they’re sleeping and “entertaining” (that is, between the sheets) less than before the coronavirus took hold in March.

It may come as no surprise to those of us feeling under-slept lately, but a survey published Tuesday (Aug. 18) by Toronto’s Leva Sleep suggests that COVID-19 and politics are keeping Canadians up at night.

Company founder, Matthew Timmins, said in a phone interview that nearly half of 1,000 surveyed Canadians reported spending more time in bed since the pandemic took hold in March. According to Leva’s study, almost 10 per cent more surveyed Canadian women (54 per cent) than men (46 per cent) said they’ve been logging more bedtime now than before the “before times.”

The survey’s results show that COVID-anxiety accounts for a statistically high proportion of Canadians’ reported sleep deprivation, or just over 20 per cent. Nearly 8 per cent more respondents said that they’re tossing and turning not so much out of fears of the coronavirus itself as fears of an impending second wave of the pandemic.

The study highlighted that a statistically higher proportion of British Columbians reported being regularly kept up at night worrying that the pandemic will get worse before it gets better than those in other provinces. That translates to almost 32.5 per cent of those in B.C., compared with only 23 per cent of Canadians across the prairies and 29 per cent of Canadians in Ontario and Quebec.

Apart from COVID, Leva Sleep found that politics – especially American politics – have Canadians in bed more but sleeping less. Again, British Columbians came in ahead of the national average, with just over 30 per cent of provincial respondents saying politics were stalking their sleep compared to around 29 per cent nationwide. Among politics-addled British Columbians, the poll concluded most, or almost 23 per cent, are worried about politics in the United States, with the remaining 7.5 per cent losing sleep over politics in Canada.

Timmins said his company commissioned the study to see if Canadians were spending more time in bed and, if so, what they were doing on their mattresses. Timmins Leva Sleep’s market researchers compiled the poll’s results from Google surveys by roughly 100 people in each of Canada’s 10 provinces."

A Canadian-born actor is urging everyone to get educated on Indigenous issues and history in 2020.

Dan Levy, co-creator or the popular Schitt’s Creek, posted a video to Twitter about Indigenous Canada, a free online course from the University of Alberta.

“It’s a 12-lesson massive open online course that explores Indigenous histories and contemporary issues from an Indigenous perspective,” Levy said.

The actor said he would be hosting question and answer sessions with professors to delve deeper into the materials and learn about past and present issues that many students – including Levy himself – may not have learned in school.

“Because if 2020 has taught us anything, it’s that we need to actively relearn history – history that wasn’t taught to us in school – to better understand and contextualize our lives and how we can better support and be of service to each other.”

According to the University of Alberta, the course “course explores key issues facing Indigenous peoples today from a historical and critical perspective highlighting national and local Indigenous-settler relations.” For more information, visit: https://www.ualberta.ca/admissions-programs/online-courses/indigenous-canada/index.html.

Levy’s call comes after a series of ongoing Black Lives Matter protests that in Canada have grown to include racism and police brutality against Indigenous peoples.

This year has also seen a fatal police shooting of Indigenous woman Chantel Moore during a wellness check and a confrontation between police and Chief Allan Adam of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation, with police seen on video punching Adam over an alleged expired licence plate.

Re: Artists adding finishing touches to new downtown Nanaimo murals, Aug. 14.

This mural reminds me a lot of a principle that I was taught in care aide school: You can’t judge your abilities based on your easiest client, but only on your hardest: the ones who challenge your kindness and professionalism.

I look at this mural in that same vein. Regardless of whether I agree or disagree with the messages that I see in the mural, it’s not a piece of art that I would personally choose to be part of a city-funded mural program.

As an advocate for free speech, it definitely challenges my perspectives. And anything that challenges my perspectives immediately interests me. I must know why it challenges me, and it’s because some of the concepts that some people might see in the piece are considered immoral. Western society’s moral compass, and thus many of its laws and rulings, have a long, and firmly, rooted history of being based off of Judeo-Christian teachings. But, in reality, the Bible’s teachings are, ethically, not only quite a mixed bag, and thus not ideal to base a society’s morals and laws upon, but, in 2020, they are simply not an accurate representation of the morals of large sections of society, whether they identify as Jewish or Christian or not. And the issue with building a society up from any specific set of morals at all is that though they feel like it, morals are not actually absolute, but, in fact, value-based judgments. And who’s to say that my morals, whether they align with this mural or not, are always correct, or should be the only guide for society, or represented above others as morally neutral/inclusive and thus deemed an ideal candidate for publicly funded art?

I hope the mural stays. Because if one thing is clear, the artist’s intent for the mural is to invoke thought and discussion. Something that is never immoral in any free society.

To the editor,

Re: Artists adding finishing touches to new downtown Nanaimo murals, Aug. 14.

I haven’t yet had the opportunity to see the other murals commissioned by the city but if they bear any similarities to the one shown in the Bulletin I have no wish to do so.

That it is colourful I will grant but other adjectives that come to mind are all somewhat less complimentary. I have to admit to an ongoing disagreement with what so called experts regard as art these days and this colourful but meaningless piece confirms that opinion. Claims that it is thought-provoking are quite correct – the main thoughts arising would naturally be ‘what?’ and ‘why?’

Many years ago Chemainus took the mural route, but unlike Nanaimo, they did it right. With so many subjects available from our city’s rich history surely a meaningful theme could be found to illustrate some of them.

Riding has been another big part of Lisa’s life.

“I’ve been riding since I was about 10, and competing on the Hunter Jumper circuit since about 18,” she says. “I think the riding really gave me the ability to focus under pressure, think fast and react according to changing situations.”

She adds: “I’m definitely competitive, but having said that, I think you have to learn how to lose to really understand the winning part.”

That understanding helped fuel Lisa’s determination as well.

“I get the biggest reward from being a problem-solver and bringing really tough deals together. If there is a solution to be found, I won’t sleep until I figure it out.”

And on her days off?

“Ha! I don’t have many of those!” she laughs. “If the world ever gets to a new normal, I’d love to travel more. Expanding my repertoire in the kitchen would be great too. And growing up, we did a lot of boating as a family, so being out on the water will always be something I love.”

The 7 Sins

Envy:

Whose shoes would you like to walk in?

I have to say that I’m pretty happy walking in mine most of the time (hats off to John Fluevog for great style and amazingly comfortable shoes), but I’d love to have walked in Steve Nash’s shoes during his NBA run. I think Steve is the epitome of hard work and focus equalling success. In a world of brash big talkers, Steve moved faster, thought smarter and delivered with grace and style. What an amazing ambassador for Canada!

Gluttony:

What is the food you could eat over and over again?

I’m addicted to the Prawn Phad Thai from Ba’an Thai Wok & Bar. It’s amazing! Also pretzels—ridiculous—but they have to have just the right amount of salt.

Greed:

You’re given $1 million that you have to spend selfishly. What would you spend it on?

Pre-COVID-19, I wouldn’t hesitate to say world travel and enjoying new culinary experiences. Now, I think it would be having a sunny little getaway place on one of the Gulf Islands to share with family and friends—and a faster boat to come and go!

Wrath:

Pet peeves?

Conceit, laziness and, the worst, entitlement.

Sloth:

Where would you spend a long time doing nothing?

I don’t like to sit still for very long, but I’m quite happy doing nothing on the beach at Sidney Spit, or up in Desolation Sound, provided “nothing” includes some wine, fresh prawns or crab on the portable barbecue, and some good music and friends to share it with!

Pride:

What is the one thing you’re secretly proud of?

On the play side, I’ve been lucky to have been able to compete and win at some top-level Hunter Jumper competitions in New York, DC, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and California. It’s a special partnership with the right horse, and a pretty incredible feeling to win under pressure. With real estate, I’m proud to be the highest-selling agent in Victoria and will be the first to reach the billion-dollar milestone in overall sales this year. I’m grateful to be able to do what I love, and lucky to live in such a special place in the world! Since COVID, I know I definitely appreciate it more than ever.

Lust:

What makes your heart beat faster?

Speed. Winning. Making the deal happen and calling the clients to tell them. Music, dancing, great food and wine, laughing so hard it hurts. And of course, being in love!

“It was different,” Peter Wood says with a smile and a shrug when asked about opening a cafe in the thick of a global pandemic. “In some ways our timing wasn’t the worst. For a long time I was thinking, ‘this is going to be a disaster!’ We were finally at the point when we were ready to open and then a pandemic hits. It was a bit of a kick in the teeth.”

But like any good entrepreneur, Peter quickly pivoted to a pared-down menu focused on takeout and says he’s been pretty “chuffed” by the positive response.

Officially open since early May, Bear and Joey Cafe, where I meet owner Peter to chat life and style, is a beautiful space. It’s like nothing I’ve seen in Victoria before: gleaming in gold, green and pastels, playful and fresh and idly waiting to delight this city.

READ MORE: Growing passion

As we sit inside the cafe on one of the days it’s closed, Peter has to smile and wave his apologies to a steady stream of would-be customers coming up to the door and hoping for a flat white or perhaps Bear and Joey’s incredible granola bowl.

Peter grew up in Sydney, Australia (more specifically, in the northern beaches), where he met his now wife who is originally from Vancouver Island.

“In Sydney, I had two cafes and a pizzeria with a few partners. I studied business and property and worked in residential sales, commercial property management, as well as for a property developer. But I had an awakening, and realized that hospitality is my true passion. I started looking to do a restaurant overseas and when I came to Canada to meet my girlfriend’s parents, I saw Victoria and thought, this is a no-brainer. So we started putting the wheels in motion to move here.”

Now after three years in Victoria, Peter’s vision has become a reality with Bear and Joey. Asked to describe how his approach is different, Peter says, “We’re not trying to reinvent the wheel, but our food program is about light, balanced, healthy and colourful dishes, paying attention to gluten free, vegan and vegetarian. Australian cafe culture is coffee every morning and a simple breakfast grab-and-go, so you can eat off our menu many times a week and feel good about it.”

And what inspired the style of the cafe? “We were always going to go with pastels, perhaps a bit mid-century modern. We wanted something youthful, not formal, something inviting. We really want to delight the few and that was our thought process behind everything.”

Like every business owner, I assume, Peter must wear many hats, and I wonder what specific aspect of his work gets him fired up the most?

“Service,” he says. “Front row centre, service: seeing people delighted, choosing us and walking away happy. I have a thought process about what people will enjoy and then I get all the moving parts together. Like the staff we have now, they are super friendly, enthusiastic, all-round lovely people. Team them up with skilled chefs, and then there’s the room…and when people walk away happy I think, ‘We did it; job done!’ That’s what gives me goosebumps. It’s not an ego thing; it’s being confident in what you’re doing and confident that you can please people, and then delivering an all-round experience. That’s what service front row centre is and it’s a great feeling.”

With no demolition or construction to worry about, the entire dust-free process takes only a day or two.
Beyond cabinets, the process is well-suited to all interior millwork, including bookshelves, doors, windowsills, furniture and more.","When Donna and Larry Schooler’s friends ask how they’ve kept their home’s cabinetry and woodwork looking so good for so long, they’re happy to share their secret: “We had Gleam Guard refinish most of our woodwork several years ago and we’re just loving the work they did. Our friends are always so amazed how good they look. We let them know about Gleam Guard.”

Homeowner Mike Lapolla agrees: “We couldn’t be more pleased with the workmanship and result. Our tired cabinets now look refreshed and ready for another 30 years of service.”

Better yet?

The whole process takes just a day or two, and the preparation? Less time than it takes to enjoy your morning coffee!

“We regularly hear from clients how thrilled they are not only with the result, which really restores their cabinets to the look they love, but how affordable, quick and simple the process is,” says Tracy Booth, owner of Gleam Guard Cabinet Refinishing, serving Nanaimo and the Vancouver Island region.

Here’s a look at the process these families, and thousands others, are happily sharing:

If your cabinets have grown tired over time, perhaps the finish has worn off with years of use, a Gleam Guard trained professional will tint and make them look like new – and that means a “new” kitchen can cost just $2,000 instead of up to $30,000 for all-new cabinets. While cabinets can go slightly lighter or darker, the aim is to restore cabinets to their original appearance, not change their appearance as you would with painting or staining. To ensure that long-lasting finish will offer decades more use, preparation is key, Booth notes. While your prep simply involves clearing off your counters – you don’t even have to empty your cabinets! – your Gleam Guard technician will give the wood surface a vigorous clean, then professionally match and apply the new colour. A wood floor finish is then applied for a long-wearing, easy-clean result, protecting your cabinets from hazards such as water damage, grease and dust. With no demolition or construction to worry about, the entire dust-free process takes only a day or two. Beyond cabinets, the process is well-suited to all interior millwork, including bookshelves, doors, windowsills, furniture and more. And if your cabinets are laminate, they can help those too! “We can clean it and put a fresh finish on it,” Booth says.

As John and Sally McAlear shared, when “Gleam Guard technology brought our dull cabinets back to life, they looked so good we had all of our moulding, doors and frames treated too!”

With 1 in 5 students in the Nanaimo-Ladysmith area affected by poverty, and the cost of school supplies, program fees, clothing and food creating added challenges, the Nanaimo Ladysmith Schools Foundation is there to help.

From a nutritious breakfast to the tools to write that math test to shoes for gym class, many essentials support a school experience that will set a student up for success – today and tomorrow.

But sometimes those essentials are out of reach for local families, and that’s where the Nanaimo Ladysmith Schools Foundation can help.

With roots reaching back to the Nanaimo Awards Society, which first administered School District 68’s scholarship program, the foundation emerged in 2010 to provide a greater range of supports to vulnerable students, explains executive director Crystal Dennison.

One in 5 students in the Nanaimo-Ladysmith area are affected by poverty, and the cost of school supplies, program fees and even clothing and food can create added challenges.

“If we can keep kids in school and graduating, the opportunities for their future are just so much brighter,” Dennison says, crediting connections built with the community, school staff and district. “We couldn’t do what we do for our students without the partnership we have.”

Here’s how the foundation helps local students, with your help:

Student support funding: 1,200 students in Kindergarten through Grade 12 last year received essential school supplies, 9,000 athletic, student and grad fees were paid, and 7,400 basic supplies like clothing and gym shoes were provided. With back to school a crucial time for families and students, the Stock the Lockers campaign welcomes your donations through Aug. 31.

With back to school a crucial time for families and students, the Stock the Lockers campaign welcomes your donations through Aug. 31. Food4Schools: Recognizing that nutrition is an essential building block for learning, last year the foundation helped schools serve 72,000 breakfasts and lunches for 650 families throughout the district. While COVID brought a few changes – families picked up hampers to use for home breakfasts and lunches – the foundation, schools and volunteers continue to adapt based on families’ needs. “The foundation is committed to ensuring students have the breakfasts and lunches they need to learn.”

Awards are distributed according to various criteria, including academic, arts and athletic achievement and student need, and can be used for a full range of post-secondary education, including university, trades and professional programs.

Enhanced learning support: The foundation also supports teachers and schools with small grants for initiatives that fall outside standard funding, such as costs associated with bringing in a particular speaker, launching a robotics program, or re-stocking a library with Indigenous materials.

How you can help the foundation help students

In addition to Stock the Lockers, with donations welcome through Aug. 31, gifts for the food, enhanced learning and award programs are always welcome.

“We welcome new ideas and new resources for local families, and are always happy to work with any donor who would like to set up a scholarship or bursary to support our students,” Dennison says.

Property Dive is a long-term home rental and real estate app that lets you generate the best home matches using a smart matching system.

App technology has transformed the way many of us move through the world. Love a song? Tap the download button to add it to your playlist. Want to meet a potential new partner? Swipe right on their profile.

A Vancouver Island development and technology company is applying that same approach to the search for your new home in Nanaimo.

Beadle Technologies recently released the free Property Dive app, available for both Apple and Android platforms and designed to make searching for your next rental accommodation or home purchases easy and intuitive, explains Jody Epp, VP Operations.

“It’s essentially real estate meets Tinder, connecting you with available properties that match your criteria,” Epp explains.

Customize your home search

Just like you can set your parameters in the popular dating app for who you might like to meet, the long-term home rental and real estate app lets you generate the best home matches using a smart matching system.

Customize your search based on factors such as location, the number of rooms, baths, parking, pet policy, on-site laundry and price, for example. As you explore the listing, you can browse photos, pinpoint the home’s location on the in-app map, and more.

“We all know how frustrating it can be to think you’ve found the ideal home, only to learn you can’t bring your cat, or that the parking won’t work for your vehicles. Now you can pinpoint exactly what’s important to you in your perfect ‘match,’ and quickly and easily see everything that’s available,” Epp says.

Property owners and managers can upload their available properties, while other listings will be included from online sites such as UsedNanaimo.ca and other available resources.

Currently launched in Nanaimo and focusing on rentals for now, Property Dive will expand to other markets and verticals in the coming weeks as users identify both the app’s strengths and where improvements can be made, Epp notes.

In Nanaimo, visit Hub International at 8-1551 Estevan Rd.

Running a business through a global pandemic is no easy feat. Has it been hard to transport supplies through closed borders? Have you had to lay off valuable employees or find creative ways to keep them connected? How have you kept up with health advisory changes and adapted protocols to keep customers and employees safe?

Have you sought advice navigating the COVID19 crisis? Who has been able to help?

Alex Brown says insurance advisors have a wealth of knowledge that goes beyond premiums and deductibles, making them a great support through today’s “hard market” — if you find the right one.

“My father was a small business owner, starting in the basement of our family home and growing to 15-plus employees,” says Brown, a Commercial Account Executive at Hub International’s Courtenay office. “I know my clients are busy, and I’ll do as much of the heavy lifting as possible to manage costs and give my clients some of their time back.”

What is the insurance ‘hard market?’

In a hard market you can expect higher premiums and more picky underwriters — providers are more reluctant to offer insurance and take on risk.

“Costs are rising at a staggering clip,” Brown says. “20 years ago we saw very high premiums and it hurt, but at least you could still get coverage. Now for some classes of business it’s a question whether you can even get it.”

Add the hard insurance market to your other COVID19 concerns and you’re likely wondering what you can do.

“The best things that clients can do right now is be proactive. If you’re just waiting until renewal to look at something it’s probably going to be too late. Clients that are able to show underwriters that they have a plan are going to weather this more effectively,” Brown says.

The Hub advantage

Hub International offers the best of both worlds, with multinational resources and local service agents like Alex Brown.

“As an international company we have strong relationships with carrier providers, and we are leaning on those now more than ever to help our clients navigate this market,” Brown says. “But we’re also local — you’re not calling someone in a far-away city. We meet clients in their board rooms or at their kitchen tables.”

Hub International’s Risk Services Team helps clients manage risk at all times, and is providing extra tools and resources to help business owners with COVID19 reopening. Hub also has industry specific specialty practices to help your business stay ahead, whether you’re in hospitality, transportation, building ownership or another business. Sign up for weekly updates on industry trends, and engage in Hub’s consultative approach.

Zoe does check-in calls for Canadian Mental Health Association in Vernon.

We’ve banged pots and pans during the 7 o’clock cheer, we’ve decorated our windows with hearts and we’ve thanked health workers any chance we get.

But for most of us, when it’s time to empathize with the personal struggles of front line workers risking exposure and added stress, the best we can say is ‘I can’t imagine what you’re going through.’

That’s why the Canadian Mental Health Association and SafeCare BC have launched Care to Speak, a peer support program where front line health workers can talk to someone who understands. A peer familiar with the pressures of the job who has experienced similar struggles.

“Health care workers have been on the front lines since the COVID-19 pandemic began months ago. They continue to bravely and selflessly make the health of British Columbians a priority — sometimes at the expense of their own personal and emotional well-being,” says Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “I’m so pleased about the launch of Care to Speak. I know it will help health care workers, including those in the continuing care sector, to get the mental health supports they need and deserve.”

Support for health care workers

Connect with trained peer support by instant chat or by phone at 1-866-802-7337 (PEER) Monday to Friday, 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. The service is free, and confidential.

Peer Support Workers are people with experience in long-term care, home care and other front line health care roles. The program is not clinical and peer support workers are not counsellors or therapists. Rather than focus on diagnoses, they provide empathy and guidance, and can also provide referrals to other resources like CMHA BC’s BounceBack coaching program, employee and family assistance programs, and the Mobile Response Team.

“Health care workers — particularly those in the continuing care sector — have been working in a challenging and stressful environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s critically important that we support not only their physical safety, but also their psychological safety,” says Jen Lyle, Chief Executive Officer, SafeCare BC. “Having a peer available for health care workers to talk to will be a huge boost to their mental wellness and helps to ensure healthcare workers are in the best position to take care of us.”

“Working under acutely stressful circumstances for prolonged periods of time can significantly impact our mental health, and stigma often prevents people from seeking the help they need. But it can be really beneficial to speak with someone else who has experienced what you are going through and who can empathize with what you are feeling,” says Jonny Morris, Chief Executive Officer, CMHA BC Division.

Care for Caregivers was developed with funding from the Government of BC, as part of its $5 million investment to expand existing mental health programs and services and launch new services to support the mental health of British Columbians during the COVID-19 response and beyond.

BC’s West Coast is known the world over for its colourful patchwork of land- and seascapes, but how often do we experience this wild beauty for ourselves? This summer, rediscover the seaside communities you love and the reasons you love them — places like Gibsons and Telegraph Cove, with their laid-back culture, raw nature, ocean adventures, and wildlife sightings. You may just rediscover yourself along the way.

Whether you travel by floatplane or a ferry, a stunning journey is the icing on a decadent (coastal) cake.

Rugged Coastal Landscapes

No matter how many times you experience it, the dramatic coastal scenery stirs the soul. Capture a collage of moments: misty mornings overlooking rocky shores, dewy strolls through ancient rainforest, and sunset beach strolls, to name a few.

Depending on where you choose to explore, find the tranquility of protected waters or the energy of untamed surf beaches. The remote inlets and plunging fjords of the Sunshine Coast beckon to be explored by kayak, boat, or paddleboard. Tip: take a guided ocean tour to access little-known areas. Or, hop on the ferry to Campbell River on Vancouver Island, where you can head out with an experienced fishing charter and find out why it’s known as “the salmon capital of the world.”

On the mainland, enjoy peek-a-boo views of the ocean as you hike along the Sunshine Coast Trail among towering giants shrouded in lichen. On Vancouver Island, explore the coast along the Juan de Fuca Provincial Park in the south or stroll the eastern shores of Rathtrevor Beach Provincial Park near Parksville.

Laid-back West Coast Culture

Celebrate a world of contrast, from sleepy seaside towns to buzzing cities. With every visit to the coast, you’ll discover a new gem — a funky coffee shop, a new brewery, a colourful art gallery, or a beachy boutique selling locally-made artisan goods.

The burgeoning coastal culinary scene isn’t just reserved for cities like Victoria and Nanaimo. Head on a foodie adventure to the Cowichan Valley or Salt Spring Island to sample farm-fresh ingredients and craft provisions. Or, try Indigenous-inspired cuisine in Port Hardy.

The town where one of Hollywood North’s first blockbusters was filmed now has a permanent red cedar reminder of the industry’s beginnings. And the carving, of Sylvester Stallone’s character John J. Rambo, is officially Sly-approved according to the man himself.

On Instagram, Stallone posted that he was very proud of the “massive” Rambo statue installed in Hope, “exactly where we shot First Blood.” He also gave a shout out to carver Ryan Villiers, who was commissioned to take on the reincarnation of Rambo’s iconic look in red cedar.

Villiers, an Edmonton-based chainsaw carver, has made a name for himself in the industry by taking on lifelike carvings of Don Cherry and Norm from Cheers. It was these carvings that caught the eye of Hope councillor and leader with Communities in Bloom Victor Smith, who commissioned Villiers for this project.

The process began with a lot of Googling of Rambo in different angles – Villiers estimates he had two to three hundred screenshots on his phone. Then it was about scaling, getting the proper proportions which he has modeled on his own frame.

Throughout the creative process, Villiers heard from Sly’s agent after he had seen his progress on the piece. Stallone was shown the photos of the carving when it was still just bare wood, and loved it his agent said in a text message. “So that was icing on the cake for me,” Villiers said.

The only question the agent had, allegedly from Sly himself, was around the stature of the art piece. The carving, Villiers answered, stands 6 foot 1 inch tall.

“First Blood fans have been waiting for this moment for almost 30 years,”said local tourism promoter Bryan McKinney on the day of the unveiling of the piece Aug. 14. Fans of the franchise always wonder when they visit Hope and its many chainsaw carvings, McKinney said, where the Rambo carving is.

And with the piece now installed, McKinney is also able to push back against the digs from his friends in Philadelphia who have their own bronze statue of Rocky Balboa in their city.

“This day is for the fans, the millions of them, that are around the globe and I’m not lying, it’s a little bit of an emotional day for sure,” McKinney reflected on the unveiling. “We often like to say, you know what, the co-star of this film is Hope, B.C. and a lot of the fans they come to our town because of the way the town looked on screen.”

The name of the former Kuo Kong Silk business that occupied the space is seen in tile outside the Chinese Canadian Museum of British Columbia’s first exhibit, “A Seat at the Table” in Chinatown in Vancouver, B.C., Wednesday, Aug. 12, 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck

A giant, intricate dragon mask and a hand-painted wok greet visitors to the first-ever exhibition of the Chinese Canadian Museum of British Columbia in Vancouver’s Chinatown.

The exhibition, called A Seat at the Table, explores historical and contemporary experiences of Chinese Canadians, particularly through the lens of food and restaurants.

“A close look at the food industry reveals the impact of racial discrimination on Chinese Canadians, but it also tells us much about their ability to resist, organize, seek justice and thrive,” reads the museum’s description of the exhibition that opens Saturday.

In one installation, the story of a campaign to save barbecue meat stores in Chinatown in the mid-1970s is told through delicate, miniature paper cut-outs of the storefronts and their supporters, as a spotlight casts their shadows high up on the wall.

Co-curator Viviane Gosselin said the exhibition was two years in the making and involved historians, educators, students, community activists and staff at the Museum of Vancouver, who collected a wide range of personal stories and items of significance from members of the Chinese Canadian community in B.C.

Their goal was to highlight the diversity of Chinese Canadian experiences and create a space where people feel comfortable sharing their own stories, she said.

“All the clusters of images and videos and artifacts are there to act as prompts for people to kind of trigger their memory,” said Gosselin, the director of collections and exhibitions at the Museum of Vancouver, which is partnered with the Chinese Canadian Museum of B.C.

A Seat at the Table includes stations for writing and recording videos, as well as a large map where visitors can illustrate where they have come from, she said.

“The whole idea is to kind of generate a new body of historical knowledge that the Chinese Canadian Museum can use for future research and programming,” said Gosselin.

Grace Wong, the chair of the society that’s working to fully establish the Chinese Canadian Museum, said the exhibition recognizes the contributions of Chinese Canadians across B.C.

“Everything from the 1880s — all the struggles, all the contributions, all of the work, whether it was building the railway, whether it was contributing in the world wars, despite not having any status.”

A Seat at the Table opens amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the Vancouver Police Department has reported that incidents of racism directed at Asian people are on the rise.

Co-curator Denise Fong wore a face mask printed with the phrase “stop the spread of racism” while touring the exhibition this week, saying she hopes the exhibition will spur conversations about how people can make change in their day to day lives.

A Seat at the Table is presented in English as well as traditional and simplified Chinese, Fong noted.

A so-called sister exhibition is set to open at the Museum of Vancouver’s main location in the fall.

Both exhibitions are expected to travel across B.C. within a year, said Gosselin, noting they’re designed to incorporate fresh content each time they open in a new location.

The B.C. government announced an investment of $10 million to establish the Chinese Canadian Museum last month, calling it the first museum of its kind in Canada.

It also gave the City of Vancouver $1 million last year to support the establishment of the museum with satellite locations planned in other communities, as well as an online portal offering interactive experiences at historical locations across the province.

The museum is part of a joint effort by the province and Vancouver to have the city’s Chinatown designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

–– Kamloops This Week

On the lawn of a Westmount home during a sunny Thursday morning sat six-year-old Charlie Manning, waiting patiently next to a table covered in parcels and birthday cards.

One might have thought there were dozens of people waiting to jump out and surprise Charlie, judging from the large number of presents and cards, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Charlie celebrated her sixth birthday at home with grandparents, Ray and Tammy Manning, who are raising her.

Since pre-school, the Westmount elementary student has had a birthday bash on the last days of school in June with her friends, but the pandemic cancelled that this year. Her June party in Kamloops is usually followed by a trip to Idaho in July to visit her aunt Becky and cousins, who reciprocate the visit for Charlie’s birthday in August.

But that, too was cancelled due to the pandemic.

Thanks to the kindness of strangers, however, Charlie was able to have a unique celebration at a time when it looked like she may not be able to have one at all.

Her aunt reached out to some Facebook groups that have people send cards to children and asked people to simply wish her niece a happy birthday.

The response was immense.

Before the Mannings knew it, an avalanche of cards and parcels began arriving at their doorstep from people around the world who had never met Charlie.

In total, 173 cards and about 15 packages were delivered from places like Arizona, Australia, Belgium, Calgary, Comox, California, New York, Mississauga, Ireland and England.

One woman from Montreal even reached out to Sweet Spot Cupcakes in Kamloops and ordered a dozen of the treats to be delivered on Charlie’s birthday — Aug. 13.

Sweet Spot Cupcakes owner Paige Knapp dropped off the treats on Thursday morning, along with a present from her and the staff. She is also making a birthday cake this weekend for the soon-to-be first grader.

Knapp said when she realized what was being done for Charlie, she wanted to contribute.

“I’m glad I was able to make her day a little bit brighter,” Knapp said.

An excited Charlie was quick to bite into one of her dozen cupcakes and she made short work of her gifts — a pile of postage, toys and trinkets littered the grass around her in about an hour.

Confetti-laden cards and anything with unicorns or from Disney’s Frozen brought an elated gasp from the six-year-old.

“I wanted this for days,” she said of one gift.

“Oh, my gosh, look at this,” she said of another.

“I think that’s for you,” she told grandfather Ray.

Ray said it was difficult to explain to his granddaughter why she couldn’t have a party this year and was concerned it would be a sad occasion trying to navigate a birthday amidst COVID-19.

But, he said, the generous outpouring of gifts has had Charlie “bouncing off the walls” and it’s been a humbling experience for himself.

“These people don’t know us from a hole in the ground, but it really gives you a sense that in times like this, there’s still good people out there,” he said. “People do care. I mean, here’s a little girl that is being raised by her grandparents, so we don’t have kids her age in our circle of friends, and they’re making sure she has a birthday she’ll always remember.”

Charlie’s grandmother, Tammy, said she gets teary-eyed thinking of how a random group of people and her daughter stepped up to give Charlie this celebration.

“She’s a very outgoing child, so it’s hard for her and it’s hard when you’re raised by older people,” Tammy said. “This will be a birthday she’ll never forget.”

By Andrew Franklin

Few wildlife experiences compare with seeing a grizzly bear in its natural environment.

So to also witness massive humpbacks, beautiful orcas, soaring eagles and so many more of the West Coast’s storied wildlife in a single journey, well, this really is the trip of a lifetime.

Our adventure begins in the small, picturesque Telegraph Cove, just south of the fishing town of Port McNeill on the east coast of Vancouver Island.

A colourful collection of buildings along a waterfront boardwalk, the community’s humble origins reach back to 1912, when Telegraph Cove was founded as a one-man telegraph station. It later became a fish saltery, sawmill village and today, a tourism destination.

The sheltered waters of the Broughton Archipelago feature an abundance of marine life. Named by George Vancouver in 1792 after then Capt. William Robert Broughton, the Archipelago is a maze of largely uninhabited islands, islets, rocks and reefs that effectively choke off the mouth of mighty Knight Inlet. Two hundred years later it was designated as BC’s largest marine park.

The inlet’s opening lies east of Malcolm Island and Port McNeill, and just north of the opening of the upper end of Johnstone Strait, which separates Vancouver Island from the archipelago between it and the mainland.

Part of the world-famous Great Bear Rainforest, Knight Inlet is one of the longest on the BC coast, stretching 125 kilometres inland and 2.5 km wide.

Boarding the Grizzly Girl

Deciding to take this trip with Tide Rip Grizzly Adventures was easy. From the start, the staff was friendly, enthusiastic and professional – a must if you’re embarking on an off-the-beaten-track adventure. With “staycations” the vacation of choice this season, this out-of-the-ordinary excursion welcomed local tourists from both Vancouver Island and the BC Lower Mainland.

Adding to the excitement, award-winning wildlife photographer Anthony Bucci joined us for the day, sharing his considerable knowledge!

With the safety meeting complete by 7 a.m. sharp, we boarded the Coast Guard-certified vessel Grizzly Girl for the journey along Knight Inlet to the hopeful viewing area at Glendale Cove.

With the trip to the Cove approximately two hours, followed by three to four hours of bear watching, we were looked after throughout the day by Captain James and tour guide/naturalist Laura.

But we didn’t have to wait long to catch our first glimpse of West Coast wildlife. Within the first five minutes an eagle flew overhead, followed by the first of many whale sightings – a massive humpback!

Hugging the coastline, we stopped at a few locations known to Tide Rip staff to catch our first look at grizzlies. The first view was brief – after checking us out, they quickly disappeared into the bush, but it set the scene for adventures to come.

Where wild grizzly bears roam

After spotting a number of black bears trolling the coastline for food, excitement continued to build as we approached our destination for viewing wild grizzly bears: Glendale Cove.

A now-uninhabited area originally the site of a cannery, here the water turns a deep emerald green as glacial waters flow from surrounding mountains.

This is where wild grizzly bears roam and we’ll get to watch them wander their natural environment. At least that’s the hope. Nothing is for certain.

Upon arriving at Glendale Cove, we transfer to a specially designed bear-viewing skiff, featuring raised platforms and unparalleled access to what could be the greatest show on earth.

Our small, flat-bottomed boat glides quietly along the inlet, and Captain James cuts the engine after seeing a mother and two cubs on the beach ahead.

Suited up in thick waterproof overalls, James slips into the waist-deep water to manoeuvre the skiff for perfect viewing, all without disturbing the bears. We’re now quite close and able to appreciate the natural environment and peaceful tranquility in silence. The grizzlies simply ate what seemed to be buckets of blue mussels, scraping them off with their long claws.

A grizzly can be distinguished from a black bear by its noticeable shoulder hump, a more dish-shaped face and its longer claws.

Approximately 80 bears are in the area, including 12 residents and others passing through. Two matriarchs, Lenore and Bella are well known to local guides and we have the privilege of seeing Lenore with her two male cubs. What a treat!

But this unforgettable adventure wasn’t over yet – on the return journey we had even more luck, seeing more humpback whales, orcas, dolphins and Dall’s porpoises were all spotted in their incredible natural habitat.

The final tally for the trip:

Grizzly bears – 6

Black bears – 3

Dall’s porpoises – multiple

Pacific white-sided dolphins – multiple

Northern resident killer whales (orcas) – multiple

Humpback whales – 2

So, if you are thinking of a staycation trip of a lifetime, this is it!

Folks won’t be gathering in large groups for the 30th annual Parkinson SuperWalk, but the event will still be taking place next month.

The annual fundraiser for Parkinson Society British Columbia typically takes place in numerous cities throughout the province, but this year it’ll be happening anywhere participants choose.

The virtual Parkinson SuperWalk is Sept. 12 and 13.

“As we continue to practice physical distancing for the health and safety of our communities, the event will help us carry on providing the programs, support services, educational resources, and advocacy that people with Parkinson’s, their families, and care partners rely on,” the society said in an announcement.

As of Aug. 14, nearly $52,000 had been raised. This year’s fundraising goal is set at $325,000.

People are encouraged to walk in a variety of places, including around their neighbourhood, on community trails, and through parks and forests.

There will also be exercises and fundraising challenges leading up to the opening ceremonies.

“We welcome all participants to send in their own messages of support, and photos or videos from their exercise challenges for a chance to be featured.”

The online opening ceremonies are scheduled to be live streamed at 10 a.m. on Saturday, Sept. 12. The celebration will feature addresses from Parkinson Society British Columbia and members of the Parkinson’s community.

At the ceremonies, they will announce top fundraisers, teams, and communities, and the total amount raised over the summer.

Alla Tanasyuk has found help juggling parenting duties and work responsibilities during the pandemic since stumbling upon virtual babysitting.

The Montreal-based French language teacher, 34, was surfing the internet one day when she came across SOS Sitter, a service that connects groups of six or seven children with a caretaker by Zoom for around an hour. Looking for a way to keep her four-year-old son, Adam, occupied over long days in lockdown, she gave a few lessons a try and quickly becoming hooked.

Tanasyuk now has Adam enrolled in a few hours of virtual care each morning, time she relishes to get her own work done.

“When I’m working, he’s busy too,” Tanasyuk says.

She’s one of many young Canadian parents finding solace in creative solutions to the sudden lack of childcare ushered in by COVID-19. Virtual babysitting is one of the solutions for working parents grappling with the double demands of a day job and parenting duties.

Though Tanasyuk’s son is not yet old enough for kindergarten, she doesn’t plan to send him to daycare any time soon because Quebec’s daily coronavirus infection rate remain higher than she’d like. She’s grateful to know she has other options that work, and plans to use SOS Sitter to keep her son busy for at least part of each workday.

As an only child, it lets Adam can socialize with other children and adults — which has been a strugle for many kids with no siblings during social isolation.

“He likes to listen to others,” Tanasyuk says. “[The lessons offer] a lot of conversation from every kid, and he likes to hear his name. He wants to hear his name, he wants a teacher to call him, ask him if everything is good.”

Everyday, Tanasyuk sits him in front of the computer with materials SOS Sitter childcare providers have instructed her to prep in advance such as books to read, crayons for craft-themed sessions, or comprehension tools for Spanish-language lessons. Adam prefers to take his courses alone, Tanasyuk says, so she lets him enjoy his time independently while she works from another room.

Since pivoting SOS Sitter’s services online at the start of the pandemic, company founder Paulina Podgorska says she’s heard from a number of parents who are grateful to have pockets of free time.

“For 40 minutes at a time, parents can be free of kids and can organize the time to have that important meeting, call the client, talk to the boss … whatever they need,” Podgorska says.

Her company currently offers group sessions at $12 per time-slot, with discounted rates for sessions bought in bulk, but she’s working on orchestrating one-on-one sessions at a slightly higher fee.

Virtual care rates are slightly more affordable than traditional in-person babysitting, which typically hovers at around $15 an hour, primarily because the time and travel are cut from the equation, Podgorska says.

To Tanasyuk, the cost is worth it for parents who have the extra budget.

“I would recommend it,” she says. “It’s an opportunity to continue to learn while being at home.”

Though it’s too soon to say whether school reopenings across the country will affect demand for services like SOS Sitter, Podgorska remains hopeful that parents will continue to rely on virtual babysitting to break up evenings, weekends or days off.

“There are so many situations when [school is not necessarily] closed, but the child is at home today,” Podgorska says. “This service covers the need.”

Elize Shirdel, founder of Toronto-based virtual daycare platform HELM Life holds a similar views. She sees her service, which offers virtual daycare sessions for $9 each, as “a component of a rounded childcare strategy.”

A working parent herself, Shirdel admits she was originally skeptical about increasing screen time for her children. But after realizing that time spent learning via computer has a far different effect on young minds than recreational activities, she eagerly recommends remote learning to other millennial parents.

“When I put my kids in front of YouTube, or Netflix … that gets me back grouchy kids,” Shirdel says. “But when they do an online activity it’s different. They spend a little while drawing and creating and talking and playing, then we get back happy kids.”

Podgorska, too, believes technology can be an advantageous learning tool; she recalls the early days of the pandemic, when SOS Sitter had just launched its online services. She was surprised to learn quickly that Zoom came intuitively to even young children.

“We were so new to this whole thing: I was new to the virtual babysitting, my teachers were new, parents were new, and kids were new,” Podgorska says. “Guess which one took [it] on the best and the quickest? The kids.”

Internet famous Gurdeep Pandher, of the Yukon, has made his way to Long Beach, near Tofino – bringing his stellar bhangra to the beaches of Pacific Rim National Park.

Pandher, who used to work for the government and is now a bhangra dance teacher, became a social media sensation after he posted a Canada Day video of himself dancing in Whitehorse. He moved to the Yukon in 2012, but has been dancing since he was little.

Since going viral, he has partnered with the Canadian Armed Forces and worked with the Paralympic Games.

But this week, he’s on vacation and exploring Vancouver Island.

“I’ve started feeling that may be it’s my duty or responsibility to spread positivity, joy and hope – if we have hope, we have everything,” Pandher told Black Press Media at the time, adding that dancing helps him stay hopeful.

A B.C. woman’s culinary legacy continues to live on digitally and will now help support North Island College (NIC) students.

Ruth “Rootitoot” McCusker of Campbell River was well-known in the online Instant Pot recipe community. She shared her family recipes, which were adapted for the counter-top kitchen appliance, with a loyal online following and had self-published two cookbooks.

McCusker passed away earlier this year after a brief illness. She was 65.

But McCusker’s – also known as Rootitoot, a childhood nickname given to her by her father – legacy is living on.

Her children, Brian Wilkowski and Linda Ramos, have set up an endowment with the NIC Foundation to honour their mother’s memory and to support students who are interested in pursing a career in the culinary arts.

“She was passionate about cooking and so this seemed like a perfect way to honour her memory,” said Wilkowski in a press release. “It’s so fantastic how many lives she’s touched over the last couple of years. Even when she found out that it was going to be a terminal diagnosis, she was grateful for what she had experienced, especially in the last portion of her life.”

McCusker first became active in the online Instant Pot community on Facebook in 2018, according to her obituary in the Vancouver Sun.

She ended up starting her own group, Rootitoot Instant Pot Recipes & Help, which has grown to more than 100,000 members. (Her family continues to run the group.)

“Many were drawn to McCusker’s unmistakable sweetness – she began most posts with the words, ‘Good morning, O Best Beloveds.’ But she was also endlessly helpful, spending the majority of her waking hours fielding queries and developing recipes as needed,” wrote Harrison Mooney in the Sun.

McCusker altered many of her recipes,”treasured family heirlooms” that were developed over four decades to be suitable for the One Pot. She had recipes for Beef Stew and Rootitoot Cinnamon Pork Chops; Rootitoot Cheesecake and Rootitoot Lemon Curd; even Rootitoot Scalloped Potatoes and Rootitoot Sweet Potato Dream. She offered tips and tricks to her “flowers,” the name given to the group’s members.

RELATED: Practice makes perfect for Culinary Team BC

When one of her flowers posted: “Hubby went squirrel hunting n [sic] brought one home. How long in pot whole?” McCusker entertained the question, despite growing up in Banff National Park where squirrels were her “friends and pets.”

“WHOLE?” she responded, “You want to cook it WHOLE? I’d cut that little beggar up into tiny tidbits. Lots of onion and garlic. 1 1/2 cups of squirrel broth. Badger broth if you’re fresh outta squirrel broth. 12 minutes HP. 15 NR. I hear squirrel drumsticks are delish.”

Further down the thread, she follows up with a recipe for “Rootitoot Squirrel Stew” where she refers to preparing the “cute little squirrel” because “I, Rootitoot, am all about the recipes right?”

She was remembered by writer (and One Pot user) Katie Baker in another obituary, this time published on the online sports and popular culture website, The Ringer.

Baker calls McCusker “pure digital sunshine” and her Facebook group, “a place that would become one of the most cherished, cheerful corners of my internet life.”

The group, now at 102,342 members, continues to grow. But McCusker also had a website, where followers could find recipes and order the two volumes of her self-published cookbook. It’s on this site and the Facebook group that her family notified followers that McCusker had died. It’s also where Wilkowski and Ramos began a fundraiser and matched donations. The final tally, $42,862.48 (after being matched by the siblings) will be put into the Ruth “Rootitoot” McCusker Wilkowski Memorial Bursary Endowment Fund and will be put towards a yearly award for an aspiring culinary student.

“We’ll never be able to fully appreciate the entire significance of what we’ve done here,” a message signed “Ruth’s family” on the website says. “This will have a lasting impact on countless lives, just as Ruth’s recipes and help have also had a truly unimaginable lasting effect on all of us.”

As one flower wrote on her website: “I, like many, feel as if I have lost a friend even though I had never met her. She gave us confidence and a place to laugh together over our ‘mistakes.’ Her influence will still be present in generations ahead.”

International Talk Like A Pirate Day. Take Your Pants For A Walk Day. Sidewalk Egg Frying Day. Put A Pillow On Your Fridge Day.

Those are some of hundreds of unofficial (and often weird and comical) holidays celebrated by groups and individuals around the world.

And it’s not just one strange thing to celebrate each day. On any given day of the year, there are several to choose from.

Today (Aug. 8) is International Cat Day. It’s also Happiness Happens Day (to celebrate all things in your life that make you happy), Odie Day (in recognition of the yellow pooch from Garfield), Bowling Day and Garage Sale Day.

And these unofficial holidays are not just forms of entertainment. Sometimes they help raise awareness for things like disorders and diseases.

For example, Aug. 8 is also Top 8 Challenge Day where folks are encouraged to eliminate one or more of the top eight common allergens from their diet for the day: milk, eggs, wheat, fish, peanuts, tree nuts, soy and shellfish. Top 8 Challenge Day came about to show people what it’s like to live with eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders.

There are also weekly and monthly celebrations. In August, folks all over the globe are celebrating Catfish Month and Romance Awareness Month.

Friday was a big day for Surrey youngster Ethan Fritz – after months of separation due to pandemic-related border restrictions, he got to see his daddy.

Well, sort of.

One thing is for certain: the visit – in the form of a U.S. Air Force transport plane over White Rock Pier – caught the attention of waterfront residents and visitors.

Mystery — this grey jet just flew over White Rock's waterfront doing a 360° turn above the pier at about 200 feet. It was grey with no visible markings Presently flying due south into the States.#aviation #whiterock #mystery #CanadaUnitedStates #planespotting pic.twitter.com/KUUXxK9mES — Ken Wuschke (@KenWuschke) August 7, 2020

Acknowledging it likely took at least a few people off-guard – one woman who called Peace Arch News described the unexpected sighting of the “huge” craft as “so close… so scary” – Ethan’s mom Alyssa Fritz said there simply wasn’t time to spread the word in advance.

“I was in-between if it was a good or a bad idea,” she said. “I couldn’t pass it up, my son seeing his dad.

“We all went out of our way to make it happen.”

Four-year-old Ethan has only seen his dad, Lt.-Col. TK Minzak, through video calls since his birthday in early March, Fritz explained, and the separation has been difficult for someone so young to understand.

“When you’re four, it’s really hard,” she said.

“With the way things are and just the job that his dad does… it doesn’t look like we’ll be able to see him anytime soon.”

Minzak, who is originally from Texas, is a pilot for Alaska Airlines and flies reserve for the U.S. Air Force, Fritz continued. Pre-pandemic, she and Ethan routinely travelled to Seattle for family visits.

But that all came to an end in March.

Thursday night, however, Fritz received news that Minzak had organized a special visit for Ethan – permission to do a low-level fly-by of the White Rock Pier in the C17 transport plane he was piloting for a training exercise.

Ethan, his mom and several family members gathered at the end of the pier for the occasion. Minzak was to approach from the direction of Point Roberts and make two passes before returning to U.S. air space.

As the plane appeared in the distance, the excitement built.

“Look, just for you,” Fritz exclaimed to Ethan as the plane came in for its first pass and did a ‘wing wiggle’ greeting. “He’s waving.”

After, Fritz said Ethan couldn’t wait to share the experience with his friends at daycare.

“He was just so happy and excited,” she said.

“It’s not like a deployment,” she noted of Minzak’s absence. “It’s like, his dad is right there and we just can’t get to him.

“Today, it was like a visual – ‘my daddy’s there.’”

A Nanaimo motocross racer was a double champion on the indoor circuit this past season.

Sebastian Sulyok, from Cedar, recently finished first overall in the Canadian Arenacross Futures West 85cc’s age 12-16 division and the open age division.

Seby’s dad Steve Sulyok said the series consisted of eight rounds of “intense racing” with competitors from all over Canada and some from the United States.

The championship-clinching race weekend took place with two days of motos in Chilliwack in February.

“We knew it was meant to be when we woke up to the Nanaimo Clippers team bus parked in front of our hotel window with the huge Nanaimo Clippers logo glowing in front of our eyes. It was truly a special moment,” said Steve.

The morning of the final motos, the Sulyoks had the opportunity to eat breakfast with some of the Clippers players, who gave a motivational pep talk to Sebastian.

The previous day, Seby had finished first in one moto and second in another, but on the last day he swept first place in both motos to end the season the right way.

Steve said the family was proud to bring back the championships to Nanaimo.

“It was a very tough series,” he said. “Once again, the calibre of racing and the amplitude of these arenacross tracks are at the highest of amateur racing. The jumps were absolutely massive and required full commitment on takeoff. No room for error.”

Following arenacross season, Seby travelled to Temecula, Calif. for a training camp with his KTM Canada Spunky’s Factory Elite Race Team, and was able to make it back home amid travel restrictions with the spread of COVID-19.

Sports and fitness gyms and health and wellness centres, like most other businesses, are closed down as a COVID-19 precaution in a time of self-isolation and social distancing. But a lot of people will find a way to keep sweating.

Driven Performance Fitness shut down its Bowen Road location on Thursday, March 19, but classes and consultations are continuing as scheduled through different online platforms, said Karri Perry, a fitness instructor at Driven.

“We’ve been doing live calls with them through Facebook and talking face-to-face about goal setting, seeing what their goals are and then setting them up with a meal plan or a macro plan or whatever they need, based on their goals, to stay on track,” she said.

Some classes are webcast for the students to see and follow along at home, but others have involved every student dialling in for the workout. Perry said multiple instructors can follow along and guide people through the workouts whether they have, for example, dumbbells at home or need to do body-weight exercises.

“We make everyone take a selfie … just as proof, as part of their accountability, they have to take a picture, send it in,” Perry said. “It’s actually hilarious. It’s really fun.”

Abe Avender, owner of Island Optimal Health and Performance, led a conference call with 24 of his health practitioners March 16 and they agreed shutting down was the right move. Avender said halting services such as physiotherapy will slow some clients’ recoveries.

“Pain is one thing, but illnesses that can kill someone is a different animal,” he said.

Avender said Island Optimal, at its Dufferin Crescent gym, posts three daily suggested workouts with different intensities, and said he plans to re-establish that in some form depending how long COVID-19 closures continue.

“We’ll do as much as we can that way to keep people moving and keep you active,” he said.

Modo Yoga classes, he said, have moved online, with 60-, 75- and 90-minute classes guided by qualified instructors, and said the yoga community has embraced the change.

OPINION: COVID-19 doesn’t play by the rules of the game

Prime Sport Performance and Therapy closed its Island Diesel Way facility on Friday, March 20. Clayton Smith, owner of Prime, said staff had come together before then to discuss ideas to help clients keep up with their fitness.

“It’s going to cause us to be creative, but that’s what us as performance coaches have to do anyways. There’s always interruptions, always injuries that we have to work around, so this is just another obstacle and hurdle that we have to be creative to work around,” Smith said.

Prime has put together a program for five weeks, four sessions per week, that people can do at home without any equipment, Smith said. It’s being offered free to members, and he said he’ll share it with any other community members in exchange for a $20 donation to Loaves and Fishes Community Food Bank.

Robert Biernacki, instructor at Island Top Team Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and MMA, also has online instruction videos that he’s sharing with clients and also with partner clubs.

His McCullough Road facility was among the first clubs to close on March 14, and since then, Biernacki has been suggesting applying “social pressure” on other fitness businesses to follow suit.

“There’s no chance anymore of the best-case scenario, but we can definitely avoid the worst-case scenario,” he said.

Biernacki said there are all kinds of fitness possibilities in the interim, from running stairs to signing up for online yoga. Smith suggested going for a run or a bike ride. Perry added that it’s important to try to plan time for workouts and follow through. Avender said people can maintain social distancing while still stressing their bodies “in a cool way” through bodyweight training in their backyard and other exercise.

“Those people that are fully healthy and there’s nothing in a viral sense bugging them, please stay active,” Avender said. “To just hunker down in your basement and not do anything, you’re going to come out of this a lot worse off than you were going into it.”

Vancouver Island University’s women’s volleyball team finished a perfect season with a perfect ending – well, as perfect as it could be amidst a virus pandemic.

The VIU Mariners won the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association championship for a third-straight year, completing an undefeated season with gold medals all around.

The Mariners defeated the Élans de Garneau in Saturday’s final in Quebec, 22-25, 25-19, 25-15, 25-17, in front of an intimate family-members-only crowd. The final two games of the tournament were played in front of a gymnasium mostly emptied due to COVID-19 precautions.

“It truly was an eerie, weird feeling while we were there. The world was turned upside down,” said Shane Hyde, Mariners coach. “Once we got to the gym, it was our couple hours of escaping the real world. That’s kind of the way we viewed it. We took it as a privilege for us to be able to continue playing volleyball.”

The first day of the tourney, other sports were starting to get cancelled, and the team heard word that Mariners basketball teams weren’t going to get to play their national championships. Hyde said the M’s felt terrible for their fellow student-athletes, and couldn’t rest or relax at their hotel room without their phones buzzing about coronavirus and its impacts.

On the second day of competition, CCAA officials met to decide whether to proceed with the tournament. The Mariners, with that in mind, chose to forego a typical game-day practice and play a scrimmage, just in case it was their last volleyball of the season.

However, the matches went on, the M’s won their semifinal that night in an empty gym, and then won the next night’s final in front of a not-quite-so-empty gym as Garneau bent the family-members-only rule a little bit.

“We were getting pushed pretty hard by Garneau, the host team, and we battled and took our game to another level, made a few alterations to our lineup … I couldn’t ask for a better performance from our team,” Hyde said.

He credited Cégep de Garneau for how it handled the changes to the tournament and difficult decisions under tough circumstances. He said since the teams were already in Quebec and couldn’t really leave early, it was the right decision to carry on with the event.

“I guess time will tell to see if it was,” Hyde said. “But everybody did everything they could to keep it as safe as possible.”

Karoline Tormena, who made the championship-winning kill down the left side, finished with 13 kills and 13 digs in the final and was chosen tournament MVP. Jane Nyukhalova had 20 kills, Keira Christensen had 14 digs and Shelby Dorman-Banks had 43 assists.

On Friday, VIU won its national semifinal match, defeating the Fanshawe Falcons 25-17, 19-25, 25-14, 25-22. Danielle Groenendijk had 15 kills, Andrea Cankovic had 14, Tormena had 18 digs and Dorman-Banks dished 41 assists.

The tournament opener saw VIU handle the Lynx d’Edourd Montpetit in straight sets, 25-15, 25-18, 25-18. Tormena and Groenendijk had 10 kills each and Cankovic had four aces.

Amanda Dobbyn, Dorman-Banks and Cankovic were selected as first-team all-stars.

The three CCAA titles in a row make it four in five years for the VIU Mariners dynasty, but national championships are never a foregone conclusion. Even in a perfect 29-0 season there was adversity – ferry cancellations, snow cancellations, a bus breakdown, and then novel coronavirus.

“[I’m] super proud of these girls. What they’ve went through in terms of real world problems that they’re dealing with as a group and then playing through it and playing through this whole year, this stuff doesn’t just happen,” Hyde said. “We’ve been making it look easy, but it’s not easy by any means.”

The national championship basketball tournament that Vancouver Island University had been looking forward to all season has been cancelled.

The Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association released a statement this afternoon advising that it is cancelling the women’s and men’s basketball championships “due to the ongoing developments in the COVID-19 pandemic.”

The CCAA added that “the safety of our student athletes is our priority.”

Women’s basketball nationals were supposed to happen March 18-21 in the VIU gym. The VIU Mariners women won the PacWest championship earlier this month.

“It was predictable and understood, but at the same time, it was almost like a shock and awe kind of thing that it was all over,” said Tony Bryce, the team’s coach.

The VIU Mariners men’s basketball team had won provincial silver medals and had been slated to travel to nationals at Humber College in Ontario next week.

The CCAA is carrying on with volleyball nationals, which are happening now. The VIU Mariners women’s volleyball team advanced earlier today, March 12, to the national semifinals at Cégep Garneau in Quebec.

The Nanaimo Clippers beat Alberni Valley Bulldogs 2-1 Thursday night in Port Alberni to sweep the B.C. Hockey League Island Division semifinals in four straight games.

“(The Bulldogs) played us really hard today,” Clippers’ head coach Darren Naylor said. “The second period, they were all over us. Our goalie (Jordan Naylor) held us in the second period and we were lucky enough to get that late one; I think that one stung the Bulldogs a little bit.”

After a scoreless first period, the Bulldogs opened scoring at 6:01 of the second, Mattias Dal Monte putting a pass from Tommy Bannister away. The Clippers’ Ethan Scardina pulled Nanaimo even with 33 seconds left in the second.

Scardina also collected an assist on Tim Washe’s second of the season, scored at the four-minute mark of the third period to give Nanaimo the lead and the eventual Game 4 sweep.

Jordan Naylor stopped 34 of 25 shots for the Clippers, while Luke Pearson stopped 36 of 38 in net for the Bulldogs.

“It’s always tough when it’s over,” a subdued Bulldogs’ head coach Joe Martin said following the game. This was Martin’s first year in Port Alberni after winning coach of the year in 2019 with the Merritt Centennials.

“We were feeling like in the last two games we were just getting back to who we were; we lost it for a long time for numerous reasons. We got our groove back, got our players healthy just before playoffs.”

“We’re a pretty stingy team,” Darren Naylor said, adding that the Clippers haven’t given up a lot of goals all year. He complimented the Bulldogs after the game. “This is a good hockey team; maybe a little bit young,” he said, adding that they remind him of where Nanaimo was last season.

“They have nothing to hang their heads about. They battled us pretty hard.”

Consistency is what gave Nanaimo the edge in this series, he added – that and the flexibility to play wide-open games such as the first two in the series, as well as tighter games behind the blueline like they had to in Port Alberni.

“People are realizing that we’re pretty deep, and we’re a pretty solid team. We’ve been pretty consistent all year,” he said. “We don’t really have one superstar kind of a guy. We’re four lines, six D and two goalies, and that’s how we play it.”

Winning the Island Division regular season title gives the Clippers home ice advantage in the division finals. Nanaimo has won nine games in a row now, and has only lost a handful of games at home.

GAME ON … The Clippers will play the winner of Cowichan Valley Capitals versus Powell River Kings series. The Caps have a chance to win their series at home on Friday, March 6, in Game 5.

But Nanaimo’s Aiden Hansen-Bukata scored at 11:22 to make it 3-1. Although Dawson Tritt was able to notch one more goal for the home team before the end of the game, the comeback fell just short for the Bulldogs. Nanaimo took Game 3 with a 3-2 score.

The Campbell River Storm are one win away from advancing to the next round of the VIJHL playoffs.

The Storm peppered the Nanaimo Buccaneers net with shots on their way to a 5-4 victory at the Rod Brind’Amour Arena Tuesday night.

Bucs goalie Austin Dendl, who’s been solid in net for his team all series, faced a series-high 61 shots from the home team.

For the Bucs offence, it was quality over quantity in the shots department. They shot on the Storm net just 24 times but needed fewer than five chances to score in the first period, with affiliate player James Joyce netting the opening goal at 1:57 of the frame.

The Storm returned from the first break with focus. They scored three unanswered goals in less than three minutes and added one more before Nanaimo was able to respond.

The first goal came from Noah Fladager at 6:28 of the period, who capitalized on a juicy rebound as Jory Swanson and Isaac Tonkin-Palmer picked up assists. Then, just over 1.5 minutes later, Tonkin-Palmer scored a goal of his own on a Storm power play with Swanson and Owen Christensen getting credited with assists.

Tonkin-Palmer then added one more point to his tally at 8:47 of the period with Storm captain Kyle Jennings picking up the assist.

With less than five minutes to go in the period, Cody Savey gave the Storm a 4-1 lead with an unassisted goal. But Nanaimo would not back down. With Tonkin-Palmer in the box for slashing, the Bucs stormed the Campbell River net. Goalie Aaron de Kok got tangled with up with his own team and the Bucs scored, which had fans screaming for a no-goal.

The goal would stand and Nanaimo would continue to erase their deficit as Jaxon Krupa scored his second of the night with less than two minutes to go in the frame to bring his team within one point.

At 7:14 of the third period, Nanaimo tied things up as Luke Golka scored with the assist going to Connor Casparie.

In the first four games of the series, the Storm earned all their wins in regulation time. When the games went to overtime, Nanaimo proved victorious.

So with everything equal at 4-4 and just over 10 minutes to go in regulation, the Storm were chasing a goal.

They would find one with less than two minutes to go in regulation time. Jackson Dyke, from Ryan Suzukovich and Josh Pederson, scored his first playoff goal of the season to lift the Storm to a 5-4 game 5 victory and a 3-2 series lead over the Nanaimo Buccaneers.

The Nanaimo Clippers doubled up the opposition for a second-straight night to take a two-games-to-none lead in their first-round playoff series.

The Clippers handled the Alberni Valley Bulldogs 6-3 on Saturday night at Frank Crane Arena in a déjà-vu Game 2, one night after winning 6-3 at Frank Crane in Game 1.

“It was a good game,” said Darren Naylor, Clippers coach. “They worked hard, they buried some chances on us, there were a couple lucky goals.”

The Bulldogs led the game by scores of 2-1 and 3-2, but the Clippers possessed the puck most of the second half of the game and won with ease.

“I think we were pretty resilient,” said Devon Mussio, Clippers defenceman. “There was times when we went down, but we ended up coming back and it shows our character in our room right now.”

Mussio and Josh Kagan had two goals each, Josh Bourne had a goal and four assists and Trevor LeDonne was Nanaimo’s other scorer. Jordan Naylor made 30 saves for the win.

For Alberni Valley, Olivier Fizet, Ryan Doolin and Matthew Grouchy scored and Jackson Glassford made 38 stops.

The Clippers coach said winning the first two games of the series is “a start.”

“You’ve got to win your home games, and it doesn’t become a series till you win one on the road, so we’ve got to go in there and we want to win that first one,” Darren Naylor said.

Mussio said the Clippers feel like they can go out and play their game whether it’s at home or on the road, and the series lead helps.

“We’re definitely confident right now,” he said. “We can’t let up. We’ve got to go into their barn and win the next one.”

In Game 1, Ethan Scardina and Bourne each had two goals and an assist for the Clippers and Steven Agriogianis and Tim Washe were other scorers. Jordan Naylor made 25 saves for the win. For the Bulldogs, Jacob Bosse scored twice and Isaac Pascoal also tallied. Glassford made 23 saves.

GAME ON … The Clippers and Bulldogs play the next two games of the series at Port Alberni’s Weyerhaeuser Arena on Tuesday, March 3, and Thursday, March 5. Game 5, if necessary, will be back at Nanaimo’s Frank Crane Arena on Friday, March 6, at 7 p.m.

This time, the Campbell River Storm were able to score more than enough goals to win.

The favoured Storm defeated the Nanaimo Buccaneers 5-2 on Thursday in Game 2 of a first-round Vancouver Island Junior Hockey League playoff series.

The Bucs had won Game 1 on the road thanks to a 46-save performance from goalie Austin Dendl, and even though Dendl was up over 40 stops again in Game 2, it wasn’t enough to fend off the Storm.

Ben Coghlan and Caleb Garet scored for Nanaimo, but Campbell River got goals from Cody Savey, Jory Swanson, Tynan Peacock, Noah Fiandager and Mitchell Finner and goalie Aaron de Kok made 23 saves.

See familiar places with fresh eyes: book a foraging tour in Vancouver, hike to hidden lakes in Squamish, or take an Indigenous cultural tour in Whistler, for example.

Head on a Culinary Journey

Expand your repertoire of restaurants on a foodie quest. Richmond’s Dumpling Trail is a must-do for fans of juicy dumplings, wontons, and bao. Revisit your favourite Italian eateries on Commercial Drive, or cross the bridge to the North Shore’s Shipyards District and hop between up-and-coming breweries.

Plan a getaway in the Sea-to-Sky Corridor. Stop in Squamish for craft cider and casual al fresco dining. Whistler – celebrated for its lively après scene – is also a foodie haven. You can do it all: sip BC wines and slurp local oysters; tuck into decadent goodies at an artisan bakery; or sip hand-crafted cocktails. Take a food tasting tour for the full experience.

Pemberton’s farms-with-a-view offer a chance to get closer to your food than ever before. Pick fresh berries (don’t forget to snag the homemade pies and preserves), and stop by a local eatery for ingredient-driven fare.

Celebrate Art and Culture

Indigenous people have lived on this land since time immemorial and their influences are deeply woven into the cultural fabric, from sea to sky. Learn about the living culture through an Indigenous-led walking tour through Stanley Park.

There are many ways to discover (or rediscover) the rich culture and thriving art scene. Cycle through historic neighbourhoods like Gastown, hunt for colourful urban art in Mount Pleasant, and find secret coffee shops along South Granville. Or, visit one of many museums, galleries, and gardens for a moment of quiet reflection.

Gear Up for Adventure

Though Vancouver’s glittering skyscrapers inspired the nickname “City of Glass,” nature is still just around the bend. For every delicious meal savoured, there’s a bike trail to explore. For every art gallery visited, there’s a mountain to summit.

You’ve probably driven the winding Sea-to-Sky Highway to visit communities between West Vancouver and Pemberton before, but there are always new ways to experience old favourites. View the Sea-to-Sky’s volcanic peaks with a flightseeing tour, take a gondola to great heights in Squamish or Whistler, raft through voracious glacier-fed rivers, or trot through Pemberton meadows by horseback.

Squamish – typically known for mountain activities like rock climbing, hiking, and biking – is also a steppingstone to Howe Sound. Book a guided paddleboard tour or kiteboarding lesson to spend time in the fjord. Meanwhile, adventure-filled Whistler needs no introduction. BC residents and visitors alike enjoy alpine sightseeing, lift-accessed downhill riding, and lake exploration, among other activities.

Want to get back the cabinets you love? Gleam Guard offers a quick, dust-free and cost-effective solution.

You love the style of your cabinets but not the worn appearance the years of love have brought … what if they could look like new again, without the expense and disruption of a full renovation?

Not only is it possible, but it’s quicker and easier than you might think!

“We’ve had many clients over the years who really thought they would need to invest in brand new cabinets. They’re so grateful when we can have their cabinets, shelving and even furniture looking brand new again – and in just one or two days,” says Tracy Booth, owner of Gleam Guard Cabinet Refinishing, serving Nanaimo and the Vancouver Island region.

Here’s a look at how refinishing works – and how it can work for you:

Choose experience. There are various approaches to cabinet refinishing, but to ensure you get a quality finish that will last, it’s essential to choose a knowledgeable, experienced professional, says Booth, who’s been professionally refinishing cabinets for more than 30 years. Even better, Gleam Guard enjoys an A+ BBB rating! Choose value. Hiring qualified refinishing professionals means your kitchen will get back the look you love at a fraction of the cost of new cabinets, costing as little as $2,000 instead of $20,000 to $30,000, for example. Choose the right process. Beyond the technique, it’s also important to consider the potential disruption of a large-scale renovation. With Gleam Guard, the process is not only dust-free – with no aggravating dust particles filling the air and settling through the house – but the entire job can be finished in just one or two days. Your Gleam Guard professional begins by cleaning the surface, then matching and applying the new finish. A wood floor finish protects your cabinets from hazards such as water damage, grease and dust, and ensures long-lasting results. Choose easy preparation. Don’t have time to empty drawers and cupboards? No problem! In fact, the only prep you need to do is clean off your countertops! “With no lengthy planning and demolition to worry about, the preparation time for our clients is typically less than 10 minutes,” Booth says. Choose flexibility. Have more surfaces that could use a little love? Gleam Guard’s professional refinishing is appropriate for all interior millwork, including built-in bookshelves, doors, windowsills, furniture and more. Your home will never look better!

And that’s just the landscape. There is a rich history here, too, from the Indigenous peoples whose stories, traditions, and stewardship of the land span millennia, to the ranchers, gold prospectors, and adventurers who braved unknown wilderness to traverse rough terrain and uncharted waterways.

Challenge yourself to try something new and experience some of BC’s history this summer through guest ranch stays, cultural tours, museum visits, guided trips into the backcountry, and more.

Drive Through Historic Gold Rush Country

Follow in the footsteps of 1860s Gold Rush prospectors and see how the mighty Fraser River shaped life in these parts. From Kamloops, head west toward Lillooet and “Mile 0” of the historic Cariboo Wagon Road. Visit sites ranging from preserved road houses to ghost towns and connect with locals in small towns along the way. Travel as far as Barkerville Historic Town, which brings this era to life with a restored townsite and costumed interpreters, and en route discover a vital Indigenous culture that dates back thousands of years.

The quintessential guest ranch experience awaits in the Cariboo and Chilcotin. Blake Jorgenson photo.

Stay at a Guest Ranch

If you’ve dreamed of long trail rides through peaceful pastures or into meadows bursting with wildflowers, consider a stay at one of BC’s many guest ranches, most of which are found in the Cariboo and Chilcotin. The quintessential guest ranch experience is, of course, riding the range, but when you need a break from the saddle, the possibilities are many. Whether you’re looking for a true cowboy experience (think: corralling livestock or mucking out stalls) or something a little less rugged (a day at the onsite spa, anyone?), you’ll find freedom and adventure in the wide-open spaces.

Cast a line in calm lakes and fast-moving rivers, hike into the mountains for expansive views, or stick close to the ranch – and to the cowboy theme – with wagon rides, lasso throwing, and, of course, tall tales around a campfire under a clear, starry sky.

Find Adventure in the Wild

With wide-open spaces come wide-open opportunities for adventure. The lakes and rivers of BC’s interior beckon with more places to fish than you can experience in a lifetime. There are calm waters for paddling – including multi-day wilderness canoe routes – and there are stretches of thrilling whitewater for adrenaline junkies. You can fly into the backcountry for some hardcore hiking and mountain biking from an alpine basecamp or saddle up for an off-the-grid horse-packing trip. Whichever option you choose, keep your camera close as you’re very likely to spot some of BC’s four-legged residents along the way.

Andrew Strain photo.

On the West Coast, we know that the province’s fertile valleys are ripe with, well, food and wine. But did you know that the area that stretches from the fields of the Fraser Valley to the vineyards of the Okanagan is also an ideal spot for outdoor play?

For every fresh peach that’s devoured, there’s an orchard to cycle through. For every Pinot that’s sipped, there’s a paddle that first needs to be dipped in a cool lake. So, embrace this delectable yin and yang, and rediscover your next great BC adventure.

Explore the Fraser Valley

In British Columbia, we’re blessed with natural settings that are as fruitful as they are beautiful. Rolling fields, vineyards, and wide-open spaces are all ready for exploration – and adventure.

A trip just east of the city to the Fraser Valley is the quickest way to immerse in farm life. Beginning in Langley, you can nibble your way from farm to farm to Abbotsford and beyond – all family-run operations that boast everything from fresh-from-the-garden fruits and vegetables to homemade waffles, ice creams, and ciders. Among the pretty landscapes and grazing cattle, you can ride the rapids during a river-rafting excursion or try your hand at catch-and-release sturgeon fishing near Chilliwack. To understand more about local Indigenous culture, opt for a guided tour of the area’s significant sites.

Road Trip to the Okanagan

There are many ways to journey to the Okanagan, and we know them all: the oft-travelled Highway 1; scenic Highway 7; Highway 5/Highway 97, a.k.a. “the fast route”; and Highway 3/Highway 97. But don’t rush along these corridors.

Fuel up at coffee shops and dig into some of the best home cooking anywhere at famed roadside diners in Hope. With bellies full, test your mettle on winding trails or seek out quiet spots at local green spaces. Pedal fast and furious at bike parks or visit historic ranches and outdoorsy resorts, and consider staying awhile.

Enjoy Lakeside Adventure

Spend more than five minutes in BC’s sun-kissed Okanagan, and you know that wine touring, craft breweries, cideries, and meaderies are prime for summer visits. Also prime for warmer months? Hours spent on a boat, swims in hidden coves, and long, leisurely paddles with your pod.

Beyond the shorelines, explore the bucolic valleys and the sustainable agritourism that fuel this lakeside lifestyle. Try two-wheeling among the vineyards – a novel way to visit local wineries near Penticton. Hike the Okanagan’s many trails, discover local Indigenous culture near Osoyoos, or visit a family farm for homegrown treats. Another option? Take it all in from a patio at one of the region’s premier winery restaurants. Cheers to that!

As British Columbians, we seek solace in the mountains, humbled and exhilarated by their magnitude. In eastern BC, dramatic landscapes – with their towering peaks, plunging falls, and charming towns – help us connect with nature on a grand scale. This summer, discover larger-than-life mountains and outdoor adventure in places like Fernie, Revelstoke, and Valemount. While the journey may take longer, the experience will leave you awestruck.

Explore Dramatic Mountain Landscapes

Once you’ve been, you know. Mountain ranges in this part of BC are on a different scale. Even the most seasoned adventurist is speechless at the sight of the Rocky Mountains. Mount Robson Provincial Park, home to the largest peak in the Canadian Rockies, is a must-see.

This area is home to seven UNESCO-designated parks, including Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park. Explore the mountain ranges with a lift-accessed alpine hike, or plan a stay in a backcountry lodge surrounded by ancient peaks.

Enjoy Outdoor Adventures

If you love the outdoors, you may have already paid a visit to the Kootenays or Valemount for the abundance of activities. But, once is never enough. From hiking to biking, paddling to golfing, there’s plenty to keep you entertained.

With four lift-accessed bike parks (including Golden’s Kicking Horse Mountain Resort) and 600-plus trails, the Kootenays are a mountain biker’s paradise. Whether your ascent is lift- or leg-powered, you can conquer some of BC’s best-known bike trails, maneuvring through tight singletrack and wheeling through alpine wildflowers.

Paddle the calm waterways or navigate raging rapids. Kootenay Lake, home to the world’s largest trout species, is prime for fishing. Tip: hire a guide for insider knowledge. Meanwhile, tee time is served with spectacular mountain views when you golf at one of the 25 championship courses in the Kootenays.

Experience Authentic Mountain Culture

A trip to BC’s mountain towns, as wild and vibrant as the nature surrounding them, is a rite of passage for every British Columbian. Tucked into valleys, on shores of rivers, and along old railway routes, communities like Fernie and Cranbrook are pulsing with energy and entrepreneurial spirit. Spoiler alert: the vibe is infectious, if you haven’t already been.

As you may have observed, a feverish pursuit of outdoor activities and great coffee are common traits, but each town has its own personality and charm. Swing by a java joint, like Nelson’s Oso Negro, to find friendly faces and a laid-back vibe. Absorb the ethos of each place by visiting Indigenous-owned businesses, exploring historic attractions, popping into boutiques, and meeting interesting characters.

In the mountains, a day of adventure almost always ends with an après. Sip craft beer on a sun-drenched patio, and live like the locals do – if only for a short while.

For physiotherapist Natasha Wilch, telehealth isn’t a Band-Aid solution to a temporary problem, it’s an essential tool with unique strengths.

“We’ve been offering telehealth since 2017, but many of my local clients hadn’t given it a try before COVID-19 hit. Our clinic is opening back up for in-person treatments now, but some clients loved it so much they want to continue online,” she says.

Wilch founded Symphony Rehabilitation in 2015 as a mobile service that improved access to physical therapy around Nanaimo, and added online appointments to expand her service. The clinic now offers treatment across BC, bringing her award-winning business to those in need.

Four reasons to try telehealth

Actively engage in your rehabilitation: “When some of my clients tried telehealth for the first time they were surprised at how much they had to work!” Wilch says. Online appointments are more than just a conversation; patients used to receiving hands-on treatment from a physiotherapist become active participants in their recovery online. “If your therapist was used to applying heat to your injury, for example, they might combine breath work with movement to help you reach those spots.”

Even when patients are able to drive to a clinic, the travel can sometimes negate their treatment — a concussion or back injury could be aggravated more by the travel than it is soothed by the physiotherapy. “Telehealth lets us improve the quality of care we can give our clients, and serve those communities.”

If you try online treatments, you’ll get to interact with your physiotherapist’s other skillsets.

Want to get back the cabinets you love? Gleam Guard offers a quick, dust-free and cost-effective solution.

We love the idea of a kitchen that looks as good as it works, but thinking about the dust, disruption and cost of a full-on renovation? That’s another story.

The good news is that it IS possible to get back to the cabinets and millwork you love quickly, and at a fraction of the cost of a new kitchen.

And even better news: the only prep you’ll need to do is clearing off your countertops!

“Many homeowners love the cabinets and millwork in their home, but over time, the finish has become worn or dull. They don’t want – or need – all-new cabinets, so the refinishing solution is perfect,” says Tracy Booth, owner of Gleam Guard Cabinet Refinishing, serving Nanaimo and the Vancouver Island region.

The key is to choose a professional with the experience to create a beautiful, lasting finish, using techniques that won’t fill the air with aggravating dust particles, says Booth, who’s been professionally refinishing cabinets for more than 30 years.

Here’s why it works:

Choosing qualified refinishing professionals means you’ll get your kitchen back to the way you want it, without the cost of new cabinets – as little as $2,000 instead of $20,000 to $30,000, for example.

You don’t need to remove old cabinets or replace door and drawer fronts – in fact, you don’t even need to empty your cupboards and drawers! “Our average prep time for customers is 10 minutes,” Booth says. (And if you don’t have much to clear off your countertops, it’s even less!)

The dust-free process starts with your Gleam Guard professional prepping the surface with a vigorous clean, then matching and applying the new finish. A wood floor finish provides a long-wearing result, protecting your cabinets from hazards such as water damage, grease and dust.

There’s no lengthy planning, demolition and construction period. “Our trained cabinet refinishing professionals will have your cabinets looking great and ready to go within one to two days,” Booth says.

All interior millwork can be refinished, so think beyond the kitchen to your built-in bookshelves, doors, windowsills, furniture and more.

As we focus our attentions closer to home, finding ways to make our spaces more inviting takes on new importance.

Where we might have planned a boutique hotel getaway or sunny outdoor escape, this year it’s time to make our own spaces welcome “destinations” we love coming home to, says Lianna Armstrong, owner and designer of Nanaimo’s Evolve Interior Designs.

Welcome home

After studying in Toronto, then building her career and business in Vancouver, Lianna is excited to be back in her childhood home of Nanaimo, near family and friends – and as a first-time homeowner, undertaking her first renovation as her own client, she adds with a smile.

“I grew up here and moved away for college and career, but I’ve wanted to come back for years and years. Now I’ve bought my childhood home,” says Lianna, an award-winning designer serving both residential and commercial clients, who brings 17 years of experience to everything from small renovations to full new builds.

With her early career based around kitchen and bath design, with a specialty in custom millwork, opening her own design company a decade ago let her expand her scope and help clients fully discover the possibilities of their spaces.

“I love the creativity of interior design and the uniqueness of each project and client. I am never doing the same project twice.”

Creating your vision

With a focus on approachability, the first step with any project is sitting down with clients to learn more about them, and their goals for their space.

“I really try to listen and be open – I like my clients to participate, and to really feel they have a say throughout the project,” Lianna says, sharing a few questions for clients to think about heading into a potential renovation or design project.

What’s your style? In addition to thinking about what you hope to see for your space, starting a Pinterest board or magazine clipping file can help fine-tune what you like, or don’t like.

Every fall, parents are tasked with managing back-to-school transitions. Usually this means shopping for or gathering school supplies or seasonal clothes, registering for activities or helping children manage back-to-school excitement or worries. But with COVID-19, the start of this school year feels very different.

Our research shows that due to COVID-19, parents and children are experiencing greater levels of anxiety and stress. With contentious and sometimes shifting information about the process, these feelings of uncertainty may increase.

Parents and children may feel nervous about contracting and spreading COVID-19 at school, frustrated by vague reopening plans and skeptical of whether children are able to follow social-distancing and mask protocols.

While levels of anxiety and stress may be high, parents play an influential role in helping children cope, encouraging a positive back-to-school transition and helping to reduce children’s anxiety and worries.

Have honest and open discussions

In psychology, we use the phrase, “what you resist, persists” to describe how avoiding important discussions can actually lead to more persistent feelings of anxiety in children.

It’s important to have honest, factual and open conversations with your child about COVID-19 and its implications for returning to school. Tailor the depth and breadth of conversations based on your child’s age and maturity level.

For example, with a younger child in grades 1 to 3, you could spend some time talking about what might look different this year. Their class size may be smaller and teachers and educators may be wearing masks. Extra-curricular activities or regular school activities (such as some forms of music) might be cancelled.

For older children, you could ask if there are specific things they are worried or concerned about, and talk these through with them.

You can help children and youth identify their role in staying safe — such as avoiding touching their face, washing their hands or using hand-sanitizer and keeping their distance from others. Use coping-focused language that emphasizes the active role that children, youth and adults are taking to make sure things go well (following instructions, engaging in good hygiene), rather than focusing on things that are out of their control (like if a student gets COVID-19).

Name fears to tame fears

As child clinicians, we often encourage parents to use the “name-it-to-tame-it” strategy. First, parents can help their child identify their concerns by asking them what they’re worried about. Then, parents can help their child “name” the worry or concern by labelling it. For example, younger children might name their fear the Worry Monster. Simply labelling the emotion as anxiety can be helpful for older children and teenagers.

Naming the worry often helps tame the fear by helping children build understanding about what they’re feeling. It also gives parents and children a common emotion language that can be used in future discussions, and provides an opportunity for parents to provide emotional support and coping strategies. These strategies include deep breathing and using coping-focused language like: “I feel better when I talk about my worries.”

Children often want reassurance their fears won’t come true. It may be tempting for parents to say “Everything will be OK!” or “No one will get sick!” But such words can prevent children from facing their fears and developing problem-solving and coping skills. They can also prevent children from taking COVID-19 preventative measures (like social distancing) as they may perceive the risk to be low or non-existent.

Acknowledge and support your child in the discomfort that there are some things that may be out of our control, and that it’s best to focus on what we can control.

Listen, validate, help to problem-solve

When your child expresses (or demonstrates) they’re struggling, start by listening carefully to their concern. Put devices away, so you can provide undivided attention. Then, try validating your child’s emotion by making a caring statement that reflects what they just said, such as: “I can understand why you feel worried about returning to school, especially when there are so many changes happening because of COVID-19.” Identifying reasons why your child might be feeling worried or anxious will make them feel understood.

Help your child face their fears by promoting problem-solving. Together, identify a few possible solutions and then help them identify which solution seems best. You can discuss different options or role-play solutions to help your child build confidence. Encourage your child to try out the solution in real life and discuss whether or not it worked. If not, try picking a different solution to test!

Focus on things going well

It’s important to acknowledge children’s worries and anxieties, but parents should also motivate their children to focus on the things they might be looking forward to. Children are likely excited to see friends, peers or teachers in person. They may positively anticipate a daily school routine and take pride in their role as a student or in minimizing COVID-related risks.

Before school starts, you can ask, “What are you looking forward to on your first day of school?” or “What have you missed about school?” Once school starts, you can ask: “What was the best thing that happened today?”

Build a predictable routine

Usually, things we can control makes us feel safe because they are predictable, while things that fall out of our control can lead to feelings of anxiety because they are unpredictable.

One way parents can help children build feelings of safety and security during COVID-19 is by creating a predictable daily routine, beginning with consistent times for meals, waking up and going to bed.

Before or after school, engage your child in planned, shared activities like making breakfast, reading together or going to the park.

Model calm behaviour

It’s OK for parents to feel uncertain and worried. However, as much as possible, try to model calm and confident attitudes about returning to school for your child and use cheerful, positive messages when saying goodbye, and empathy when responding to tantrums, protests or crying.

Research suggests that children notice how their parents feel and pick up on subtle cues, such as scared facial expressions or cautious tones of voice.

Parents who care for their own well-being and mental health are better able to care for their children’s — so be kind to yourself and seek out those you can turn to when you are struggling or troubled by these unprecedented circumstances. You can also seek mental health services.

While this year’s transition back to school is different, we can help children feel optimistic by listening to and validating their worries, teaching them coping strategies, reviewing safety protocols and supporting them when they find things difficult. Ultimately, our kids need us to lead the way for a successful back-to-school transition and to develop the lifelong skills they need for navigating challenges.

Re: Green Thumb developer asking for ‘urban node’ land use, Aug. 5.

Does anyone remember when the property was sold, the owners assured the community it would stay a nursery for at least 10 years? I guess they were dog years.

Looking at the proposal, it looks neither friendly nor approachable to the general public. It looks like a very cold fortress. It looks out of place. There is no need for high-rises on this property. It will dwarf all the surrounding properties. It just doesn’t fit into Nanaimo.

The traffic on Uplands Drive is already too much and the developers are looking to add one of their entrances on Uplands? It’s a two-lane road. I don’t think you could possibly add another two lanes.

We are still in COVID and businesses are struggling to stay open. What kind of boutiques are they expecting to be excited about moving into this complex? I see an issue with parking for the owners or renters let alone any customers that would wish to shop in the stores.

I know the current city council is putting up as many apartments, high-rises and any other thing that will generate more taxes but you have to look at the obvious. Nanaimo is not a high-society type of city.

It doesn’t matter how many bicycle lanes you put in either. Very few people use them. The age component of this city is prohibitive to this type of development. There is just so much wrong with this proposal for that site. Let’s not let this happen.

To the editor,

Re: Green Thumb developer asking for ‘urban node’ land use, Aug. 5.

I for one, and as a long time resident of Nanaimo and Uplands Drive, have witnessed the decimation of a forest and green spaces from Hammond Bay Road to Rutherford for some time now. Monster warehouse businesses and forebodingly huge condo developments are scarring the landscape.

The increased noise and carbon pollution has made it impossible for any sidewalking pedestrian enjoyment now.

We will no doubt see a die-off of the trees that made a lovely sight in spring and fall because of the added heat from the buildings and carbon build-up to come.

With the many new condos, a huge strain will be put on the infrastructure, water supply and heavy road use that will require repairs.

In my opinion the concrete jungle proposed for the Green Thumb property is the most poorly thought-out idea of all.

When the increasing population fill the condos for sale, it just makes common sense to save the remaining green space and more urgent to give the north enders a much-needed location here for a park, and cleaner, healthier air to breathe.

Reading the plan, one can only envision a few patches of green and short trails to more concrete. Private parking only and more traffic snarls in the whole area.

And 2,500 units, plus high-rises. Yikes!

Future vision is necessary right now, because once cemented and paved it is gone forever.

British Columbians are doing well through this pandemic largely because of outstanding leadership and a supportive public. The United States has demonstrated how bizarre leadership reflects on public response. My grandchildren live in Houston, Texas, and I’m painfully informed on how rapidly this virus can spread in a poorly informed or uncooperative population.

For most of us, we can live pretty normal lives with some inconvenience. I reduce my shopping trips but purchase more during my fewer trips. When I know social distancing will be problematic, I wear a mask.

I ask, plead, with everyone to not become complacent with all the good we’ve done. I know we have a long way to go to hit the levels of the U.S. I am also encouraged by the talk of promising vaccines in the news. The reality is that most of us have been aware of the virus for less than six months and you can be sure it will be at least six months before you and I will have an effective needle in our arms.

I wear a mask to keep my germs from you. When you wear a mask, we both win. I know masks can be an annoyance at first. I have a big head which exacerbated the annoyance.

Jock Finlayson is executive vice president and chief policy officer of the Business Council of British Columbia","From following health advice and ‘doing no harm,’ to not hiking fees – one business expert has a number of suggestions

Statistics Canada’s July Labour Force Survey contained mostly good news for nervous British Columbians trying to adjust to life in the strange world of COVID-19.

Employment jumped by 70,000 for the month, meaning B.C. has recouped about 60 per cent of the 400,000 jobs lost between February and April. However, that still leaves us with 165,000 fewer jobs than six months ago, equivalent to three years of employment growth in normal economic circumstances. And most of the jobs added since April are part-time positions, which suggests a high level of “underemployment” in the province.

Other data also points to a challenging economic environment. The tourism industry is on life support amid the worst business conditions on record. British Columbia’s merchandise exports have been falling over the course of 2020; in June, for example, they were 16 per cent lower than a year ago. The Canada-U.S. border remains shut with no sign it will be opening again anytime soon. And business insolvencies are mounting.

All of this underscores the risk that B.C.’s nascent economic recovery could stall in the coming months. Against this backdrop, what can the provincial government do to put the economy on a solid growth footing?

Several suggestions come to mind.

The first is to follow the physician’s advice and “do no harm.” In particular, the next 6-12 months is not a time for governments to be hiking taxes or fees or adding to the heavy regulatory burdens that companies doing business in B.C. already face.

Second, the province should consider cutting the provincial sales tax (PST) to assist in bolstering the consumer spending that drives much of our economy.

Reducing the PST from 7 per cent to 3.5 per cent for two years would boost consumer outlays, notably on durable and semi-durable goods. It would also lower costs for businesses, which pay roughly 40 per cent of the PST taxes collected by the provincial government, thereby encouraging more companies to invest and expand in B.C. Meanwhile, over the next two years the province can explore options for long-term sales tax reform with a view to introducing a modernized, made-in-B.C. consumption tax in January 2023.

Another suggestion is to extend the provincial tax deferrals for businesses – covering the PST and the Employer Health Tax — announced in late March until the end of the year, instead of ending the deferrals on September 30. The government could also look at allowing companies that owe taxes to pay the monies owed over a 12 month period rather than all at once. These steps would give companies more time to strengthen liquidity and rebuild cash balances, thus reducing the number of firms that end up closing their doors for good.

The province can also support economic recovery by increasing its own $10 billion annual capital budget. Proceeding immediately with badly needed major projects — like the George Massey Tunnel replacement — makes sense.

So does a program to speed up the repair and refurbishment of existing public sector assets like buildings, highways, and post-secondary education facilities. Small-scale capital spending projects can be advanced more quickly than large projects because they don’t usually require permits or extensive up-front planning and engineering work.

B.C. policymakers should also be looking to fast-track private sector investments wherever possible to help kick-start the economy and restore the 30,000 construction jobs lost since February. Many B.C. companies are willing and able to spend their own money on everything from pipelines and industrial plants to mines and research labs. In addition, there are dozens of multi-family residential development projects in the queue in municipalities across the lower mainland, Greater Victoria and the Okanagan. Now would be an excellent time for the province to work with and if necessary compel local governments to proceed with these projects with no or minimal delays.

The NDP government undoubtedly has other ideas for moving the economy forward. We’ll learn more when Finance Minister Carole James delivers her next economic and fiscal update in September.

Re: Nanaimo’s south-end residents oppose concentration of supportive housing, July 16.

In 2018 our infamous tent city was disbanded and residents were placed in temporary trailer accommodation at sites on Labieux Road and Terminal Avenue. Those two facilities accommodate 170 individuals. Both neighbourhoods have suffered and continue to suffer effects of crime and social disorder.

In the coming months, 190 permanent supportive units will be built, or a net gain of 20 units if all the proposed building takes place. I am not going to argue against a net gain of 20 units but it does beg the question: What do we do with the hundreds of other homeless individuals on our streets?

When the facility on Terminal Avenue was put into our Newcastle neighbourhood, I predicted with unerring accuracy what would happen. Although I was dismissed as a reactive NIMBY, it has been far worse than even I expected. Now unfortunately I have to make my next prediction. The overconcentration of supportive housing services in the downtown corridor will lead to the creation of a ghetto that will extend from Terminal to Nicol Street. Drug dealers will set up shop to prey on those who live on the street and camp all over the city. Downtown businesses that were already struggling before COVID will finally give up and leave. Residents of the south end who have worked so hard to revitalize their community will look on in despair at crime and social disorder on the streets.

RELATED: Province announces plans for permanent supportive housing on Terminal and three other sites

Our MLA Sheila Malcolmson says that she wants to see these units downtown where residents can access services. There is a community in Vancouver with lots of homeless people and services; it’s called the Downtown Eastside.

Newcastle, downtown and the south end are very generous communities but this proposed plan by the city and B.C. Housing clearly exceeds our carrying capacity to care for the homeless and integrate them effectively into our communities. What would it take for your neighbourhood to do its civic duty and step up to share the responsibility of caring for the most vulnerable in our city? A problem this large is not going away any time soon. We all need a healthy, vibrant downtown core.

There is growing inequality between the richest and the poorest people of Canada. A recent estimate by philanthropist and Frank Giustra says that the wealthiest one per cent now own 50 cent of all the wealth. The bottom 50 per cent have less than nothing, because of all the debt.

It pains me to think that some people in Nanaimo would even begrudge a homeless person the use of a shopping cart for their meagre possessions. Once you de-humanize a population it is easier to be cruel to them, history has shown us. If you don’t have a heart you are really poor then. You have lost the most valuable quality of a human being. What could be worse? It means you have de-humanized yourself.

On the other hand, taxes are costly to administer, stifle investment, and are unevenly applied. This can bog down the very economic growth we rely on to generate much-needed government revenue.

British Columbia’s Provincial Sales Tax (PST) is one of these taxes.

B.C. introduced the PST when the Queen was a princess. A lot has changed over the last 70 years. Unfortunately, the PST has aged poorly and is now an archaic tool in a modern world that doesn’t meet the needs of people, the economy, or governments today. It unfairly impacts medium and low-income households and misses a large part of the new economy.

Simply put, the PST needs to retire. It has become a web of rules, complexity, and layers that few understand – and some try to avoid. For example, a bicycle is PST exempt, but an E-bicycle or unicycle is not. Bike parts are exempt if bought with the original bike but require PST to be paid if bought on their own. Propane from the same tank if used for one business purpose is PST exempt but if used for another business purpose requires PST to be paid. How is that possible?

As we continue to fight COVID-19, we need to start taking bold action to rebuild our economy. This week, a coalition of community, post-secondary and business leaders from small and large firms released Stronger Today, Starting Tomorrow – an economic plan for BC families and businesses. Among the 24 recommendations included in this Plan is an immediate halving of the PST to 3.5 per cent for two years to help families, businesses, and our economy.

Paying less tax will means British Columbians will have a bit more money to spend through these uncertain times. Reducing the PST will help families make ends meet, free up funds for household necessities or a take up a new family activity.

The question we should be asking in Dawson Creek, Kelowna, Nanaimo, and everywhere in between is if a PST cut should just be a temporary first step. For a truly lasting impact, the Stronger Tomorrow plan recommends evolving the almost 75-year-old PST into a made-in-B.C. value added tax system.

To be clear, this is not about bringing back the HST that was rejected by British Columbians and controlled by federal government rules. The recommendation is a plan is a made-in-B.C. tax where the decisions about how the tax system works – like determining which items are taxed and those that are exempt – would be decided by British Columbians, not Ottawa. For instance, all types of food consumption and food services could be tax-exempt and lower-income households could get a tax credit like the GST credit.

Reforming the sales tax system would bring two big benefits. First, a modern tax system would spread the tax across a wider array of goods or services, which means everyone pays their fair share across the economy, while creating a real opportunity to reduce the tax rate below the current seven per cent.

The second big benefit is job creation. With the sales tax system modernized, business wouldn’t be paying a provincial tax that has to be included in their prices. That cost would be removed, and customers won’t end up paying tax on taxes paid by the business. Businesses can put their savings into growing their company and creating more jobs – which in turn contributes to government revenues.

The next two years offer plenty of time for the provincial government to consult with British Columbians about real, meaningful tax reform.

But British Columbians struggling through the downturn don’t have two years to figure out how to make ends meet – they need help right now. B.C. families could get tangible help with their household costs by the government taking action and cutting the PST today.

Polls around the world demonstrate that most people don’t want a return to the ‘old normal.’

Many have used the pandemic’s gift of time to reflect as well as to look after each other. We have experienced the inadequacies of global business systems based on cheapness and exploitation. We are aware that governing elites will resist losing their privileges and that ordinary people stand to lose everything in the process of change. Whether the examples of mutual aid that sprang up everywhere will overcome the old ways remains to be seen.

But we should recognize the We Charity muddle of Trudeaus, Morneaus and Kielburgers as the result of ‘old normal’ manipulation of money as the means to achieve worthwhile goals. Even the goals were diminished.

The Trudeau, Morneau and Kielburger families are entangled in a conflict of their own making as complicated as the organizational complexities that morphed We Charity, Me to We social enterprise and Toronto real estate worth more than $40 million out of young Craig Kielburger’s original Free the Children dream. While the salaries drawn by the co-founding brothers from Me to We are far less than those of most major Canadian charity CEOs, the passage of money to and from each segment of the Kielburger complex must be perplexing to charities directorate of the Canada Revenue Agency, given that the wives of both Craig and Marc are executive employees of the conglomerate, and the donations of the Kielburger parents pass through the social enterprise to the charity, mixed in with real estate acquisitions worth two-thirds of the group’s assets.

Perhaps it’s because Fred and Theresa Kielburger were teachers before they got into renovating and flipping Toronto buildings that the target clientèle of We Charity is schoolchildren. The concept is that change can be effected by influencing the young, who will improve society as adults. Not a very threatening concept to worry teachers or administrators or school boards as much as the forthright Free the Children original.

COLUMN: Vulnerability to global disasters is our own making

Nutritionist Barbara Bray, writing for the prestigious British Nutrition Society, borrows a term from the U.S. military and suggests that the pandemic has made us ‘volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous.’ A new normal must be simpler and locally based. Taking the example of food systems, we have seen the food service sector disrupted, industrial farmers forced to dump food supplies with failed distribution lines and people unable to access food without monetary bailouts and local aid. Situations in the impoverished countries shows the onset of widespread starvation.

Bray relates that the UN Food and Agriculture Organization is warning of devastating effects on poverty, food security and inequality as it plans new international guidelines which must stress resilient food systems capable of delivering food security with essential nutrition. Wrong decisions and indecisiveness “could lead to increased inequality, hunger and poverty.” She quotes Norman Borlaug (who warned us that his green revolution was a mere stopgap): “the first essential component of social justice is adequate food for all mankind.”

What we don’t need are house flipping, muddled charity or confused government leaders.

To the editor,

Re: City starts talking about possible budget items for next year, July 22.

I am astonished by how out of touch the majority of the city councillors are with the city’s taxpayers right now.

With many Nanaimo businesses and their employees in a situation of barely holding on right now as they attempt to survive and recover from COVID, they are sitting around a council table brainstorming on how to spend more money, not to provide the badly needed relief that Nanaimo taxpayers are looking for.

The cavalier comments by Coun. Don Bonner that there is nothing preventing the city from funding new initiatives that are clearly outside of the city charter and a duplication of services are breathtaking in their ignorance that continued tax increases well in excess of Nanaimo’s cost of living index are unsustainable.

Rather than approaching the 2021 budget from a starting point of imposing a minimum of a three-per-cent increase on city taxpayers, I would suggest that you focus on looking at ways to reduce or maintain taxes level and still maintain basic services at the same time.

As a sign of good faith, perhaps the councillors who are supporting all of these increases and projects should publicly volunteer to cut their wages by three per cent for the balance of 2020 and 2021 to show solidarity with the citizens of Nanaimo.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Homeowners paying for Nanaimo council’s tax-and-spend ways

To the editor,

Re: City starts talking about possible budget items for next year, July 22.

I was dismayed and disappointed to read that Nanaimo city council is already thinking tax increase for next year’s municipal budget. With continued record unemployment, struggling businesses, predictions of economic recovery taking several years, rising COVID-19 rates, this is our new ‘normal.’ Why, then, oh why, is the council even considering an increase? At times like this, a starting point of even three per cent is just not warranted, especially after this year’s 4.5-per-cent increase. And that’s before even looking at possible reductions in property assessment values. While I applaud the city for being responsible and conducting multi-year financial planning, that plan needs revision so it reflects current economic conditions.

Many families (read taxpayers/voters) have had to drastically re-structure their financial situation. With severely reduced income, many have deferred or even put off needed expenditures like children’s eyeglasses.

We’re already seeing cost increases in basics like food, clothing, and footwear. This is not a time to think about pet projects or adding staff. If a reduction is not palatable, consider a net zero increase, or at least limiting the increase to inflation, which the Bank of Canada has forecast to be 0.6 per cent.

C’mon, Nanaimo city council. Remember where the money comes from and, if we’re truly ‘in this together,’ how about doing your part by re-thinking any more tax increases?

As for the street people’s ‘possessions,’ most of the the stuff has been picked up from here and there. In some cases, items are stolen and much of the stuff is later left or dumped on our streets, outside our homes and in our parks, where we are afraid to now let our kids play.

Stop the ‘poor them’ attitude. This stolen property and littering problem is costing us taxpayers loads of money. It’s also forcing us to pay more for items at the grocery stores, because these companies are surely passing the theft costs on to us.

Those who write letters of support for people on the streets, therefore praising thefts, must walk the walk; help these poor lost souls, take them into your homes.

Taxpayers should not be forced to pay the costs that are never ending, because we hardly have enough money now to live and with tax increases and more of this spending and that, we will soon be forced to live on the streets.

To the editor,

We need to have more conversation about how to decriminalize drug use. It could take many different forms. At its worst, it could be a money-making scam, with easy ticketing for police and significant fines. While incarceration is an evil that we need to avoid, many places already employ de facto decriminalization, in which charges of simple possession are not pursued. A system of ticketing would worsen the situation, in that case.

Decrim also usually includes confiscation. If a drug user is turning to crime to finance their purchases, this would create a need to use more crime to raise the funds for another purchase.

While the calls for decrim from police and politicians seem superficially to be good, we need some brilliant ideas about how to most effectively make change in a way that will improve lives, and reduce the social impacts of problematic drug use. Decrim would also do nothing to address the life and death situation of an illegal, poisoned drug supply.

Some would include forced treatment in this kind of change. The success rates of treatment are quite dismal for those who want treatment, and much worse for forced treatment.

I hope that attention will be paid to carefully choosing the path for much-needed change. How we make that change is critical, for those who struggle with addiction, and for society as a whole.

Dear Editor,

It is now a practice, before a public event, to have an Indigenous land acknowledgement.

Is this mere tokenism under the guise of “Truth and Reconciliation” with Indigenous communities even when our province continues to have a colonial name, flag and coat-of-arms?

“British Columbia” was chosen on July 24, 1858, by Queen Victoria, a monarch who never set foot in these parts.

Her decision, though said to be hesitant, was unilateral and without consultation with the mostly Indigenous people who lived here.

Vancouver Island was a British colony for just 22 years.

The mainland was a colony for 13 years.

British rule ended in 1871.

WATCH: Celebrating Metis culture and history at Louis Riel Day

Yet we cling to the “British” moniker while ignoring the more than 10,000 years that Indigenous communities inhabited these lands, and our 149 years in the Canadian Confederation.

Some will argue that a name change will dishonour British roots and heritage, and, oh yes, tradition.

They conveniently forget the roots, heritage, and traditions of our Indigenous communities, who have lived here for more than 10,000 years, and, those of us who are not of British (today a minority) ancestry.

We are not British. And Columbus never came here.

We have laboured under this colonial pretension for too long.

Besides the abbreviated “B.C.” commonly used today is meaningless.

When can we take pride in our province’s name, flag, and coat-of-arms?

The government should ask the Indigenous peoples to come up with a new name that will reflect the province’s more than 10,000 years of history, awesome grandeur, diverse bio-geoclimatic zones, and its mosaic of multi-cultures.

The new name – hopefully easily pronounceable, spelled and short – could be proclaimed on the 150th anniversary of the province’s entry into the Canadian confederation on July 20, 2021.

This would be in accordance with Premier John Horgan’s recent challenge of “thinking outside the box” in the “new normal” after the COVID-19 pandemic.

A new name will demonstrate solid confidence in ourselves as a province that is inclusive of all its residents, rather than clinging to coattails of British colonists.

The name, of course, cannot be fully changed overnight because it is a complex matter.

However, many countries had the fortitude to make a start and go through a liberating process of choosing a new name – such as Ghana, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Zambia, Mali – and implementing it fast.

If we keep the status quo, we are only confirming that all our talk about reconciliation with our Indigenous peoples is only tokenism and not full and respectful inclusion.

To the editor,

Re: City council’s special-interest projects are boosting property taxes too high, Letters, July 1.

Both writers are right on. This mayor and council are tax-and-spend politicians by their performance.

As Nanaimo falls apart all over the city, more bike lanes. The unreliable weather here makes regular bike riding not likely – kind of like the lower-wage worker waiting for a bus on a statutory holiday, they have to work on.

Then taxing by assessment of value. They built two $550,000 houses two blocks away, up goes our assessment and taxes. Gentrification in the south end.

With the automatic monthly tax payment withdrawal from our bank, we owed $95 more at tax time. The city stated on the tax bill our monthly withdrawal is going up $25 in July. This is an automatic $205 at least of a tax hike coming.

Television journalists work before the announcement of the new leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, in Ottawa on Sunday, Aug. 23, 2020. As many as 40 local television outlets and up to 200 Canadian radio stations could be forced to close in the next three years as the pandemic adds to financial pressures media companies were facing before COVID-19, according to a new study from a media advocacy group. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang

As many as 40 local television outlets and 200 Canadian radio stations could be forced to close in the next three years as the financial pressures faced by media companies intensify under the COVID-19 pandemic, suggests a new study from an industry advocacy group.

The Canadian Association of Broadcasters issued a report on Wednesday warning of potential closures and widespread job cuts as private TV and radio broadcasters face a cumulative projected revenue shortfall of up to $1.06 billion by the end of 2022.

Most vulnerable are the country’s AM radio stations, the report said, as well as other independent private radio and TV operations in smaller markets across the country.

The study, titled “The Crisis in Canadian Media and the Future of Local Broadcasting,” was commissioned by the CAB, which represents the majority of private broadcasters in Canada, and conducted through Winnipeg-based independent media economics consultancy Communications Management Inc.

The CAB says it’s concerned about the fallout from a substantial erosion in local advertising revenues over recent months.

Radio stations may be hardest hit in the short term, the report suggests, partly due to many advertisers pulling back on their spending in the pandemic and hastening a decline in the media industry’s revenues.

Private radio ad revenues are expected to be $383 million below last year, it said.

The report’s projections suggest that without further government support those declines could mean as many as 50 private local radio stations go out of business over the next four to six months.

Another 150 radio stations could topple in the 18 months that follow, it said, leading to as many as 2,000 job losses.

TV stations could risk a similar fate with roughly 40 of Canada’s 94 private TV broadcasters in danger of closing within one to three years, the research predicts.

The CAB is calling on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to take swift action by establishing a “more fair and sustainable future” for local media.

Last month, the organization sent an emergency application to the CRTC requesting permission for broadcasters to be relieved of certain terms of their agreements, such as spending requirements on Canadian programming, for the broadcast year that ends Aug. 31.

Lenore Gibson, chair of the CAB, said broadcasters have “done their utmost to cut expenses” in areas such as administration, and “the last thing that they want to do is cut into programming costs, but that’s the only area that’s left now.”

The CAB is urging the federal government to provide emergency regulatory relief as well as greater “targeted support” for the industry starting this fall.

Without greater financial measures in place, the CAB says the effects could leave many communities with only national and international media organizations to provide them with most of their news, effectively eliminating most community coverage of local politics, health and education in some regions of the country.

The committee had 3,625 responses to an online survey of priorities for Finance Minister Carole James’ next budget, with 1,362 written and video submissions and 281 presentations, all delivered by video and phone conference during June.

“This year, we saw the highest level of participation in nearly 10 years, with British Columbians describing how the COVID-19 pandemic exposed gaps in supports and services and impacted groups differently,” D’Eith said in submitting the committee’s report. “The committee recognizes that the next budget is an opportunity to address these gaps and inequities and continue to make progress on reconciliation, diversity, inclusion and accessibility.”

Columbia River-Revelstoke MLA Doug Clovechok, the deputy chair, said online access is a significant challenge, particularly for rural and remote communities. The report notes that health care, education and work have become more dependent on digital networks, along with entertainment, community and family connections restricted by public health orders.

B.C. colleges and universities are making rapid shifts to online learning, as the public school system gears up for in-person studies with protective measures. They are also dealing with a the loss of tuition revenue as international and domestic students, with Camosun College and Okanagan College among those expecting staff cuts, and calling for the ability to use reserve funds to get through the pandemic.

“The availability of French immersion distance learning courses is close to zero,” executive director Glyn Lewis said Aug. 21. “Additionally, some parents are being forced to de-register from their local programs if they choose to home school.”

The finance committee made 124 recommendations for the next provincial budget, with the B.C. government dealing with a sudden record deficit for the current year estimated at $13.5 billion. The NDP government got unanimous consent in an emergency session this spring to borrow an additional $5 billion for pandemic relief and recovery programs, with $1.5 billion of that still to be allocated for business recovery in September.

B.C. Premier John Horgan said while the decision is welcome, the decades-long dispute isn’t going away.

“While this decision is a victory for B.C.’s lumber producers, immediate relief is unlikely,” Horgan said in a statement Aug. 24. “Our work continues until we bring an end to the unfair U.S. duties on Canadian softwood exports.”

Before COVID-19, Dame Nature Restaurant — surrounded by a train station, hotel and offices in downtown Montreal — was boosted by its location. In a typical September, the restaurant relies on office workers and other commuters for traffic once the tourism season slows down, says manager Cezar Narea.

Now he envies the restaurants an hour outside the city, where locals hoping to avoid parking, construction and crowded sidewalks are flocking instead.

Dame Nature isn’t the only business seeing the tables turn, according to a new survey by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which suggests that businesses in Canada’s city centres are struggling more than their suburban and rural counterparts.

CFIB data released on Wednesday indicates that 22 per cent of businesses polled in urban cores are at normal levels of sales compared to 37 per cent in rural areas.

Overall, 66 per cent of survey respondents say their business is fully open, with 40 per cent are fully staffed and 28 per cent are making normal sales. CFIB represents about 110,000 small- and medium-sized businesses, and 5,119 members responded to the online survey, which ran from Aug. 13 to Aug. 18.

The polling industry’s professional body, the Marketing Research and Intelligence Association, says online surveys cannot be assigned a margin of error because they do not randomly sample the population.

Like Narea, CFIB executive vice-president Laura Jones says that empty downtown offices and non-existent international tourism are likely to blame.

Narea estimates that sales are still down about 80 per cent, with the restaurant relying on a trickle interest from maitanence staff at nearby buildings. Once in a while, his regular patrons will drop by to say hello — only to announce they are picking up something from the office, where they won’t return until January 2021 or beyond.

With government support programs coming to an end, and trains remaining on reduced schedules, Narea says he is worried about whether they will lose their 12 former staffers for good.

“Everybody is trying to avoid downtown Montreal,” he says. “It’s going to be a very bad situation for us.”

Trans Mountain and Coastal Gaslink pipelines, the Site C hydro dam and lately the forest industry have carried on despite coronavirus setbacks and restrictions, and more steady resource industry work is needed to dig out of the huge deficit hole created by the pandemic, a national industry report recommends.

Resource and manufacturing industries have the potential to add as much as 17 per cent to Canada’s gross domestic product and $200 billion in labour earnings, according to economic modelling conducted for the Task Force for Real Jobs, Real Recovery, which released recommendations from a summer-long research project Aug. 19.

Sponsors of the Task Force for Real Jobs, Real Recovery include the Canadian, B.C., Alberta and Atlantic Chambers of Commerce, the Aboriginal Skilled Workers Association, Alberta Chamber of Resources, Alberta Forest Products Association, B.C. Construction Association, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada.

Advisors to the resource task force include Karen Ogen-Toews, elected councillor with the Wet’suwet’en First Nation in northwest B.C. and CEO of the First Nations LNG Alliance; Fort St. John Mayor Lori Ackerman; Joseph Quesnel, an Indigenous policy researcher; and Michel Trépanier, president of the Quebec Building Trades.

Among the task force’s recommendations is to amend the Indian Act, which blocks the use of reserve land as collateral for financing, and improve Indigenous consultation and participation in training and work.

“Before the pandemic, weak productivity growth, an aging population and trade impacts in early 2020 already put Canada on a path for economic growth under two per cent,” the report says. “Statistics Canada reported the Canadian economy shrank 11.6 per cent in April, the largest monthly drop on record.”

The report advocates climate strategies to reduce emissions from resource production and use, plus the development of hydrogen and small nuclear power sources. It calls for a nation-wide “forest bio-economy framework,” similar to efforts in B.C. to maximize timber use and use more renewable fuels.

RELATED: B.C. moves to allow three years of budget deficits

After a run of surplus budgets that paid down debt, B.C.’s deficit ballooned to an estimated $12.5 billion in the finance ministry’s initial estimate of the pandemic impact. Finance Minister Carole James went to the legislature in July for an additional $1 billion in spending authority to match federal emergency funds to keep municipalities and transit systems running.

James changed B.C. budget legislation in June to authorize up to three years of budget deficits. The Economic Stabilization Act formalized moves already made by the province, including postponing commercial property tax payments, and business filing and paying provincial sales tax, carbon tax, motor fuel tax, tobacco tax and hotel tax until the end of September.

Those bills come due for businesses still trying to recover and rehire staff, as governments across Canada face unprecedented spending demands and a historic slump in tax and other revenues.

With B.C.’s COVID-19 rent supplement ending this month, eviction notices may be issued for tenants who don’t pay their full rent and utilities on Sept. 1.

The B.C. government has also issued forms for landlords to implement its repayment plan for unpaid rent accumulated during the coronavirus pandemic. Repayment plans give tenants until July 2021 to repay the full amount owing, with instalment payments to begin 30 days or more after the plan is given by the landlord to the renter.

The province paid the rent supplement of up to $500 a month to 86,000 eligible households between April and August, and is taking applications for August up until the end of the month. As of September full rent must be paid or landlords may issue 10-day notice to end tenancy.

“As always, we encourage landlords to communicate with their tenant to avoid the need to end tenancy,” LandlordBC advises members on its website.

The B.C. government extended its ban on rent increases until the end of 2020, so tenants who have received a notice of rent increase can continue to pay their existing rent amount through December.

Statistics Canada says the consumer price index was up 0.1 per cent compared with a year ago, as gasoline prices were down nearly 15 per cent.

Excluding the drop in gasoline prices, the inflation barometer would have increased at an annual rate of 0.7 per cent, matching the same reading for June.

The average economist estimate had been for a year-over-year increase of 0.5 per cent for July, according to financial data firm Refinitiv.

The statistics agency says the slower pace of price growth was broad-based, spanning goods and services.

Statistics Canada says air travel prices fell in July by 8.6 per cent, the first year-over-year decline since December 2015.

It says the result was due to airlines offering incentives for people to travel again, including reduced fees, discounts and promotions even as many flights remained cancelled or suspended because of the pandemic.

(B.C. forests ministry photo.)

The B.C. government is carrying on its “wolf cull” for a fifth year, along with a hunter harvest of cow and calf moose to further reduce wolf populations in areas where caribou herds are beginning to recover from a long decline.

The B.C. wolf kill program has been credited for rebounds in shrinking mountain and boreal caribou populations, where some Kootenay herds have disappeared and the largest herds in the Peace region have started to recover after dwindling to a few hundred animals. And the latest protests have not been over shooting wolves from helicopters, but on the NDP government’s approval of game tags for up to 400 antlerless moose for the fall season in addition to bulls.

54 identified caribou herds in B.C. are intensively studied, with population falling even in parks and protected areas #bcpoli #bcleg pic.twitter.com/jia8hvYcZu — Tom Fletcher (@tomfletcherbc) September 18, 2019

The province has budgeted $1.2 million for caribou protection measures in the current fiscal year, Forests Minister Doug Donaldson said in debate on his ministry budget last week, and $500,000 of that is to pay for a fifth winter of wolf removal to protect caribou calves. For the Peace region herds, he said the efforts are paying off.

“The overall population in the central group right now is estimated at a little less than 300,” Donaldson said. “The historic levels were in the range of 2,000 animals. That would take a long time, to get to those numbers. Of course, the herd could become self-sustaining and also be able to provide Indigenous harvesting rights opportunities before that historic number is reached.”

Restoring the Peace herds is the aim of a sweeping land use agreement with the West Moberly and Saulteaux First Nations that was signed in January 2020. It adds two million acres to protected areas on northern B.C., developed amid protests that the forest industry and local governments were shut out as the federal government led talks.

RELATED: B.C. Interior moose population declines after fires

The B.C. government backed off from extending protected areas at the expense of logging and mining in the Cariboo and Kootenay regions, after Donaldson declared that predator control and maternity pens for caribou were turning around the decline.

The Peace region agreement focused on the central caribou group, including the Klinse-Za herd northwest of Chetwynd that was reduced to 16 animals by 2013. With pens to protect newborns, habitat restoration and wolf removal, the Klinse-Za population had recovered to 80 southern mountain caribou by 2020.

Declining moose populations in some regions have sparked protests about the province’s antlerless moose hunt, part of an effort to reduce wolf packs. Long-time hunter activist Dan Simmons has worked with numerous Indigenous communities who are concerned about moose populations affected by forest fires and hunting, petitioning the province to protect cow and calf moose.

The dynamics of big game in B.C. have been changing. The NDP government barred grizzly hunting for non-Indigenous people and resident hunting has shown signs of decline. Deer wander in rural yards and gardens as in urban neighbourhoods, and Peace River South MLA Mike Bernier has questioned Donaldson about farmers coping with a surge in elk damaging their crops.

The Canadian housing market saw more sales this July than any month in the past 40 years, with 30 per cent more homeowners closing on properties compared to this time last year.

The Canadian Real Estate Association said Monday that the 62,355 sales in July 2020 marked the highest monthly sales figure on record, with data going back more than 40 years.

Sales in July were up 30.5 per cent compared with the same month a year ago and up 26 per cent from June, rebounding from lows of earlier this year when the COVID-19 pandemic froze the market.

CREA Senior Economist Shaun Cathcart said there was more than one driving force behind July’s full-tilt housing market, citing both COVID-19 and existing issues heading into 2020.

“A big part of what we’re seeing right now is the snap back in activity that would have otherwise happened earlier this year,” Cathcart said.

“Recall that before the lockdowns, we were heading into the tightest spring market in almost 20 years.”

“Some purchases will no doubt be delayed, but the new-found importance of home, lack of a daily commute for many, a desire for more outdoor and personal space, room for a home office, etc. will certainly also spur activity that otherwise would not have happened in a non-COVID-19 world.”

CREA says the actual national average price for homes sold in July was a record $571,500, up 14.3 per cent from the same month last year.

The uptick in prices was broad-based, with all 20 of the markets tracked by CREA reporting month-over-month increases in July.

The Toronto area, Guelph, Ottawa and Montreal saw the biggest price spikes, with prices climbing faster in most markets east of Saskatchewan. Prices rose more modestly in British Columbia and Alberta, CREA said.

In July, demand outpaced supply, as sales increased faster than new properties could be listed. Although new listings hit a record for the month of July, as the number of newly listed homes climbed by 7.6 per cent in July compared with June, it came amid a 26 per cent jump in sales.

Cathcart said in a statement that despite the surge in new listings hitting the market, the total number of listings that lingered on the market as inventory was at a 16-year low.

CREA’s statement also suggested that new supply appears to be “tapering off in many parts of the country,” with the Toronto area dominating new listings. The “sales-to-new listings” ratio in July was at its highest levels since 2001-2002, at 73.9 per cent.

“There are listings that will come to the market because of COVID-19, but many properties are also not being listed right now due to the virus,” said Cathcart.

Brian DePratto, senior economist at TD Economics, said it can be hard to understand how the housing market can be so hot when the unemployment rate remains in double-digits.

“The pandemic has disproportionately impacted lower income Canadians, who are less likely to be or become homeowners,” wrote DePratto in a note to clients. “Borrowing costs have fallen.”

DePratto said that the strength of the recent rebound in the housing market is “definitely surprising” and said there are still many factors to watch in terms of tracking the economic recovery from the pandemic.

“A number of support programs, including mortgage forbearance, are helping insulate the economy from the worst impacts of the pandemic,” wrote DePratto.

“As autumn approaches, these programs will expire or change form. Depending on the progress of the broader economic recovery, this could bring significant headwinds to housing markets, particularly prices.”

Shaw Mobile will offer three levels of service plan — all with access to Shaw’s 450,000 wireless hotspots in Western Canada currently available to the company’s residential landline customers.

The posted prices on Shaw Mobile’s website range between $15 and $95 per month, with a one-time $20 connection fee for each line, but are currently subject to promotional discounts. In addition, new and existing Shaw internet customers will be eligible for up to six free lines.

Shaw, which operates Western Canada’s largest cable TV network, competes primarily against Telus Corp. in Alberta and B.C. Both companies offer a variety of telecom services including home internet and video, wireless phone service and business telecommunications.

Shaw’s existing Freedom Mobile service competes with Telus, Rogers and Bell in B.C., Alberta and Ontario.

The three big national carriers — which collectively have about 90 per cent of the country’s wireless market — each have three separate wireless brands, with Freedom mostly up against Telus’s Koodo, Rogers’s Fido and Bell’s Virgin.

Shaw was a late entrant into the mobile phone business in 2016, when it acquired the formerly independent Wind Mobile and its existing network in parts of Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia — three of Canada’s most populated provinces.

Prior to the Wind acquisition, Shaw had decided against making the heavy investments required to set up its own mobile network, which requires spectrum licences that are auctioned periodically by the federal government. Instead, it focused on building an extensive network of WiFi hotspots in public places.

WiFi communications don’t require federal licences, making it an affordable way for smartphone users to connect with their residential internet service or to outside WiFi services offered by retailers, libraries and telecom companies.

During a week of hearings before the CRTC in February, industry executives from all of Canada’s wireless companies said posted rates are one part of the pricing equation, given there are frequent short-term promotions that can be localized within regions and even within shopping malls.

The mid-range Shaw Mobile service plan has a regular posted price of $85 per month ($45 with the launch discount) that includes 25 gigabytes of data at full speed. There are a number of conditions attached that may affect customer decisions.

All three level of service include unlimited calls to Canada, as well as unlimited incoming calls, text, pictures and video messaging. The lowest-price plan charges extra for data in $10 increments.

More people are throwing plant-based burgers on the grill this summer.

Beyond Meat, which makes pea protein-based burgers and sausages, said Tuesday its second quarter revenue jumped 69% to $113 million as more households tried its products in the U.S. and elsewhere.

Sales far outpaced Wall Street’s forecast of $99 million, according to analysts polled by FactSet.

The El Segundo, California-based company reported a net loss of $10 million for the April-June period. Adjusted for one-time items, including coronavirus-related expenses, Beyond Meat lost 2 cents per share. That was in line with analysts’ expectations.

Normally, Beyond Meat sells half its output to restaurants and food service, Beyond Meat President and CEO Ethan Brown said. The company had to make a rapid pivot when those sales cratered this spring due to coronavirus-related closures.

Burgers and sausages that were packaged for food service were returned to factories and repackaged for consumers. In mid-June, for example, the company launched a 10-burger value pack for $15.99 at Walmart, Target and other groceries. Normally, two four-ounce patties cost $5.99.

As a result, Beyond Meat’s U.S. retail sales nearly doubled during the quarter, even as food service sales dropped 61%.

“It’s not a small exercise, when it’s physical goods, to make a change like that over a quarter,” Brown said. The company spent $5.9 million repackaging goods during the quarter.

Brown said that by June, 4.9% of U.S. households had tried Beyond Meat products, up from 3.5% in January. More important, half of those who bought Beyond products bought them again, up from 45% in January, Brown said.

International retail sales were up 167%. Brown said Beyond Meat is now sold in 84 countries, up from 51 a year ago. International food-service sales, however, dropped 56.5%.

Beyond Meat continued to invest in international expansion during the quarter. In June, it opened a manufacturing facility in the Netherlands with its Dutch partner, Zandbergen. Brown said Beyond Meat also plans to start production in China by the end of this year.

“We believe the magnitude of the opportunity in Asia merits significant investment,” Brown said.

In April, Beyond Meat debuted in at Starbucks, which sells the company’s imitation beef in lasagna, pasta and a spicy wrap. Brown said Beyond Meat products were also offered for a limited time at Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC restaurants in China through a partnership with their parent company, Yum Brands.

KFC is also testing a Beyond Meat chicken nugget in the U.S.

Beyond Meat declined to give forward-looking financial guidance, citing the pandemic.

It shares rose 6% to close at $142.25 Tuesday. But they fell 7.5% in after-hours trading following the release of the earnings report.

The agency says nearly 30 per cent of people working less than 30 hours a week in July would have preferred full-time work, an increase from the 22.2 per cent recorded one year earlier.

Canada’s labour market gained 419,000 jobs last month as more parts of the economy were allowed to reopen, Statistics Canada reported Friday, moving past the halfway mark in recouping heavy losses at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The national unemployment rate was 10.9 per cent in July, down from the 12.3 per cent recorded in June and sliding further away from the record-high 13.7 per cent in May.

But underneath the figures there was new data about the unequal impact of the historic shifts in the workforce as the statistics agency reported that rates were well above average for racialized workers.

South Asian, Arab and Black workers had seasonally unadjusted unemployment rates of 17 per cent or more, with rates even higher for women than men, compared with a rate of 9.3 per cent for people not designated a visible minority or identified as Indigenous.

Statistics Canada says the higher rates for racialized workers could be linked, in part, to their greater numbers in some of the industries hardest hit by pandemic-related shutdowns, such as accommodation and food services where employment dropped by more than half over March and April.

The details mark the first time the agency’s monthly labour force survey has captured disaggregated data by race and visible minority status, putting numbers to the narrative about disproportionate impacts on women, youth, low-wage workers, and racialized communities.

The overall figures were slightly better than expected, with the average economist estimate for a gain of 400,000 jobs in July and an unemployment rate of 11 per cent, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.

Combined with the 953,000 jobs gained in June and the 290,000 in May, the country was within 1.3 million jobs of the pre-pandemic level. About three million jobs were lost over March and April.

“The pace of increase in employment slowed in July relative to the prior month, and that’s likely to become a trend as the pace of easing in restrictions also slows down and the number of Canadians on temporary layoff falls,” CIBC senior economist Royce Mendes wrote in a note.

“The good news is that with virus cases low in Canada at moment, the country isn’t facing an immediate risk of having to tamp down activity again.”

Most employment gains in July were in part-time work, which increased to the tune of 345,000 positions, while full-time positions increased by 73,000.

Part-time gains have outpaced full-time work in each of the past three months, Statistics Canada noted, with part-time work within five per cent of its pre-COVID-19 levels compared with full-time work, which is still down 7.5 per cent from February before the pandemic struck.

The agency says nearly 30 per cent of people working less than 30 hours a week in July would have preferred full-time work, an increase from the 22.2 per cent recorded one year earlier.

Statistics Canada says the finding suggests that employers, at least for now, may be limiting the number of hours being offered even as restrictions ease.

About 266,0000 more people were looking for work in July, the third consecutive month of gains, but that’s still down almost 300,000 from where it was in February.

The agency says the unemployment rate would have been 13.8 per cent in July if it had included in calculations those who wanted to work but didn’t look for a job.

Honda Canada is recalling 53,770 vehicles for repair.

The recall in Canada covers 2018 to 2020 Honda Odysseys, 2019 to 2020 Honda Passports and 2019 to 2021 Honda Pilots.

The automaker says that depending on the vans or SUV, it may need one or more of four free repairs, including two software updates, replacement of rear view camera and replacement of sliding door outer handle cables.

There have been no reports of crashes or injuries associated with the voluntary recall, said Honda spokeswoman Laura Heasman.

The recall comes after Honda recalled 1.6 million vehicles in the U.S., citing faulty software that can stop the display of the speedometer, engine oil lights, gear positions and rear cameras.

In Odyssey minivans, water can enter the door handle cables and freeze, preventing the doors from latching, and water can also distort the rear-view camera.

British Columbians will now be allowed to pick-up their online cannabis purchases in store, instead of just reserving it, to limit how much time customers spend inside stores during the pandemic.

In a Tuesday (Aug. 4) news release, the province said the move came after requests from private cannabis retailers, which have popped up in many B.C. cities since pot was legalized in late 2018.

Previously, customers could reserve product online but would have to complete the purchase in store. Now, only the age-verification step must be done in store.

Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth said that online sales will help legal retailers to “increase competitiveness with the illegal market.”

Stores that sell cannabis can now also offer gift cards that can be used at all of that retailer’s locations, not just the one it was purchased at.

On a total CERB payment of $12,000, about $1,800 would be owing to Ottawa.
But operational losses can be applied against taxable income for the past three years, which could result in a tax refund.","Canada Emergency Response Benefit provides workers who lost their jobs or most of their hours with $500 per week

Many Canadians are just trying to get through the week, never mind the year, when it comes to their finances.

But accountants say it’s already time to start taking stock of government support and wages received since the COVID-19 pandemic struck.

Launched in March, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit provides workers who lost their jobs or most of their hours with $500 per week. Most employers deduct taxes from the paycheque before mailing it out, but that’s not the case with the CERB.

“My first piece of advice is people should be aware these are taxable benefits,” said Fred O’Riordan, national tax policy leader at Ernst & Young. “Ultimately they are going to be responsible for having received them and for declaring them.”

That means Ottawa and the provinces will claw back some of the $61.3 billion in CERB paid to 8.4 million Canadians as of July 19.

It also means recipients who took in the full amount available from the CERB — $12,000, at $500 per week between March 15 and Oct. 3 for up to 12 weeks — could owe taxes to the Canada Revenue Agency if they had even a small amount of other paid work this year.

Anyone who qualifies for the CERB but earns less than the “basic personal amount,” which Ottawa is raising to $13,229 from $12,069 for 2020 — does not have to pay tax, including on their CERB instalments.

Incomes under $48,536 but above the basic personal amount will be taxed at 15 per cent — the lowest income tax rate for 2020 — including CERB payments. On a total CERB payment of $12,000, about $1,800 would be owing to Ottawa.

“Obviously if you’re in receipt of this money, you’re in some financial pain already. And it’s not easy to save up money to make sure that if there’s tax owing when you file next that you’re in a position to pay it,” said O’Riordan.

He emphasized the need to start planning now, particularly as the provinces plan to retrieve their cut as well.

In Ontario and British Columbia, a taxpayer earning less than $44,741 or $41,725 respectively will owe the province about $600 on a $12,000 benefit. Albertans earning under $131,220 would owe $1,200 while low-income Quebecers would have to pay $1,800.

Canadians out of a job due to the pandemic and who made less than $1,000 per month at any point since mid-March qualify for a CERB payment (provided they made at least $5,000 last year), but if earnings crossed that monthly threshold without their realizing or declaring it, they may have received CERB monies they were not eligible for.

“There really weren’t many controls at the front of this. Generally, people who have applied have received it.,” O’Riordan said.

“Some people will be tempted if they’ve received money that they don’t qualify for to sort of play the lottery game. But I would never recommend that, because it’s pretty simple for the agency, through its algorithms, to determine whether people are eligible or not.”

O’Riordan suggested informing the CRA of any extra payments before Dec. 31.

For those concerned about not being able to pay their taxes, experts recommend contacting the CRA to work out a payment plan.

“You might be in a lower tax bracket now … so it’s important to do those estimates to know how much you need to set aside,” said Joseph Micallef, a tax partner at KPMG based in Toronto.

On the other hand, Canadians who have lost out on expected income for part of the year may be eligible for child credits or GST/HST credits they would not have qualified for previously.

Another option is to plan for a deduction based on RRSP contributions, but the deferred tax would likely not amount to much, said Montreal-based tax specialist Omar Yassine.

“In my opinion, if a taxpayer has seen their income decrease significantly due to COVID-19 they should not use part of the unused RRSP contributions for 2020.”

Small business owners who have permanently closed shop still have tax obligations and must file in April for 2020-21, Yassine noted. But operational losses can be applied against taxable income for the past three years, which could result in a tax refund.

Business owners who have filed for bankruptcy should consult accountants or tax specialists, he said.

The Canada Emergency Student Benefit, available to post-secondary students and recent graduates of high school, college and university, is also taxable, but deductibles and credits for tuition, textbook and moving living expenses can significantly reduce taxable income.

On Monday, the CRA further extended the payment due date for 2019 tax returns to Sept. 30 from Sept. 1, 2020.

A survey done by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) found that more than 21,000 small businesses in B.C. are at risk of closing.

These numbers don’t include businesses that have already closed due to COVID-19.

The CFIB has set up a website that tracks small businesses’ recovery throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. According to their data, in B.C. only 64 per cent of small businesses are fully open, only 32 per cent of fully staffed, and just 27 per cent are recording normal sales.

The survey, completed by over 5,000 CFIB members, also showed that one in seven small businesses in Canada are at risk of going under. That’s 14 per cent of all small and medium businesses.

“Small businesses are big players in our economy, so minimizing business losses is critical to recovery,” said Laura Jones, executive vice-president at CFIB.

“Right now both government support and consumer behaviour are critical to transitioning back to conditions that allow businesses to survive and thrive.”

CFIB estimates that business closures in B.C. due to COVID-19 will range from the low end of 6,395 (4 per cent), to the high-end estimate of 28,920 (16 per cent). A medium range for this estimate is shows that over 21,116 (12 per cent) are at risk.

While CFIB said that they haven’t analyzed the breakdown between rural and urban small businesses, they say that business sectors have been a bigger factor in how well a business is currently doing.

“In sectors like hospitality, those regions will be harder hit, compared to sectors like agriculture and construction,” said Jones. “That’s been a bigger factor than geography.”

Jones and the CFIB know that business closures are inevitable. Their hope and goal is that government can help bring those closures to the lower range of the CFIB’s estimates.

Jones added that while some government support has been useful to businesses, there’s a key section of their recovery plan being left out – rent.

“One in three businesses are saying that rent support is missing,” said Jones.

While government support will be key in recovery for small and medium-sized businesses, consumers will play a large role in helping keep these establishments open.

“There’s been a lot of shopping that’s shifted to larger businesses like Walmart and Amazon,” said Jones. “We’d really like for that to shift back and for consumers to support their local small businesses.”

The methodology for the study shows a margin of error of plus or minus 1.3 per cent, 19 times out of 20.

By Martha Perkins, Local Journalism Initiative Reporter, North Shore News

What a difference a cloud can make.

On a grey, wet day, Lori Daniels can stand outside her North Vancouver house, look out at the nearby mountains and marvel at their beauty.

On a hot, sunny day — especially if it comes in the midst of a string of hot, sunny days —, she looks at those mountains with wariness. What would happen if the campfire that some young people started over the weekend wasn’t fully extinguished? What if smouldering coals cause a tree to ignite and the wind picks up a burning ember, dropping it on the roof of her house?

As a professor of forest ecology and fire ecology at the University of British Columbia, those aren’t esoteric questions for Daniels. She knows the science and, as a person living near a forest, she knows that she can’t soothe her anxieties by saying “This will never happen to me.”

“I’m sitting in my backyard now,” she says during a telephone interview on an overcast afternoon. “I’ve just come out of Hunter Park which, after the rain, was quite moist so the fire danger is low. But if you had talked to me three days ago, in the middle of our little hot, dry spell, the fire danger was absolutely much higher, even here in out coastal temperate rainforest.

“We like to think that there’s not much fire danger here but, in truth, we know that in the summertime we live in a dry, hot climate. Although this year has been a little bit cooler and wet, if we look over the last five years we’ve had some of the biggest fire seasons in coastal regions in the last century…. We are not immune.”

Daniels is grateful for the leadership role that the District of North Vancouver is playing with its FireSmart program, as well as its implementation of FireSmart protocols in its building and renovation codes. She says the district is showing leadership by being proactive.

However, much of the responsibility for keeping homes safe — as well as protecting the lives of firefighters — falls on individual homeowners.

Her family has already done a lot to mitigate the risk of their house catching on fire and while she understands why others might be tempted to procrastinate, she wants to amplify the district’s message: the risk is real.

Human nature is often reactive. When our roof leaks during a rainstorm, we remember to get it fixed. When the number of coronavirus cases climb, we remember to wear a face mask. When we see smoke, we remember that we were supposed to remove all those dead branches from our roof.

You can still hope for the best but it’s better to also plan for the worst.

“FireSmart doesn’t guarantee that your home is never going to experience a fire but it sure gives you a better chance of having your house survive that fire. And, perhaps more importantly, it creates a safe space if wildland firefighters have to go into your yard and defend your home,” Daniels says. “One, you have a better chance that they’ll save your house and, two, you’re not putting their life at risk.”

South of the border and in regions where forest fires have become a more constant threat, home insurance costs have been known to triple. Sometimes you can’t even get insurance if you live or build in a fire-prone area. Future fires on the North Shore could create similar pressures here. It’s therefore financially more prudent to invest in some FireSmart initiatives now — it can be as simple as cutting back branches and being vigilant about clearing debris — than risk higher insurance premiums later.

Daniels says we are seeing the impact of climate change.

“Our hot, dry summers do put us at risk,” she says. “From a fire ecology and fire management perspective, .125the coastal fires of.375 2015 was like turning on the light switch for all of us. Then, in 2017 there was an early fire season. We broke 85 high temperature records in one summer whether we were on Vancouver Island, the southern interior, the northern interior or on the coast. We had extreme weather conditions that exceeded anything in the instrumental records for more than 100 years.

“And that’s part of a pattern. When we look over the long term, temperatures are creeping up in the winter and summer routinely has greater droughts. This year and last year were wetter as part of our natural variation from year to year, but the overarching trend is still towards hotter and drier.”

Imagine a rollercoaster, she says. On the West Coast’s weather rollercoaster, “the ups are getting a little bit higher and the downs aren’t going as low as they usually do. So instead of the rollercoaster starting and ending at the same point, this rollercoaster starts and ends a little bit higher than it did before.”

“I don’t think we would have talked about this in 2010,” Daniels says. “Now we know it’s something that we need to be aware of and it’s simply a shift in the way that we’re understanding, experiencing and responding to wildfire.”

So, in these waning days of summer, when the hot is not too hot to work outdoors, and the cold is not too cold to let everyone forget forest fires are a risk even on the North Shore, Daniels encourages everyone to practise a little preventative yardwork. Clean your roof, prune those trees and start imagining what might happen if a burning ember was to waft onto your property.

The government of Nunavut is affirming its intention to create a civilian police oversight body after a recent review of a shooting death of an Inuit man. Territorial Justice Minister Jeannie Ehaloak says it’s a priority for her government to stop relying on other police forces to investigate actions of the RCMP. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick

Nunavut is preparing legislation to create a civilian police review agency after a recent review of a shooting death of an Inuit man released almost no information about what happened.

“We are actively discussing partnerships with civilian lead investigative bodies and will soon bring forward the legislative changes required to ensure a civilian body has full statutory authority to conduct investigations in the territory,” territorial Justice Minister Jeannie Ehaloak said in an email.

Ehaloak, who has said before that she supports civilian reviews, made the promise after the Ottawa Police Service released results of an investigation into the shooting death of Attachie Ashoona in Kinngait, Nunavut, on Feb. 27.

Investigators found officers “did not exceed the use of force necessary to control the situation.”

No information on the circumstances was released. Ottawa police said they interviewed five RCMP officers and 10 people from the community, but there was silence on what Ashoona was doing or why the officers fired their guns.

Ashoona’s name wasn’t released until this week.

“They’re doing what the current system currently allows,” said Benson Cowan, head of Nunavut’s legal aid society. “All it does is erode trust in the institutions that are so important.”

Kinngait Mayor Timoon Toonoo confirmed council hadn’t received any information on the investigation.

“We haven’t got anything,” he said.

Cowan said the review may have been thorough and complete. But nobody except the investigators knows that.

“I don’t think anyone would look at this and say this would build trust.”

Trust between Inuit and RCMP has been an issue for a long time.

“Nunavummiut have expressed the desire to move away from police- led investigations into serious incidents involving members of the RCMP V Division,” Ehaloak said.

Northern media report there are at least six current investigations into RCMP behaviour. Several Arctic politicians have called for body cameras on Mounties.

In June, video showed an apparently intoxicated Inuit man being knocked over by the door of a slowly moving police vehicle before he was arrested. He was taken to the detachment lockup where he was badly beaten by a fellow prisoner. The man was never charged.

There are historic grievances as well. The force has been criticized for its role in ushering Inuit into communities and killing sled dogs that would have allowed them to leave.

Nunavut RCMP were not available for comment.

New Democrat Nunavut MP Mumilaaq Qaqqaq said civilian oversight of police would be a good thing, but wouldn’t address why so many Inuit get into trouble in the first place.

“Where do we see violence? Where do we see crime? We see that where there is poverty.

“We see that in Nunavut because of the lack of basic human needs being met.”

She urged Ehaloak to look at other solutions to policing problems in Nunavut, pointing to Indigenous police services in other parts of Canada.

Qaqqaq said the federal government needs to step up to ease ills such as poor housing behind many of Nunavut’s social and criminal problems.

“The federal government is doing less than the bare minimum for Inuit people,” she said.

Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth announced the new fine authority Aug. 21, after the province’s coronavirus infection rate jumped in recent weeks to as many as 100 cases a day. Public health officials say the majority of the new cases have been identified through contact tracing after summer parties and gatherings.

Owners and organizers can be fined for having more than five guests at a vacation rental, or failing to keep a contact list of people who have attended. For public gatherings, witnesses are advised to contact their local government bylaw office, or the local police non-emergency line to report violations.

“Just because your party has less than 50 people does not make it legal,” Farnworth said.

Fines of $200 will be imposed on people who are not hosts or organizers but encourage people to violate public health orders, or are abusive to people attempting to follow physical distance rules. In addition to police, conservation officers, liquor and cannabis inspectors, bylaw officers and WorkSafeBC inspectors are empowered to issue tickets.

“Don’t yell at the waiter who asks you not to push your tables together at a restaurant,” Farnworth said. Enforcement will target “large house parties, unsanctioned events on our streets, on our beaches. Enough is enough.”

RELATED: B.C. reaches 200 deaths, 80 new cases on Thursday

Farnworth emphasized that the enforcement is aimed at a small minority of people who put others at risk.

“If violation tickets do not act as a deterrent, or in cases of particularly egregious contraventions or for repeat offences, police can recommend charges in relation to the offence,” the ministry said in a statement. “On conviction, judicial penalties of up to $10,000 may be levied.”

The measure was endorsed by B.C.’s Alliance of Beverage Licensees, after public health restrictions were eased this summer to allow pubs and restaurants to operate with space restrictions.

Conservative Party of Canada","O’Toole has already spoken to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, where western alienation was a topic he brought up

Conservative Party of Canada Leader Erin O’Toole speaks after his win at the 2020 Leadership Election, in Ottawa on Sunday, Aug. 23, 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick

Newly elected Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole said Tuesday that as leader, and as a prime minister, he will stand up for the rights of women and the LGBTQ community, and he intends to apply that fighting spirit to all his files.

His comments came in his first news conference after winning the race early Monday morning, a victory owed in part to thousands of supporters of avowed social conservative candidates. Those party members backed O’Toole as their third choice, after he promised to always respect their concerns.

The Liberals wasted little time accusing him of being in the pocket of that constituency, suggesting Tuesday he’s going to have to prove that’s not the case by kicking one of those candidates — Ontario MP Derek Sloan — out of caucus.

During the race, Sloan had spoken aggressively about the chief public health officer, as well as abortion and LGBTQ conversion therapy. The language he used to discuss those issues was widely condemned as being racist and bigoted, which he denies.

O’Toole appeared to chalk Sloan’s rhetoric up to a heated leadership race, and said he is part of a united team.

No one should buy the Liberal spin, he said.

“I won the leadership of the Conservative party as a pro-choice Conservative MP, one that won with a strong mandate,” he said.

“That’s how I’m going to lead as the leader of the Opposition and that’s how I’ll be as prime minister. I’m in politics to defend the rights of Canadians to secure a brighter future.”

In remarks to his supporters posted to social media, Sloan said he intends to remain a member of the caucus. He also vowed not to give up.

“I will always stand up for the principles and the values that I ran on in this campaign and I won’t back down,” he said.

“I’ll be sure to share my views with the new leader and I’m confident he’ll listen.”

It’s time to grow our team. Are you with me? 👍 pic.twitter.com/CAv5gPqLLb — Erin O'Toole (@ErinOTooleMP) August 24, 2020

O’Toole was also set to speak Tuesday with his two other challengers in the race, Leslyn Lewis and Peter MacKay.

Reaching out to them, and their supporters, is part of building his team to both guide the party in the House of Commons, but also in the next campaign.

Lewis will run as Conservative candidate in the next election.

The party will be ready for the next campaign whenever it comes, O’Toole said.

But he doesn’t necessarily intend to be the one to force an election in the confidence vote that will take place after the Liberals’ speech from the throne next month.

“I’m here to fight for the well-being of Canadians across the country and for better solutions, faster responses and excellence in government, and ethical government,” he said.

“We will assess the government going forward on all those criteria.”

O’Toole has already spoken to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, where western alienation was a topic he brought up off the top. The issue is of primary concern to Conservatives in the West who are watching O’Toole closely on the file.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, who had endorsed O’Toole, said Tuesday he also spoke with him for half an hour.

He said O’Toole has proven in the past he’s an ally for the West and will do so in the future, pointing to a commitment in O’Toole’s platform for legislation specifically to encourage the building of oil pipelines.

“I have great confidence in his ability, his wisdom, and his total dedication for fairness for Alberta and a strong future for our resource industries.”

O’Toole also intends to meet personally with Quebec Premier Francois Legault in the coming days. Shoring up support in that province is a perennial issue for the party.

Among the leadership contenders, O’Toole handily won Quebec and on Tuesday, named former Quebec MP Alupa Clarke, who chaired his campaign in that province, as a special adviser.

Fred DeLorey, who ran O’Toole’s campaign overall, has also been named the manager of the next national election campaign.

The party also has a new executive director. It has also decided to no longer apply for the federal wage subsidy program. Its earlier choice to do so had been widely criticized by some grassroots members who felt it inappropriate for a political organization to be using the COVID-19 support program.

The leadership race was all about testing the preferences of the party’s grassroots and O’Toole’s task now is to read the tea leaves to figure out the path forward.

A strong signal was also sent by those who backed Lewis.

Lewis entered the campaign a relative unknown, but her efforts gained enough traction to see her finish with a strong third-place showing.

One element that helped propel Lewis forward was the fact she was clear on her social conservative views, and what she would do about it if she had won.

Former leader Andrew Scheer had faltered on that score on the campaign trail and it cost the party in the last federal election.

When asked Tuesday how else he’d be different from Scheer, O’Toole was blunt.

“I have a track record of serving Canada and getting things done,” he said.

“That’s why I’m not famous, I’m not well known. I get things done, I don’t drop the ball.”

The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on Wednesday, March 11, 2020. (The Canadian Press)

As COVID-19 continues to spread, health officials are urging British Columbians to ensure they take the proper steps to get tested while also not spreading the virus to others.

“Now is the time to put some distance between us to keep our germs to ourselves,” provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said earlier this week, reiterating crucial steps of prevention she has noted since mid-February.

The virus has spread rapidly in B.C. over the past few weeks. There have been at least 46 cases and one death. Globally, there have been more than 118,00 confirmed cases and 4,300 deaths, the majority of them in China, Italy and Iran.

That includes at least four cases of community transmission, which means it remains unclear how those cases were contracted but were not from travelling.

So how do you know if you have the novel coronavirus? How can you tell if it is COVID-19 and not the flu or cold? And most importantly: What do you do if you are, in fact, infected?

Symptoms of COVID-19:

The symptoms of the novel coronavirus are similar to a common cold or flu, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.

That includes a fever and cough but most importantly difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. In severe cases, symptoms can include severe lung infections.

Health officials have warned that it can take up to 14 days, or two weeks, for symptoms to appear and can range from mild to severe. Seniors and those with underlying medical conditions are most at-risk of seeing adverse impacts if they contract the virus.

Out of precaution, health officials have made it clear: if you feel sick, stay home.

""Now is the time to put some distance between us to keep our germs to ourselves,"" Henry says. #COVIDー19 — Ashley Wadhwani (@ashwadhwani) March 7, 2020

The B.C. government has now added an online assesment tool for those who think they may have the disease, and what steps they need to take based off their symptoms.

How the virus spreads:

Coronavirus is transmitted through larger liquid droplets – such as when a person coughs or sneezes. That means the virus can enter a second person’s system through their eyes, nose or throat if in close contact.

While the virus is not known to be airborne, or transmitted through the particles floating in the air, and it is not something that comes in through the skin, it can be spread by touch if a person has used their hands to cover their mouth or nose when they cough.

Health officials recommend to always cough or sneeze into the arm and wash your hands regularly. People should also avoid handshaking and hugs.

A good rule of thumb: Stay at least six feet away from another person.‎

How to get tested:

Anyone who thinks they may have the virus is being urged not to panic, and most importantly to stay home.

Anyone in B.C. who develops symptoms should first call HealthLink BC, by dialing 811, to talk to a health care worker and determine the most appropriate next steps.

The nurses at HealthLink BC will complete an exposure risk assessment of callers with compatible symptoms, such as cough or influenza-like symptoms. In some cases, nurses may suggest a caller go see a health care provider for assessment and testing, either at an urgent primary care centre or walk-in clinic.

Our 811 navigators and nurses are doing an incredible job with record high call volumes – providing support to 3291 callers yesterday. We are adding more staff and more phone lines to resolve the intermittent busy signals some people have experienced. @TeamPAL #COVID19 — Adrian Dix (@adriandix) March 12, 2020

It is highly recommend that anyone who may have COVID-19 call ahead to tell the clinicians that they are coming.

COVID-19 testing is done through a nasopharyngeal swab or throat swab.

Anyone who is tested may be told to self-isolate until the tests can be analyzed in a laboratory. Test results can be found by calling the B.C. Centre for Disease Control coronavirus hotline at 1-833-707-2792.

What happens if you have COVID-19:

Anyone with COVID-19 is being placed in quarantine, at their home or in the hospital, for at least 14 days. In order to be released from quarantine, an infected person must have two consecutive negative tests at least 24 hours apart.

The BC CDC suggests that if you are sharing your home to stay and sleep in a room with good airflow that is away from others. Other precautions include using a separate bathroom, if you can, avoid sharing household items, flush the toilet with the lid down, and clean and disinfect common areas once a day.

Is there a cure?

At this time, there is no vaccine for this particular coronavirus, and health officials say it could take many years to create.

There is no specific treatment, but many of the symptoms can be managed with home treatment such as drinking plenty of fluids, rest and using a humidifier or hot shower to ease a cough or sore throat, according to HealthLink BC.

Most people recover from coronaviruses on their own, however for people with more serious illness, supportive care in or out of hospital may be needed.

With new novel Coronavirus cases emerging all over the world, health officials are urging residents to take precautionary measures to prevent more individuals from getting sick.

Canadian health officials are urging people to wash their hands frequently, with soap, for at least 20 seconds at a time and avoid touching their face or other people.

Handshakes and embraces should also be avoided.

“Wash our hands, stay home when you’re sick, stay home from school, stay home from public events, stay home from visiting people in long term health [facilities] and hospitals,” Health Minister Adrian Dix said at a news conference in early March.

Were you looking forward to a vacation this spring but are now worried about the COVID-19 pandemic?

Canada is under a global travel advisory due to the novel coronavirus. Canadians are being urged to avoid non-essential travel and Transport Canada is warning that repatriation flights are not currently being operated, which could leave those who choose to go abroad stranded.

For hotel stays and airlines outside of Canada, check with your airline, your hotel or your travel agent for their cancellation policies. Some travel insurance is continuing to cover COVID-19 but many providers are not, deeming it a “known circumstance,” which is typically excluded from coverage. Trip cancellation insurance may be an option for those who booked before news of COVID-19 broke.

All air passengers are required to wear masks, although some airlines have removed or relaxed physical distancing requirements on board.

As health officials work to sort out the particulars around what specific industries and sectors will need to do in order to re-open safely, British Columbians have been given a high-level road map as to what will relaunch, and when.

Led by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, the multi-phase plan which has been dubbed “the new normal” will rely on whether B.C. sees a required decrease in the number of new daily COVID-19 cases.

As long as British Columbians don’t let up on the basics – frequently washing hands, practising physical distancing, avoiding any non-essential trips, staying home when sick, and taking a careful approach to broadening social circles beyond those currently in their household – there has been much hope voiced by health officials that there could be overnight camping, movie theatres and other social activities returning in coming months.

“We need to have a slow and thoughtful reset, we do not want to undo all that we have done,” Henry said on Thursday (May 7).

ALSO READ: Here’s what is considered an essential service in B.C.

The plan to re-open parts of B.C., curated by Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix, will meet its first test in a few weeks, as the province moves to “Phase Two” with the re-opening of libraries, in-person counselling, restaurants and more.

Henry has made it clear that bans will be reintroduced if she sees a resurgence in cases.

Here’s a timeline of how the province plans to phase in various services.

Phase Two, mid-May:

Re-scheduling elective surgeries and other health services

Dix announced this week that health authorities have already started calling patients who were forced to reschedule an elective surgery due to hospital restrictions and so bed space remained open in case of a spike in COVID-19 cases.

Meanwhile, other medical services such as dentistry, physiotherapy, registered massage therapy and chiropractors will also be able to safely re-open. This includes physical therapy, speech therapy and similar services.

In-person counselling will also be able to resume under physical distancing protocols.

Hair salons and personal services

Welcome news for most: Salons, barber shops and other personal service establishments will be able to accept clients. The decision by health officials comes despite a growing petition signed by some stylists and barbers asking the province not to “single them out” by opening first.

Restaurants, cafes and pubs

In late April, a group of restaurateurs were asked to create a proposed plan on how the industry could re-open safely. Since mid-March, restaurants and pubs of all sizes have been operating only as take-out and delivery services due to concerns of physical distancing.

A possible blueprint, created by the BC Restaurant and Foodservices Association, on how businesses will have to adjust floor plans, seating arrangements and even the handling of cash, is currently before WorkSafeBC, which will be the final green light before dine-in options can return.

Henry has said that ensuring public trust is a second piece in the puzzle. The proposed plan includes a course that business owners and employees will have to undergo, and if passed, get to place a sticker on their front window.

Recreation and community spaces

Phase Two is also set to include the re-opening of museums, art galleries and libraries, as well as recreation spaces.

Parks, beaches and outdoor sites can also open. As with all other sites, physical distancing must be possible, as well as places to properly wash hands. In some cases, this could mean a cap on the number of visitors at any given time.

Health officials have OK’d some non-contact sports, such as soccer and lacrosse.

B.C. Parks has announced some trails will re-open to day use on May 14, with camping reservations to relaunch on May 25 through the Discover Camping online portal.

Office work spaces

Returning to the office will be likely for many British Columbians, but will have to be under measures that reduce the density of employees within certain areas.

Health officials have suggested that employers may stagger shifts, place physical barriers in between desks and space, and ensure hand sanitizer is available for staff.

All employers should have sick-day policies in place so employees don’t attend work when ill, and consider providing work from home options when possible, to reduce contact intensity.

Child care and education

As parents and caregivers prepare to return to work, the province is anticipating an increased need in child care support.

Child care has been considered an essential service, meaning that was not forced to close down like other businesses. Officials have said that in-classroom education will involve its own set of phases – yet to be released – that will allow kids back in the classroom before others.

“With weeks left in the school year, we anticipate many kids will not return to the classroom until September,” the province confirmed.

Phase Three, June to September

If transmission rates of COVID-19 remain low or in decline, Henry has said that further restrictions will be eased under enhanced measures.

While large-scale events, such as parades or mass gatherings will remain off the table through the summer and possibly into next year, the province is hopeful that British Columbians will be able to go to the movies again, starting in July.

Hotels and resorts

The hotel industry has been hard-hit due to a decrease in overall travel both inter-provincially and internationally, forcing many to shutter.

In Victoria and Vancouver, some have entered agreements with the province to serve as temporary housing for hundreds of homeless people currently living in three large encampments.

Exactly what protocols will be put in place in order for hotels and resorts to open safely have not been released, but will likely involve enhanced cleaning and limited guests. The World Health Organization and Henry have suggested that the bacterium does not live on surfaces for longer than hours to days, but specifics have not been confirmed by researchers.

Camping

Overnight camping will be available across B.C.’s parks beginning June 1. Meanwhile, some private campgrounds have remained open through the pandemic.

Film industry

It’s no surprise that Hollywood North has suffered due to border closures and physical distancing measures. Filming across B.C. tends to pick up in the spring and summer, specifically for Hallmark Christmas movies.

Health officials hope that in June or July that domestic productions will be able to resume.

Entertainment

In July, British Columbians may be allowed to head to the movies or attend a symphony, so long as transmission rates stay low.

While large concerts and festivals are off the table, movie theatres and smaller venues will have to follow current bans on gatherings being less than 50 people. Physical distancing also calls for at least two metres between individuals or strangers.

Education

The next school year will still be feeling the impacts of COVID-19, according to B.C.’s plan.

In September, Kindergarten to Grade 12 students will see a “partial return” to school. It’s too soon to say exactly what that will look like.

Post-secondary students could see a mix of online and in-class lectures, with a likely cap on attendance in larger-sized classrooms.

Phase Four, to be determined

It’s unclear when B.C. will enter Phase Four of the provincial plan, because it relies on the development of a widely available vaccine – which has yet to be created – the province reaching herd immunity, or a broad successful treatment that can manage COVID-19 symptoms.

Henry has said that B.C.’s goal is not to reach herd immunity because too many people, particularly seniors, run the risk of seeing adverse impacts of the virus and high numbers of cases would place too much pressure on the health care system.

The BC Centre for Disease Control has warned it could take years for a vaccine to be developed, tested and widely implemented.

However, when that does come, B.C. health officials will look to allowing conventions, live audiences at professional sports, concerts, night clubs and casinos and international tourism. Those sectors will also have to create individually tailored plans that meet the necessary health requirements.

A crowdfunding campaign has been launched to support a Nanaimo bar and music venue struggling due to COVID-19.

Not long after the Nanaimo Bar pub celebrated its fourth anniversary, COVID-19 restrictions were put in place, forcing owner and operator Sonia Komen to temporarily shut down her business. Since reopening, she said it feels like she’s “starting from zero.”

The biggest challenge she’s facing is paying her annual insurance bill, which she said quadrupled from $12,500 to $50,000 due to the pandemic.

“I might have to close doors because I can’t afford that,” Komen said.

Making matters worse, Komen said she’s had difficulty accessing the federal wage subsidy and in a Facebook post she said new regulations require her to close at 11 p.m., which is particularly costly as 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. is “prime time” for her.

When Nanaimo musicians David Bitonti and Carl Schleppe heard that the Nanaimo Bar was at risk of closing down, they sprung into action. Last week they set up a GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign to help keep the bar in business.

“I have a problem asking for help and I refuse to do it so it’s nice somebody else is doing it for me,” Komen said.

Bitonti said he and Schleppe perform at the Nanaimo Bar often and it’s venues like that that “truly make a community happen.”

“Nanaimo’s kind of a bigger city but it’s definitely got a small-town feel when it comes to the music community and so I just think it’s hugely valuable to have venues like hers that care about live music,” Bitonti said.

At first the campaign sought to raise $5,000, which Komen said could help get her through the month. In only four days that goal was met and exceeded by nearly $2,000. The fundraiser’s revised target is now $50,000, enough to cover the yearly cost of insurance.

Bitonti said he was “very pleased and excited and completely overwhelmed” to see the initial fundraiser meet its goal in less than a week. Komen said it was humbling to see the community response and she’s “in shock still.”

“I feel honoured that people are wanting to support the bar so much. The support is unreal…” she said. “I love this community. That’s one thing about Nanaimo is when somebody is in need of help, this community really pulls through every time.”

This year’s Gabriola Island Thanksgiving Studio Tour has been cancelled, but thanks to a $40,000 grant, guests are still welcome to a virtual visit.

The Gabriola Arts Council announced in a press release that while the 24th edition of the annual studio tour won’t be taking place, a website called The Arts on Gabriola is being put together that will feature 360-degree views of artists’ studios that guests can view from their own homes.

GAC executive director Carol Fergusson said the website is possible due to a $40,000 grant form the Vancouver Foundation’s community relief fund for rural arts organizations. Fergusson applied for the grant as soon as she became executive director in the spring, as she was already worried that the tour might have to be cancelled. It was the first grant application she ever wrote but she said it was a passionate plea “straight from my heart.”

“After I had finished writing it I told the board what I had done and they kind of rolled their eyes like, ‘Good luck with that, people just don’t give away $40,000 every day,’” she said. “And then I got the email that we got the grant and I’ve been interviewed by them and they’re super excited about what we’re doing with it.”

GAC president Jeff Malmgren said cancelling the in-person studio tour was a hard call to make, but it was done with the support of the arts community. The press release notes that the majority of Gabriola artists surveyed were either “uneasy” about participating or closing their studios altogether during the tour and “there was an understanding that the risks could outweigh the rewards.”

“In a time of tough decisions, this one was maybe the toughest,” Malmgren said in the release. “The Thanksgiving Tour holds a critical place in the culture of our community – its value extends from the artists themselves to the people and businesses in the community to the hundreds from off-island who mark it as a must do in their cultural calendar each year.”

Fergusson said 60 artists will be featured when The Arts on Gabriola is launched in mid-to late-September, but it will eventually be open to artists outside of the tour as well. She said the website will serve as a permanent GAC resource where people can look up artists, learn about them, see their work and be able to contact them.

“That’s why it’s called The Arts with an ‘s’ on Gabriola, is because it will be opened up to musicians, we’ll be able to host videos and audio clips, and on everyone’s page there is a form that is a direct link to the artist … so you can start a conversation about a piece that you see online,” she said.

A group of local artists are reconvening to put on a diverse art exhibition in south Nanaimo.

On Sept. 6, 9 Artists by the River present their second annual art show. Once again it will take place on founding member Lauren Kent’s property by the Nanaimo River, with each artist in their own tent in Kent’s garden.

Group member Barbara Ann Scott said the inaugural show was a success.

“It went very well indeed. We attracted quite a crowd and everyone sold quite a bit of work,” she said. “We were very happy and it was great to talk to the pubic and explain about our work and it was in such a beautiful setting.”

The other returning artists are Brenda Kelly, Janis Uvanile, Lynne Cross, Bonnie Stebbings, Lynda Morrison, Frank Kobe and Bobbi Jordan. Together they represent a range of artistic styles and media, including painting, mixed media, fabric art, collage, jewelry and ceramics. Works range from the realistic to the abstract.

“I do mixed media,” Scott explained. “I’m an experimental artist and I love collage so I’m always finding paper, making my own collage paper and I’m just very excited by design and composition. Lines and shapes and patterns and colours and I express my concepts abstractly.”

This year’s show will be a little different from last year. Due to COVID-19 the artists won’t be serving tea and homemade baked goods. Other pandemic safety measures include spacing out the artists, providing hand sanitizer and using directional arrows to guide visitors around the exhibits. The artists will also be collecting visitors’ contact information upon entry for contact tracing purposes “should anything happen,” Scott said.

Scott said the 9 Artists by the River are retired and very enthusiastic about their own art, but it can be difficult to find a place to display one’s work. She said that means artists have to take matters into their own hands.

“There are very few opportunities in Nanaimo to actually display local art and so artists get together and they arrange private shows open to the public so that we can display their work,” she said. “It’s similar to the Hammond Bay Studio Tour or the downtown ArtWalk, things like that. We’re trying to be very creative and give opportunities for people to learn about our art and view it and maybe buy it, too.”

WHAT’S ON … 9 Artists by the River at 1940 Burchell Rd., behind Cedar General Store, on Sunday, Sept. 6 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

A trio of local artists have been spending this past week painting new murals in downtown Nanaimo and by Saturday their work will be complete.

Kara Dee Harrison, Russell Morland and Austin Weflen were the three artists chosen to add their art to downtown walls for the inaugural Hub City Walls mural festival, put on by the Humanity in Community Foundation.

Harrison’s mural, on Front Street below Vancouver Island Military Museum, depicts otters floating through cosmic waters, Morland’s piece, at the 95 Cavan St. parking lot, shows one of his surreal, cartoony characters lounging in a bed of mushrooms, and Weflen’s piece, in the Bastion Street parkade stairway, has the phrase ‘Harbour City Livin’ emblazoned on a black and gold patterned background.

In each annual instalment, Hub City Walls will bring more murals to Nanaimo and this year’s participants agree that the city has much to gain from such a project.

“Honestly, I think it’s crucial just for the morale of the public. Seeing bits of art everywhere seems to brighten someone’s day,” Weflen said.

He added that his design is “nautical-inspired” and aims to recognize the Nanaimo and Vancouver Island lifestyle. He said he loves working with local artists and feels blessed that he was chosen for Hub City Walls.

Morland said he’s been having a lot of people stop by to watch him at work over the past week and that they’re “stoked” to see the murals go up. He described his painting as a fun image that combines the characters that he has been drawing over the past 20 years, only this time, they’re bigger than ever.

“I think most cities have something like this going on and it’s about time Nanaimo got into that groove a little bit as well,” he said. “And I think what they’re doing is a really good, positive thing for downtown.”

Also painting on her largest canvas yet is Harrison. She’s been making otter-inspired art for the past couple of years, and as those works have been well-received, she decided to return to otters for her mural design.

She said Hub City Walls reminds her of the first time she came to Vancouver Island as a child and was amazed by the number of murals she saw in Chemainus. Since then she’s always been on the lookout for public art when travelling.

“Adding more art that people can see, adding things that people can do in this town that are free, that are accessible, that are for everybody, is so important,” she said. “So I think every year adding new pieces also encourages tourists, local and from far away, to keep coming back year after year. You’re from Vancouver? Don’t go to the States, don’t go to Europe, come to the Island. It’s right here and there’s something new to see.”

There is still plenty of life in Stephenie Meyer’s “Twilight Saga.”

Meyer is planning at least two more books in her mega-selling vampire series, she said during a recent promotional event. Meanwhile, the author’s long-awaited “Midnight Sun” sold more than 1 million copies in its first week, Little, Brown Books for Young Readers announced Thursday.

While such previous novels as “New Moon” and “Eclipse” were narrated by high school student Bella Swan, “Midnight Sun” is told from the point of view of Bella’s lover, the vampire Edward Cullen.

Meyer’s new novel came out Aug. 4. She began working on “Midnight Sun” years ago, but set it aside after an early draft leaked online. Her novels have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide, and were adapted into a blockbuster film franchise starring Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson.

Meyer once vowed never to write another “Twilight” book, but on Monday she revealed during an online event held by the chain store Books-A-Million that she is far from done with Edward and Bella.

“There are two more books I think in the world that I want to write,” she said. “I have got them outlined and a chapter written I think of the first one, so I know it’s there. I am not ready to do that right now. I want to do something brand new.”

(Josef Jacobson/The News Bulletin)

This year the Nanaimo Art Gallery’s youth art camp is being held online in the participants’ homes as well as in the gallery’s workshop space and the young artists will be exploring ideas around the private and the public in their upcoming exhibition.

Due to COVID-19, Dazzle Camouflage’s five teenage artists are spending their mornings meeting online using Zoom and doing work at home before convening at the NAG’s ArtLab studio to continue their programming in a physically distanced group setting.

“We’re negotiating inside and outside space and the movement between the two and how private becomes public and vice versa,” NAG education coordinator Yvonne Vander Kooi said. “So this idea, quite literally, that kids are Zooming from their private spaces and that becomes instantly public and navigating the space between the two, that tension.”

This year the students are creating a series of paintings guided by guest artist Bracken Hanuse Corlett of Wuikinuxv and Klahoose First Nations as well as a work of video art with Vancouver-based performance and media artist Elizabeth Milton, both mentoring the participants electronically.

Last week the youths wrapped up their first week of the camp working with Milton. With her guidance the students created small cardboard sets and filmed short scenes. Milton will then use Zoom’s multi-screen format to create a quilt-like “video collage.”

In one corner of the room 15-year-old Ben James has characters cut of out of magazines exploring an empty landscape, while at the other end Meixi Scott, 18, has cut-out lightning bolts striking a clothesline.

“We’ve been working with drawing, collage and video and in some ways working with movement or animation, really DIY, lo-fi ideas of animation in the way that we’re almost puppeteering materials for the camera,” Milton said via Zoom.

This week the Dazzle Camouflage group is meeting with Hanuse Corlett to create a series of individual paintings that will be similarly displayed together to create a collage of their work.

“They’re individually working on things that have certain parameters,” Vander Kooi explained. “They have agency within that but because the parameters dictate some commonality … those are the things that will connect their work to each other so they won’t be these disparate pieces.”

On Aug. 20 the projects, titled inside – outside, will be unveiled in an online reception. The paintings will be displayed at Diana Krall Plaza before being permanently installed downtown at 13 Victoria Cres. and the video will be played on a monitor in the ArtLab window facing the street to be observed by passers-by until Aug. 27.

Milton said she’s excited to see the students’ final work.

“I think for many of them working in a way where we don’t have a predetermined outcome is really new,” she said. “So their willingness to invest in the process and willing to experiment and just allow themselves to fail and try new things has been wonderful.”

Starting in September the NAG is presenting its teen art program Code Switching and for the first time a junior program will be offered for those age 12 to 14. Contact the gallery for more information.

WHAT’S ON … Dazzle Camouflage opening reception for inside – outside will be live-streamed on Facebook and Instagram on Aug. 20 at 7 p.m.

“It’s an interjection of ideas and feelings to sort of remind us, or remind me particularly, that the future is not already spoken for,” the Gabriola Island-based poet said. “That we’ve got some things that we could and should do.”

Vickers said Sleep With Me: Lullaby for an Anxious Planet has been in works for “a few decades,” but features recent poems that respond to the contemporary world situation. She said she’s been concerned about the rise of fascism and intolerance and says new ways of thinking are needed.

“I think that once you break away from the mainstream news, once you sort of start looking at other books, other ideas, other philosophies, you can start to find a place in the world,” she said. “For me it’s finding my place in this world while I’m here.”

Vickers said she takes a “kitchen sink approach” to taking on different ideas and challenging them. In her work she hopes to also comfort readers in a way that is not “syrupy,” but hints at possibility.

“I guess one thing is our tendency to label and our tendency to think about who’s right and who’s wrong and to worry about not being experts,” she said. “To find the life that makes us the expert of our own life and yet to still be open to new ideas, to keep the conversation going. Talking about the world as if we’re part of it and we’re integral to it.”

Vickers, who is 71, said she was also motivated to write Sleep With Me because discussing issues that matter to her is what sustains her and she wants to continue that dialogue for as long as she is able.

“I thought, as I’m getting older, this might be the last thing that I write,” she said. “And I really feel alive when I speak with people about world events and hear their personal ideas and can contribute. So conversations about peace and justice, these are things that keep me alive.”

Sleep With Me: Lullaby for an Anxious Planet, is available online.

Paula Spurr is used to being herded together with co-workers on the job.

As a background performer in film and TV, the Burnaby, B.C., actress has been packed with colleagues in groups under tents outside, sometimes for up to 14 hours, while they await their scenes.

“We’re very tight together; we’re used to it, it’s how we usually exist in that world,” says Spurr, whose credits include the series “Snowpiercer” and “See.”

“But that’s not possible anymore.”

RELATED: Greater Victoria actor stars in upcoming Netflix film The Half of It

With many productions limiting the amount of people in scenes and on set to create physical distancing to decrease COVID-19 infection risk, Spurr says her already unpredictable line of work has “become very uncertain.”

Showrunners have been changing scenes to have little or no background performers, she says.

She’s even heard of some smaller-budget productions using mannequins “in the deep background” these days.

“It’s like, ‘Oh great, we’re being replaced with dummies,’” Spurr says with a laugh.

Background is usually a non-speaking part that helps fill out scenes surrounding main characters.

For stories set in a fixed place, such as a small town or a “Star Trek” ship, some background performers are recurring faces to add continuity.

But often they do one-off gigs and don’t know the details of their next job until the night before, says Spurr.

Productions in Canada usually first hire veteran background performers from the ACTRA union, who are known as full members, before looking to the less experienced membership tiers and non-union workers.

“So if you’re not a union background performer, your chances of working now are slim to none,” says Spurr, who is a full union member.

“All those spots have to be filled by a union performer. There’s not that many to go around, and I’m not sure how many of us can continue to do it as a sole method of income, which it was for me.”

Jason Boyd, who lives in Brantford, Ont., says he works primarily in background performing because “getting acting gigs on a regular basis in Toronto isn’t as simple as people seem to think it is.”

“Most of the larger roles or continuity roles are filled in L.A.,” says Boyd, a full ACTRA member with credits including the Disney film “Zombies” and “The Handmaid’s Tale” series.

Boyd notes there are hardly any productions happening in Canada right now, so work is scarce for everyone in an industry that’s inherently fraught with uncertainty.

And the size of casts is getting smaller in every category, from background to principal actors to stunts.

But he’s happy to see precautions being taken and is willing to lose out on a few days of work to ensure safety.

“My expectation is that we’ll get back to a reasonably normal amount of work,” Boyd says. “But the work on set is going to be different.”

When Spurr worked on a recent production in B.C., the background performers had to wear masks when cameras weren’t rolling and weren’t packed tightly together, even in the scene, she says.

“The holding area where they kept us was very safe. They had set up a bigger tent than they normally would. And we were only allowed to two to a long table.”

ACTRA Toronto president Theresa Tova predicts more productions will start using the same background performers in multiple scenes for a longer period of time to keep the same germ pool on set.

In pre-COVID days, background performers were often hired for just one day and worked on multiple productions a week.

Tova says producers used to be worried the high-definition cameras made background performers’ faces too identifiable to reuse them.

“What I see is the producers maybe going back to the way they used to cast background, where you would have folks brought back again and again and again, and put them into different wardrobe, put them in a wig, put them in glasses,” says Tova.

RELATED: Former Vancouver Island student makes his mark in Hollywood

She points to her days acting on the Canadian series “ENG,” which used the same 15 to 20 background performers every week during its run from 1989-‘94.

Boyd says he knows a veteran actor who worked on a show in the ’80s that used crafty ways to make background actors look different in street scenes.

“He says they would, at the beginning of the scene, have the performer put on eight shirts and they would walk by,” Boyd says.

“And then they would get off camera, boom, take off a shirt; walk back, put on a hat and take off a shirt… They would walk differently and have different gaits, and instead of hiring 40 backgrounds, they only needed seven.”

But productions need to be inclusive and representative with those roles, to ensure stories “reflect the composition of society that we see on our streets,” Tova adds.

Spurr says one of her best background-actor friends was recently hired for an entire season on a series with guaranteed pay for five days a week, so Tova’s prediction might be right.

“It’s unheard of in the background,” Spurr says. “So that kind of thing would be great.

“But I don’t think that’s going to happen for a lot of people. So everybody else is nervous and looking for alternate streams of revenue.”

When long-time chef Nicholas Waters first started Toque Catering in 2013, he never expected it to take off.

“To be honest, I thought I’d be doing one function a weekend,” he says with a laugh. “I didn’t think anything of it. Then all of a sudden, it turned into an animal.”

Toque grew from just five full-timers three years ago to a staff almost 30 strong today, and the wealth of talent in Nick’s kitchen is enviable.

“We run with 10 to 12 executive chefs full time in the kitchen,” he says. “It’s one of the best teams I’ve ever worked with.”

About the same time Toque took off, Nick relocated to Metchosin, and the locale has been ideal both personally and professionally.

“The bigger we’ve gotten, the more local we’ve become,” he says.

Toque is booked at least a year in advance, so Nick and his team have been able to approach local farmers well ahead of season to plan out orders, translating to reliable income for the small agriculture sector, as well as premium ingredients.

And though Nick says he doesn’t want to grow too big too fast, there are definitely some new and exciting directions coming down the pipe.

“Stay tuned!”

The 7 Sins

Envy:

Whose shoes would you like to walk in?

I am on my own journey in life and wouldn’t change a thing, good or bad, but I would love to be Michel Bras in Normandy, France for a day. He has been my favourite chef in the world since I was 18! His book is still better than most out there and it’s almost 20 years old.

Gluttony:

What is the food you could eat over and over again?

That is definitely a hard one, but I would say gyoza. No matter whether I’m at a pub, home or a high-end restaurant, 10 out of 10 times I will order it if it’s on the menu.

Greed:

You’re given $1 million that you have to spend selfishly. What would you spend it on?

I would travel all through Europe and eat and drink and just eat and drink until it was gone. Spain, Portugal, France, Italy — let’s face it, the money would be gone by then!

wrath:

Pet Peeves?

Everything, almost … but the freezers and coolers being a mess has to be the one that makes me think I’m going to have a heart attack.

sloth:

Where would you spend a long time doing nothing?

Spain.

Pride:

What is the one thing you’re secretly proud of?

It won’t be a secret anymore if I say this, but it would be the team — chefs, dishwashers, operations, planners, on-site service staff, rentals and anyone else I’m missing — and the culture we’ve been able to create at Toque. I am grateful every day that I get to work alongside a very, very talented group. I actually like working with them all and don’t have a bad thing to say. They’ve all become my family.

Lust:

What makes your heart beat faster?

Being on-site when shit hits the fan — like a barbecue falls off the top and an oven doesn’t work, etc. That shit turns me on when you come out of it unscathed and everything went perfectly, except your soul becomes a little darker!

I love the unknown and being able to make something out of nothing. The best was four or five years ago when the guys got me an Easy-Bake Oven for Christmas. They said, “Well, it’s on. Let’s see what you can do with this!’”

Don Denton/Boulevard Dining bar and kitchen in Ingrid Jarisz condo.

Despite being on my first home tour in a long time, stepping into this Sayward Hill condo feels like slipping on a favourite pair of shoes.

I take in the compass rose laid out in the bricked pathway outside and the oversize nature photos in the tidy lobby. I make a note of the territorial hummingbird that buzzes past and the light feel of ocean in the wind. And when Ingrid, the homeowner, meets me at the front door to lead me down to her unit, I’m thrilled that she’s as warm and lovely as I’d expected by her emails.

We walk into the condo, past a home office and a den with a spectacular ‘70s-era couch, both lulling me into a “condo” mentality, and then, I stop in my socked feet, utterly surprised.

The kitchen, beautifully balanced with white and oak cabinetry and stainless steel appliances, is large and open enough to accommodate a tightly turned Viennese waltz, if the dancers are sure-footed.

The unit is just over 2,000 square feet, she tells me, a perfect middle ground between downsizing from house living and not sacrificing space and storage for something easier to manage.

But this kitchen. Oh, this kitchen. It’s bright and airy, with oodles of natural light. The quartz countertops are smooth while still adding texture, and the marble honeycomb tile lining the wall beneath the cupboards is warm with gorgeous colour variations. It all comes together in a very chateau feel, and it’s just wonderful.

For Ingrid’s “foodie” daughter and son-in-law, there’s a six-burner gas range and double wall oven, as well as the double-door fridge and walk-in pantry. There’s also an extra built-in beverage centre with a bar fridge and a built-in coffee machine, an upgrade that Ingrid and her husband took immediate advantage of.

“We’re coffee snobs!” she admits with a laugh. “Waking up to the sunrise and turning on the coffee machine — it’s my favourite thing!”

On the other side of the counter sits a fantastic dining table with black accents and clawed feet in the open dining area, ready to expand in the event of company, and the living room sets up a surprisingly expansive view of Cordova Bay, given that the development borders the thick trees of Sayward Hill Park.

The master bedroom comfortably fits a king bed and dresser and comes with its own larger-than-life view, where Mount Baker is currently peeking up above a thin line of clouds. Ingrid disappears behind me as I take in the view, and after a moment I follow, thinking we’ll have a quick look at the closet and pocket en suite before returning to the tour.

What I’m not expecting is to come around the corner into a long, luxurious master en suite complete with double sinks, beautiful soaker tub, roomy glassed-in shower, heated tile floors and so much cupboard and drawer space I think I actually go a little green with envy.

“There’s so much storage. I haven’t even filled up all the space yet,” she says, opening a few of the cupboard doors.

Just on the other side of the bathroom door is a walk-in closet that could rival most of the other Hot Properties closets I’ve seen over the years. I’m so surprised by the size that I don’t notice it’s also a walk-through until Ingrid points out the laundry room at the other end.

“It’s a really efficient design,” she says, and adds that the connection from the walk-in closet to the laundry room was an element that was brought in after talking to residents of other buildings in the development.

The entire Sayward Hill project spanned almost 20 years, Ingrid tells me, with the first development finished in 2001. Amazingly, the entire development team stayed consistent from the first ground breaking to the completion of the last condo building. The same builders, the same architects, the same plumbing contractors, the same designer, everyone stayed involved, making for an almost unheard-of level of synergy throughout the build.

And not only that, but after each phase was complete, the team made a dedicated effort to get feedback from the people actually living in the spaces, and then sat down and round-tabled ideas to implement in the next stages.

“We would all sit together, including the architects, and we would design the light switches,” says Ingrid, smiling. It allowed for a natural evolution of the project, and a number of details that make this particular condo stand out.

As well as the double access to the laundry room, the guest bedroom is situated on the opposite side of the condo to add a sense of privacy for visitors, and there’s a pocket door that can close off the bedroom and bathroom for added separation. A barn door can separate the small home office tucked between the den and the kitchen. And one of my favourite features is at the front entrance: the hallway wall curves gently wide and away the further you come in, leading you into the rest of the house and creating an immediate and welcoming sense of space. The design is subtle and natural enough that I didn’t actually notice it at first, which makes sense the more time I spend here.

Compared to some of the houses featured in Boulevard, Ingrid’s condo is relatively compact, but it never feels cramped, or that anything was sacrificed in the name of efficiency. More than that, the design as a whole feels effortless. I’m instantly so comfortable, so at home, that I have to remember to look for the details.

“Kimberly has an elegance about her,” says Ingrid, quick to praise interior designer Kimberly Williams, also involved with the project since day one. “Her design is timeless.”

“All the projects on Sayward Hill were definitely designed with longevity in mind,” says Kimberly. “Durability and flexibility are extremely important in executing good design. We try to stay true to classic elements, which equates to timeless designs. I am so very proud of this project!”

“This is a development that’s near and dear to my heart,” adds Ingrid.

Having worked selling the units for the past 20 years, she’s seen their evolution and their unmatched quality.

“It felt like my second home. This is the last piece of the puzzle, and it feels right to be here now. This feels like the pinnacle of Sayward.”

Some are anytime balls, and some are workout balls.
It’s effectively ensuring that you can feel good about snacking and, more importantly, feel good from snacking.","Snacking is often driven by convenience, cravings and the urge to quickly soothe those hunger pangs. By mid-afternoon, many of us are reaching for a little something to get us through a workout or tide us over until dinner — chocolate bar and coffee at 3 pm sound familiar?

But many of those convenient and accessible packaged and baked goods offer a short-lived energy boost, followed by the ever-dreaded sugar crash. And as we become more health-conscious and active, the demand for nutritious, guilt-free snack alternatives is on the rise.

With this in mind, Ann Conrod and Sean Wallbridge, founders of Victoria’s Ballsy Foods, have created a line of protein balls, a highly customizable snack alternative offered in a variety of flavour and dietary profiles to curb energy dips and boost nutrient consumption. (And, yes, the company has a lot of fun using various plays on the word “balls.”)

Ann, who is also the owner of a nutrition coaching company called Fettle + Food and a personal trainer at Innovative Fitness, began incorporating protein balls into her clients’ weekly diets.

“The biggest challenge for a lot of people is meal prep and finding healthy snacks. I started making up recipes for protein balls to fill this void. I’d make them weekly, [customized] specifically for my clients,” Ann explains.

One of those clients was Sean.

“Sean was one of the biggest supporters; he loved the protein balls right away. He is not one to sit down and have big meals during the day, preferring to eat something quick and small several times a day to keep his energy levels up,” says Ann.

During their personal training sessions at Innovative Fitness, Sean began putting the bug in Ann’s ear to start a protein ball company.

“These balls last seven to 10 days in the fridge, and I don’t feel guilty about eating them. I know I’m eating something healthy and I don’t crash,” Sean explains.

Operating as an online store, exclusively servicing Greater Victoria, the balls are handmade to order on Sundays.

“All weekly orders are made fresh on Sunday and are delivered free to your home that night or Monday morning,” says Sean, “We offer packs of 12 in glass containers which allow us to avoid waste.”

The store has two constant flavours — the Bl’ann’d Ball and the Blue Ball — and one rotating flavour that changes every four to eight weeks. All of the balls are gluten-free, and the Bl’ann’d Balls are also vegan.

“All of our balls are oat-based, so they are not keto. We are aiming to bring sugar levels down, so they are lightly sweetened with maple syrup or honey. Every ball is filled with healthy carbs, fibre and protein powder. The other flavours incorporated are based on the specific ball,” says Ann.

Every ball comes with directions for consumption. Some are anytime balls, and some are workout balls.

“You could eat all of the balls anytime, but some give you a bit more energy before or after a workout and sustain you until your next meal. The highest carb count is 15 grams, and protein ranges from four to six grams depending on the type of ball,” explains Ann.

With rotating flavours that have included chocolate and salted caramel, Ballsy Foods is making it easy for you to keep your hands off that secret desk drawer filled with sweet treats. It’s effectively ensuring that you can feel good about snacking and, more importantly, feel good from snacking."

I meet Terry at her lakeshore boutique and, surrounded by beautiful things, we chat about life, style and what fires her up about her work. (“The people!” she says.)

Originally from Saskatchewan, Terry moved to Kelowna 12 years ago after realizing, she says, that life is too short to continue living in 40-degree-below weather. “In my late 40s I had a couple of acquaintances my own age pass away and I realized I had to make a change.”

Since she has been in the retail business for over 30 years, I wonder what innate quality has led to her success. She laughs. “I’m just an outgoing person, an effervescent person…although, last year I turned 60 so it’s petering off a bit.”

As we chat, the door opens and two women walk in. They are clearly regular customers, and as Terry’s effervescent personality comes to life, a conversation between them begins. I gather it is an ongoing dialogue that has been years in the making.

So I ask one of the women what she loves about the store, and she says, “It’s inspiring. When you walk in here it makes you think, ‘oh, I want that.’ It makes you want to do something with your house.”

Asked to describe the aesthetic of the store, Terry says, “Modern and current.” But she is quick to point out that she can’t take all the credit for the style of the shop.

“Barb is really the brains behind the operation,” Terry laughs as she talks about a woman who works for her. “I feel it’s good to have input from other people and Barb is an awesome merchandiser. I don’t buy anything for the store without running it by her first.”

Looking to the future, Terry’s vision is to continue to stay ahead of the curve on what Lexi & Lake brings to Kelowna. “I don’t follow trends; we set trends here.”

Claudia has always been someone I’ve gone to for fashion inspiration. When I have a nugget of an idea but need to distil it into a concrete concept, I’ve relied on her knowledge of fashion and trends and her passion for all things visual. She also has a strong sense of personal style and with her boutique Bernstein & Gold, she brings a fresh, current and bold aesthetic that has elevated this city to the category of fashion forward.

So, it is a real treat to meet Claudia for a chat about her life, style and inspiration, and what she holds as important. She’s owned a retail boutique in Victoria for close to 20 years, so I wonder what aspect of her work fires her up and keeps her going.

“It’s the customers and the fashion,” she says. “There’s a thrill in the buying for the next season: the trends, colours and fabrics, and what direction I’m going to take the store next. And that all comes from feedback I get from clients while working on the floor; being on the floor is everything.”

And what is Claudia most excited about for spring 2020? “There’s an interesting mix. The ’90s are definitely showing up again, and wild florals in big prairie poofs.”

Asked what innate quality has led to her success, Claudia says her strength lies in the buying. “Choosing out of the million things you see, sifting through countless amounts of pictures and fabric swatches, going to the showrooms, meeting designers and really paring it down. It’s about trusting your instincts and being able to take risks. It can’t be boring, it needs to be fresh but still wearable. That’s what I spend the most time fretting about — it has to be right.”

And what essential daily practice has she adopted in her work?

“Something that I try to show up with every morning is — listening to customers. They are coming through the door, they chose to spend their time with me and it has to be special, it has to be personal, it has to be meaningful to them in all aspects of the interaction. I have a great team and they all subscribe to that same philosophy.”

Since she is the mother of a toddler, I asked Claudia: what is the best life lesson she’s recently learned?

“One big thing I’m passionate about is self-care and wellness and making it a priority in my life. Going back to basics — from natural skincare to even the type of clothes and how much that you buy — incorporating the right things into your life, making better choices and honouring what matters to you. My self-care practice is focused on my garden because it’s something I can do with my son. It’s all about keeping your body well to preserve yourself, so you can be there for that person. You don’t think about that in your 20s very much, or at least I didn’t.”

When it comes to personal style, Claudia says she likes things pretty and casual.

“I’ve always liked flowing blouses, nice fabrics and patterns, but most days I’m in jeans and sneakers because I’m running around and I need to be able to move.”

So what does good style mean? “It has to feel like it’s you. And it’s a feeling; it’s the way your body responds in clothes, the way you move. It doesn’t have to be expensive or be designer, it just needs to feel like there has been some thought behind it. It has to work for the person and you can usually tell by the way they carry themselves in it.”

Nanaimo firefighters and young burn survivors amped up a donation presentation to not only make their film debuts, but win a people’s choice award.

Each July the B.C. Professional Fire Fighters Burn Fund hosts Burn Camp for young burn survivors age six to 18. Firefighters from Nanaimo and elsewhere volunteer as camp counsellors, but because of COVID-19 this is the first year the burn survivors and counsellors couldn’t hold camp in person, so Burn Camp was hosted virtually with fire departments creating and submitting videos to announce donations and send messages to the kids.

Nanaimo Firefighters Charitable Society raised $2,500 from donations made to the society throughout the year during community events or training sessions with local service clubs and organizations.

“We have our own fishing derby where we all get together and go raise money that way … or service clubs that are doing something and say they need first aid [volunteers], so then we go there and do that sort of stuff,” said Umesh Lal, Nanaimo Fire Rescue fire prevention officer and B.C. Professional Fire Fighters Burn Fund board director. “So that’s the majority of it. Just helping out other organizations.”

One of the Burn Camp traditions is for counsellors and burn survivors to have a water fight that could involve up to 90 kids and counsellors on the opening day of the camp, but with camp going virtual because of COVID-19, Nanaimo firefighters opted to take the water fight online.

“The fire service is a bunch of Type A personalities that want to one-up everybody else,” Lal said. “This year, because everything was virtual, you could either just send in a picture or story or video. One thing led to another.”

Firefighters shot the video at Harewood Centennial Park and cast firefighters Greg Finstad, Lal, Justin Lynch and Nanaimo Fire Rescue chief Karen Fry, using water guns and fire hoses to make sure everyone got a soaking that would look good on camera, especially in slow motion. A musical score was even added to enhance the dramatic effect of the deluge.

The video, along with submissions from other fire departments, was made the third week of July when camp counsellors and up to 60 burn survivors came together online to share pictures and stories from over the past year and of what they did with camp counsellors in their own communities. Lal said sharing the experiences online gave the kids a continued sense of belonging and continuity of the relationships they’d built up together over the years. The kids attending this year’s virtual burn camp chose Nanaimo’s video as their favourite among the submissions.

“There was a total of 13 videos submitted from firefighter locals across the province, who were all competing for the title of People’s Choice Award,” said Nicole Clark, British Columbia Professional Fire Fighters’ Burn Fund, communications director, in an e-mail.

COVID-19 is affecting back-to-school planning, but a campaign to raise money and collect supplies for vulnerable students across Nanaimo-Ladysmith is as important as ever.

While specific details have yet to be announced, Nanaimo Ladysmith Public Schools’ students will be returning full-time in September. Nanaimo-Ladysmith Schools Foundation’s Stock the Lockers drive officially started yesterday, Aug. 1, and donations will be accepted until Aug. 31, with a fundraising target of $50,000.

Coronavirus temporarily halted in-class instruction in March and it remains to be seen how the pandemic will affect fundraising, said Crystal Dennison, foundation executive director.

“Everybody’s really uncertain around … what the structure of the school’s going to look like, how it’s going to affect families and staff at the schools and teachers, but what we do know is there’s still students that are going to be needing our support,” said Dennison.”So we’re doing what we can to make sure that we raise funds to allow them their basic school supplies and running shoes and the same supports that we always have.”

The foundation distributed food hampers to students who couldn’t access meal programs during the COVID-19 school stoppage, and that will continue for the foreseeable future, Dennison said.

RELATED: SD68 students back to school, full-time, in ‘learning groups’

“Even for August, we are still providing hampers to families, part of the Food for Schools program,” said Dennison. “We’re not doing home delivery, but we are doing contactless pickup for families at schools throughout the district and we’re looking at, with the return of school and the planning that is going on right now, how we will be continuing to support families.”

In addition to food and school supplies, money donated will go toward running shoes, medical or eyeglass needs and incidentals such as athletic, field trip and graduation fees.

People can make a donation at Staples and Country Grocer locations in Nanaimo as well as Coastal Community Credit Union locations, including one on Gabriola Island.

Stock the Lockers raised $42,000 in 2019, according to Dennison.

Community members are asked to take part in the Walk for Alzheimer’s, not only by taking a stroll, but also by choosing their own route.

The IG Wealth Management Walk for Alzheimer’s is moving online for 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and happens Sunday, May 31. The online portion of the event is at 9 a.m., and participants will hear from people across Canada who have been affected by dementia. Those wishing to walk for Alzheimer’s will then be encouraged to move in any way they choose.

“Dementia doesn’t stop and neither do we,” said Maria Howard, CEO of the Alzheimer Society of B.C., in a press release. “Even though the ways we are delivering our programs and services have needed to change, we are still committed to helping British Columbians affected by dementia.”

According to the society, more than 70,000 British Columbians live with dementia.

To register for the virtual walk, visit http://walkforalzheimers.ca. Participants can create a fundraising page to share with friends and family, with proceeds funding programs and services in local communities as well as research into causes and a cure for dementia.
