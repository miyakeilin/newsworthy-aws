Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps said in a recent message to parents that she doesn’t think the tents should be in that portion of Beacon Hill Park.
For now, Fleming said, there could be a committee of parents formed to “sweep” the grounds each morning for things like needles.

Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps said in a recent message to parents that she doesn’t think the tents should be in that portion of Beacon Hill Park. “It has become clear over the last few weeks, with the needles, feces and garbage on school property and all the broken windows, that it is not appropriate to have people camping across from an elementary school.”

Parent representative Rich Fleming said there has been a “strong commitment from the city” to try to use bylaws to solve the problem.

“They’re pushing the resources they can toward it,” he said.

For now, Fleming said, there could be a committee of parents formed to “sweep” the grounds each morning for things like needles. “Obviously, that’s not the desired solution at all.”

Like many others, people in the South Park community have a “deep desire” to see a more overarching solution to homelessness issues, beyond what they see near the school, Fleming said.

“Obviously, we don’t want [tents] near a school and [to] put the kids at risk,” said Fleming, who has a child entering Grade 2 at the school as well as two younger children.

He said there have been up to 20 tents visible from South Park.

Greater Victoria School Board chairwoman Jordan Watters said that safety is “the No. 1 priority.”

“We’re watching the situation,” she said.

Overnight sheltering is allowed in several city parks, including Beacon Hill, and council has opted not to enforce rules requiring people to pack up during the day while there is a pandemic. The city received an injunction allowing it to remove people from sensitive areas of the park, but there are still dozens of tents in the area.

Helps said she believes it is appropriate to amend the parks bylaw to prohibit sheltering close to the school.

“I understand that staff are working on a series of bylaw amendments to propose to council in September that will address this and other issues around the city,” she said.

She noted that provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has advised that students returning to school should spend as much time as possible outdoors, something that unsafe grounds would prevent.

Victoria Coun. Marianne Alto said she agrees with Helps about the tents needing to move.

“I think there’s no doubt at all that having tents … that close to a school isn’t the most optimal situation,” she said. “We’re very well aware that there are better ways to deal with the reality of that site.”

Alto said Victoria’s committee of the whole meets next on Sept. 3, so she doesn’t expect measures to be in place by the time students return to school on Sept. 10.

“I’m really hoping that we’ll be able to get a handle on this very soon.”

The CRD is developing new management plans for East Sooke and a joint plan for Roche Cove and Matheson Lake, which are in close proximity.

As part of initial engagement, the CRD said the surveys will help CRD Regional Parks gather background information on how members use the parks.

CRD is also seeking input from First Nations, government agencies and stakeholder groups.

“These plans will provide strategic and specific management direction and will guide environmental conservation, cultural heritage management, visitor use and park development over the next 15 to 20 years,” the CRD said in a statement.

Matheson Lake Regional Park is a 156-hectare property in Metchosin acquired in 1994. It features the lake and small beach, forested hills and several kilometres of trails.

Roche Cove Regional Park was established in 1985 and comprises 162 hectares around a sheltered cove in the Sooke Basin. The park has trails through cedar forests, along Matheson Creek and to mossy hilltops.

East Sooke Regional Park, established in 1970, is the third largest park in CRD system at 1,457 hectares. It has 49 kilometres of trails through forest, marsh and fields, including a challenging 10-kilometre trail along the coast.

One of the fires on Mount Healy grew to about eight hectares overnight and is listed as “out of control” by the B.C. Wildfire Service. However, a statement by the Capital Regional District on Tuesday morning said the fire was about 40 per cent contained.

“It is anticipated that the fire will be 100 per cent contained [Tuesday afternoon] as it is exhausting its fuel source,” the CRD said.

Lightning strikes Sunday night, after days of extreme heat, sparked more a dozen fires on the South Island. High temperatures and steady winds continue today and more resources have been added to fight the fires.

The CRD said the other fire, near Horton Lake, is in an isolated area and is approaching about five hectares in size.

Aircraft dropped fire retardant and water over the most of the day on Monday and are continuing today.

At least seven skimmer aircraft are filling pontoons on Shawnigan Lake and helicopters with water buckets arebeing used.

The CRD said ground crews were hiking in this morning to set up a containment perimeter.

A fire control specialist from the B.C. Wildfire Management Branch is the commander on the fires and is working with the CRD’s watershed protection wildfire staff.

The CRD said there are 18 CRD watershed protection staff and two water tanker trucks working on containing the Mount Healey wildfire.

“It appears that the nature of the terrain and fuels in the area should reduce the potential for further spread,” the CRD said.

The B.C. Wildfire Management Branch has committed two 20-person crews, 16 contract firefighters and four helicopters with water buckets to the fire today. Provincial staff will be working on both fires. The focus of the helicopter water drops will be on preventing the spread of the fire near Horton Lake.

The CRD said there is no impact to operations or water quality at this time.

However, because the fires have burned areas in the catchment of Sooke Lake Reservoir, CRD staff have started preparations for an assessment of impacts and erosion potential after the fires have been suppressed and are developing plans for minimizing any post-wildfire erosion this winter.

West Shore RCMP arrested one person who were taken to the station to sober up and on Sunday nabbed an impaired driver after bylaw officers saw the person stumbling to the parking lot.

View Royal Fire Chief Paul Hurst said the main measure of success is that there were no calls for services relating to injuries in the park.

“This was a proactive initiative instead of a reactive measure,” Hurst said. “Having all three agencies there was a success.”

Don Brown, the CRD’s chief bylaw officer, said the focus was on educating people about the rules and preventing people from doing risky things like cliff jumping while intoxicated.

Bylaw officers issued 12 written warnings, mostly for smoking or having open alcohol, and handed out four bylaw tickets for open alcohol.

Having View Royal Fire’s zodiac patrol the water was a major deterrent for people thinking of risky behaviour, Brown said.

Brown said many families thanked the officers for patrolling and keeping the park safe. West Shore RCMP said Friday they will be working with CRD bylaw officers and View Royal Fire to patrol popular parks for the rest of the summer.

Hurst said there were hundreds of people in the water on Sunday, despite the CRD’s advisory that people and animals shouldn’t swim because of a blue-green algae bloom. The poisonous algae bloom produces cyanotoxins which can be lethal to dogs if ingested and for humans can results in symptoms such as headaches and abdominal pain.

Brown said people in the water were warned about the health impacts of the blue-green algae.

Hurst has been calling for enhanced safety measures at the park after a series of concerning calls in July, including one involving an unconscious and apparently intoxicated person on a trail and another where a man who was drinking injured himself while jumping from a cliff into the lake.

“The obvious concern we have is the alcohol consumption coupled with jumping off the cliffs,” he said. “Those two behaviours don’t go well together.”

Hurst has suggested closing the back side of the park in the summer months to prevent people from cliff jumping, or even sending the emergency response bill to intoxicated or careless people who injure themselves while jumping.

“Currently there’s nothing prohibiting people from jumping off the cliffs other than common sense,” he said. “Why is it the responsibility for the View Royal taxpayer to foot the bill for people who are making conscious bad decisions? These are conscious decisions to put yourself in harms way.”

Hurst said once the summer is over, he will meet with CRD officials to talk about longer term safety strategies for Thetis Lake Regional Park. According to CRD statistics, Thetis Lake has become increasingly busy with 500,000 visits to the park in 2018 compared to 350,000 in 2010.

One fire crew from Saanich’s Vernon Avenue fire station currently operates out of the recreational centre.

The District of Saanich said it hopes to work with community partners to offer alternate services for youth in the Tillicum neighbourhood in the fall.

“We are well aware of the impact the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social and physical isolation has had on youth in the community,” said Chris Filler, youth programmer for the municipality. “Teens are disproportionately affected by the social impact of COVID-19 and as a result of the disruption to school, social connections, music, art and sport routines, youth have had a hard time connecting with each other as well as meeting their own needs of self-care and well-being.”

Other recreation centres offering youth programs include the Upside Teen Centre at Saanich Commonwealth Place and the Backdoor Teen Centre at Gordon Head Recreation Centre.

Programs including Red Cross babysitting, judo, pottery, home alone, Aikido and some organized sports. In addition, the Backdoor Teen Centre offers specialty programming such as an outdoor club, LGBTQ2+ social program and crafters club.

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

article continues below

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister.
""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

The gravitas of the moment was not lost on the former journalist and mother of three. After she spoke the English words of her oath of office, she paused to take a deep breath, before repeating the oath in French.

article continues below

""It's about time,"" Freeland said later at a press conference on Parliament Hill.

She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.

Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.

But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.

""There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,"" said Turnbull. ""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.""

Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.

She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.

""We don't like their representative very much,"" he said of her in September 2018.

Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said ""Mama (does not equal) chopped liver."" On the back it said ""Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.""

When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.

And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.

""She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,"" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.

He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.

""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.

""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.

""I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,"" he said. ""And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.""

She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.

""What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,"" Kelly said on Twitter. ""This has been missing in the department for several years.""

MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.

While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.

Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.

Trudeau said Tuesday that she had been ""a key player in my government from day one.""

The Nisga'a Lisims government said Tuesday that Gosnell died in his home in New Aiyansh after a long battle with cancer.

Gosnell was a hereditary Nisga'a chieftain of the Eagle Clan and was president of the nation when it finalized a landmark treaty in 2000 that gave the First Nation control over its land including forestry and fishing rights. It was the first modern-day treaty signed in B.C. since the 1800s.

Nisga'a Nation president Eva Clayton said Gosnell's wisdom, dignity and determination helped lead the First Nation into self-government over its territory northeast of Prince Rupert.

""Today, we have lost a giant,"" Clayton said in a statement. ""His legacy will help shape the project of reconciliation for generations to come.""

Gosnell was a recipient of the Order of Canada, the Order of B.C. and held an honorary doctorate of laws from Royal Roads University in Victoria.

He is survived by his wife of 64 years, Audrey, their seven children and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Gosnell grew up in the Nass River Valley in B.C.'s northwest. He worked as a commercial fisherman, carpenter and traditional carver before he was elected as a band councillor and chief of the Gitlaxt'aamiks Band, one of the Nisga'a village governments.

Gosnell was appointed chancellor of the University of Northern B.C. last year and served until his death.

University interim president Geoffrey Payne said Gosnell's dedication to education was evident during his time as chancellor.

""The world has lost a tremendous leader, a man who repeatedly demonstrated a love for his community, his people, education and a commitment to enhancing the lives of others,"" Payne said in a statement.

Clayton said Gosnell's work to negotiate the Nisga'a Treaty produced a ""beacon of hope"" for people around the world.

""His focus was always on what the Nisga'a, British Columbians and Canadians can achieve together,"" she said.

When a bill to accept the treaty was introduced in the legislature in December 1998, Gosnell told the house the agreement proved to the world that reasonable people can sit down and settle historical wrongs.

""It's a triumph because under the treaty, we will no longer be wards of the state, no longer beggars in our own land. It's a triumph because under the treaty, we will collectively own approximately 2,000 square kilometres of land, far exceeding the postage-stamp reserve set aside for us by colonial governments.""

He said the treaty proved that negotiations — not lawsuits, blockades or violence — are the most effective and honourable way to resolve Aboriginal issues.

""It's a triumph, I believe, that signals the end of the Indian Act, the end of more than a century of humiliation, degradation and despair for the Nisga'a Nation.""

Premier John Horgan said in a tweet that everyone can learn from Gosnell's legacy of working to make life better for people and he'll be missed.

""He was instrumental in helping the Nisga'a chart a new path of self-governance through BC's first modern treaty.""

The nation said funeral arrangements will be announced by the family.

That worst-case scenario was on the minds of some federal politicians as they watched New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs pull the plug Monday on his minority Conservative government, becoming the first jurisdiction in Canada to send voters to the polls in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

New Brunswick's example will doubtless offer some lessons on how to conduct an election safely.

It may also embolden other federal opposition parties to join the Bloc Quebecois in its determination to bring down Justin Trudeau's government at the first opportunity. That opportunity will arise sooner than expected with the prime minister's announcement Tuesday that Parliament is being prorogued and will return Sept. 23 with a throne speech. A vote on the speech will be a test of confidence in the government.

For that matter, Higgs' example may embolden Trudeau to pull the plug himself.

And it has NDP democratic reform critic Daniel Blaikie appealing to his counterparts in other federal parties to begin discussing now how best to safely conduct a federal election during the pandemic rather than sleepwalk into potential chaos.

""The worst thing would be to get to the point where we're saying, 'OK, we're having an election' and then having these disputes about the process and having somebody within the political system decide that it's in their best interests to start assailing the legitimacy of the process that's already under way,"" he said in an interview.

Without some all-party consensus on how to conduct an election safely, Blaikie fears Canada could wind up in a situation similar to the United States, where Donald Trump is making unsubstantiated assertions that mail-in ballots will result in rampant voter fraud during November's presidential election.

""We don't need a political crisis on top of a public health and economic crisis,"" he said.

As part of its preparations for a possible election during the pandemic, Elections Canada has set up an internal working group to assess the agency's ability to conduct the vote safely — including its capacity to handle mail-in ballots, find alternative polling station locations and keep both voters and poll workers safe.

But there's only so much Elections Canada can do under current law. In a post on its website about the impact of the pandemic on election planning, the agency notes for instance that Parliament would have to change the Canada Elections Act to allow for an election to be conducted entirely by mail-in ballots.

And it adds this warning: ""In an extreme case, based on the advice of public health experts, the chief electoral officer could certify that it has become impracticable for Elections Canada to administer the election in one or more electoral districts and recommend to the governor-in-council (the governor general on the advice of cabinet) that the election writ be withdrawn.

""This has never been done in Elections Canada's history.""

It's that warning that particularly worries Blaikie. His nightmare scenario is that the government is defeated or Trudeau chooses to call an election, the governor general duly dissolves Parliament ""and then Elections Canada says, 'We're actually not sure we can do this.'""

""So then you have a dissolved Parliament, you have an executive with no Parliament to hold it to account and how long does that go on? ... If that is a possibility, I think it's one we should all be very concerned about.""

Back on June 25, Blaikie wrote his counterparts in the other federal parties asking that they work together to find a way to ensure an election can be conducted safely during the pandemic with a process that is ""politically legitimate.""

No one has so far responded to his letter.

""I find it kind of shocking that we've got people out there talking really strongly about wanting an election and the conditions under which they would precipitate an election when we don't actually know how to have an election properly right now.""

Higgs predicted Monday that New Brunswick will have little difficulty pulling off a safe election, albeit one in which candidates don't go door-to-door or hand out pamphlets.

With fewer than 200 cases of COVID-19 and just two deaths since March, New Brunswick has been relatively unscathed by the virus, which has infected more than 122,000 and killed more than 9,000 countrywide. Moreover, the pandemic is in something of a lull at the moment - which may no longer be the case later in the fall when the Trudeau government's fate could be on the line.

The province's chief electoral officer, Kim Poffenroth, said her agency has instituted a number of measures to ensure voters' and electoral workers' safety. Among them: marking the floors at polling stations to keep voters at least two-meters apart, requiring the use of hand sanitizer when voters enter and exit polling stations, providing disposable masks to electors, requiring workers to wear masks or face shields and hiring additional workers to manage the flow of voters and to clean high-touch surfaces.

As well, she said Elections New Brunswick has cancelled polling stations in long-term care and seniors' homes and will make it easier for residents in those facilities to vote by mail. It has also stocked up on mail-in ballots.

However, should a second surge of COVID-19 cases erupt before Sept. 14, Poffenroth conceded it could impact voter turnout.

""We may have even greater challenges finding workers to work at the polls and then we may run into problems with the owners of buildings where we're supposed to have polling locations not wanting us to use those locations.""

But regardless of how difficult it might become to administer the election, Poffenroth has no legal authority to recommend that it be called off - unlike Canada's chief electoral officer, Stephane Perrault.

""There's really no playbook for how to do this,"" she said. ""It's a learning curve for both ourselves and other election management bodies across the country and we just happen to be the first ones out the gate.""

The prime minister shared his uncertainty during a news conference on Parliament Hill on Tuesday, only weeks before classes in Ontario and much of the rest of the country are set to resume after being suspended in the spring due to the pandemic.

""Like so many parents, that's something we are in very active discussions on,"" Trudeau said outside the House of Commons, where he announced that Parliament was being prorogued after a small cabinet shuffle.

""We are looking at what the schools' plans are, we're looking at class sizes, we're looking at how the kids are feeling about wearing masks. All my friends as parents are asking these same questions.""

A new survey by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies suggested the majority of parents plan to send their kids to school, but that most would want classes cancelled if there is a new COVID-19 outbreak in their community.

Those results suggested many parents are torn, with 66 per cent of respondents with children saying they were worried about children returning to school but 63 per cent saying they planned to send their kids anyway.

Yet 69 per cent also felt all classes should be suspended and learning shifted back to home if there is a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in their community, with 19 per cent saying classes should continue and 12 per cent unsure either way.

The online survey of 1,510 Canadians over age 18, including 385 parents with school-aged children in their households, took place Aug. 14-16. An internet poll cannot be given a margin of error because it is not a random sample.

The results underscore the nervousness and sensitivities around the planned reopening of school, says Leger president Jean-Marc Leger, with many parents supporting the return of classes but ready to shut it down again at the drop of a hat.

""People are nervous,"" he said. ""It's a very sensitive question.""

For his part, Trudeau said the federal government is making infrastructure money available for provinces to help retrofit schools and other public buildings to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. But he also acknowledged the concern many parents are feeling.

""I know that lots of parents are going to be watching carefully what their local school boards' plans are,"" he said. ""There is a lot of reflection in a lot of households, including mine, as to what's going to happen when September rolls around.""

The Leger survey also found strong support among respondents with children for requiring certain protections to be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at schools, including 76 per cent who said students should have to wear masks.

The result was not broken down by whether masks should be required for only high school students or students in both high school and elementary. Some provinces such as Ontario are requiring masks for students in certain grades but not others.

Eighty-four per cent of respondents with kids said teachers and school staff should be required to wear masks while 75 per cent supported temperature checks for children and 71 per cent wanted screening questionnaires.

""People are saying: 'OK, we agree. We support the government's initiative. But at the same time, you should ensure that the rules are respected at school,'"" said Leger.

Parents were more divided over what to do if a student or teacher in their kid's class tested positive for COVID-19.

While 24 per cent reported they would keep their kids home from school indefinitely, 35 per cent said they would keep them home for at least 14 days while 33 per cent indicated they would follow the advice of their school on next steps.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada has estimated returning sockeye would hit a record low this year, with about 283,000 fish or fewer making it from the ocean to their Fraser River spawning grounds.

Just last month, the department estimated 941,000 sockeye would return, though it noted salmon forecasts were highly uncertain, in part because of a lack of understanding of the effects of warming ocean waters.

The council, made up of the B.C. Assembly of First Nations, the First Nations Summit and Union of B.C. Indian chiefs, says Indigenous communities that rely on the salmon for food face the greatest impacts, but the department has consistently prioritized commercial fishing.

Representatives with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans were not immediately available for comment.

First Nations fishing rights are protected by the Constitution and the council says the federal government has failed in its duty to ensure they have priority access to salmon.

Robert Phillips with the First Nations Summit says Indigenous leaders have been calling on Ottawa to save the salmon for decades and it's time for full jurisdiction over salmon stocks to be transferred back to First Nations.

Five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations on Vancouver Island have also accused federal fisheries officials of systemic racism after the government decided to exclude them in the allocation of 15,000 extra salmon this year — a surplus that arose because fewer people were fishing recreationally during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Salmon returning to the Fraser River also face the added hurdle of making it over a massive landslide along a remote stretch of the river north of Lillooet.

A pneumatic pump and tube system and the construction of a fish ladder have been installed to help salmon over the five-metre waterfall created by the slide.

In an update last week, Fisheries and Oceans said water levels have dropped sufficiently in recent days to allow fish to pass over the slide on their own steam.

A Department of Fisheries document from 2017 says total adult returns of Fraser River sockeye are highly variable ranging from 2 to 28 million, with an average of 9.6 million, between 1980 and 2014.

A year ago children felt safe playing on the street. That isn’t the case anymore, residents say. Some youngsters don’t sleep in their own rooms but in their parents room where it is deemed to be safer.

On Sunday, residents with signs demonstrated at the alley behind Milton Street and more were on the street to raise attention to their continuing concerns, which have continued since mid-March, Natalie Cunliffe, a Milton Street resident, said Monday.

Nanaimo RCMP searched the house in June, arresting two people who were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking. Police found crystal methamphetamine, a small amount of what they suspected was fentanyl, drug paraphernalia and $2,500 in cash.

Last month, Nanaimo council voted unanimously to designate 560 Milton St. a nuisance property. A $250 fine is imposed whenever government officials such as bylaw and police officers are called to the site. The house is in Nob Hill area, on the south side of Nanamo.

After the long-term owner and resident of the Milton Street house died, the ownership and probate were left in control of his brother who lives in Gibsons, Dave LeBerge, Nanaimo’s bylaw services manager, told council. The deceased owner’s roommate was permitted to remain.

But the house was taken over by the street drug culture, turning into a “tremendously busy drug house,” LeBerge said. The city and RCMP received close to 30 complaints from about 15 residences and businesses, he said.

Cunliffe said, “Every day, every hour it impacts us and it has escalated.”

Residents are not sleeping and feel unsafe, she said.

An overgrown vacant property close by is used by people who frequent the house, she said.

People use drugs there, sleep in dugouts and defecate there. “You can imagine the stench,” Cunliffe said.

Two four-hour-long work parties have cut down trees and cleared undergrowth. They use rented power tools and filled in dugouts to remove cover and make the site more open, she said.

A total of 700 pounds of rubbish was removed from the vacant property, she said.

Workers wore heavy boots and thick gloves for protection, Cunliffe said. “We found so many needles. It was amazing.” They were taken to a needle exchange site.

Paul Saroya, who is building a hotel in Nanaimo, owns the vacant lot and said he is a victim of the problems at that property as well.

A development permit application has been submitted to the city for a mixed use rental-commercial project on the site and an adjacent lot. If approved, work could start on the property within two months, he said.

Andrew Homzy, of nearby Hecate Street, is calling on elected officials from all levels of government to take action, saying the people at the drug house are able to run their business with impunity.

“It’s a ridiculous situation.”

The problem with the 110-year-old house may resolve itself because the property is for sale at $295,999. The three-bedroom house is on a 5,049 square foot lot.

Real estate agent Fraser Carmichael said there has been interest in the property. The property permits a carriage home in the back.

The crisis payments for about 58,000 low-income seniors on the B.C. Seniors Supplement were introduced by the province in April, and extended in July and will now continue to pay out four more months until December.

“COVID-19 isn’t going away any time soon,” said Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction Shane Simpson. “Essential costs are increasing in many cases so this is an opportunity to ease that pressure and we see it continuing so we’ll go through December.”

The seniors supplement for a single person is an unfathomably low $49.30 a month, said B.C. seniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie. With the supplement, it becomes $349.30 a month for the lowest-income seniors living on about $19,000 or less a year. For context, a minimum-wage job would bring in about $26,000 a year.

Mackenzie said the boost is substantial and in her mind hasn’t received the attention it’s due.

“It’s very significant for the group of people receiving this money, it’s a lot of money for very low income people,” Mackenzie said.

For a senior couple the supplement would be $120.50 and $49.83 for a spouse receiving the federal Old Age Security allowance.

“We have to find a way to continue to support these really low income seniors after COVID,” said Mackenzie.

“They were struggling before COVID, and they’re going to struggle after COVID and hopefully this will be a catalyst or a way to address this lowest income group of seniors.”

The temporary $300 crisis supplement is extended four months September through December to low-income seniors receiving the B.C. Seniors Supplement and income assistance and disability recipients residing in special care facilities.

The B.C. Senior’s Supplement tops up the federal government’s Old Age Security and/or the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).

The B.C. Seniors Supplement is not available to people who are already receiving federal employment insurance or the $2,000 monthly Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).

No low- or no-income people are still disproportionately affected by this pandemic, said Simpson.

The top up considers that seniors are paying more in prescription dispensing fees, additional travel costs for seniors avoiding public transit due to health concerns, and delivery fees for groceries.

Mackenzie said seniors are also spending more on groceries because they can’t shop around for the best prices as they did prior to the pandemic and seniors who relied on accessing the internet for free at public libraries are now having to order internet services.

Earlier this year, the Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $2.5 billion one-time, tax-free top-up payment to help 6.7 million seniors absorb costs related to COVID-19.

For April to June 2020, the maximum combined payment from OAS plus GIS is $1,514.78. The maximum for OAS is $613.53 OAS and the maximum for GIS is $916.38 GIS per month, for a single person.

The federal one-time lump-sum payment saw seniors who receive Old Age Security in Canada receive a $300 payment. Those who receive the guaranteed income supplement for low-income seniors saw an additional $200.

On Friday night, residents in Saanich’s Panama Flats neighbourhood saw a large gathering of young people hanging out in the street.

Sarah Wakefield, who lives on Carey Road where the crowd congregated, estimated there were at least 100 people.

At first, she could hear the group in the distance, and then they migrated to her street.

“It was a constant stream of kids for an hour,” she said.

Wakefield said she saw one person wearing a mask, but for the most part, people were ignoring public health measures such as physical distancing.

She said she’d never seen or heard of a gathering so large in 20 years living in the area. That it happened during a pandemic worried Wakefield.

“It’s COVID times, so we need to behave in that way,” she said.

Saanich police said the frequency of complaints about large gatherings seems comparable to other years and it’s concerning that some people do not appear to be following public health guidelines designed to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Police said they were initially called about a group of 20 to 30 people near Northridge Elementary School shortly before 11 p.m. Less than 10 minutes later, they received more calls saying the group had grown to more than 100 people, and some were becoming verbally agressive and trying to damage private property.

Officers spoke to some of the people gathered on Carey Road and learned someone had weapons, including a baton and maybe a knife.

Officers were trying to locate the person with weapons, who was believed to be at the school, when they were approached by residents with more information to share.

Police said the group eventually dispersed and officers stayed in the area to speak to residents. They are still investigating and are asking residents with information to provide statements.

Victoria police said they’ve received numerous complaints about large groups who are not practising physical distancing. VicPD spokesman Bowen Osoko said the events have ranged from parties in apartments to a beach rave on Dallas Road a few weeks ago, “complete with DJs, a mirror ball and people openly drinking while they danced together.”

In Oak Bay, problem parties seem to have dissipated since the early days of the pandemic, said Police Chief Ray Bernoties.

“I’m pleased that we don’t seem to be getting those right now. Months ago, there were some concerns expressed about the number of people on the beach but we’re not hearing those concerns much anymore.”

Bernoties said he hopes the change is because people are complying with the guidelines. He noted the District of Oak Bay created a program in May of small outreach teams that provide information on physical distancing guidelines to people on Willows Beach and at Cattle Point.

On Monday, Health Minister Adrian Dix said while outdoor gatherings are more visible, indoor parties pose a greater risk.

Deputy provincial health officer Dr. Reka Gustafson said the number of cases linked to transmission in purely outdoor settings has been “very, very limited.”

“The vast amount of transmission is occurring in close, prolonged contact, especially in indoor settings, so that means among people who are spending a lot of time together and in close proximity,” she said.

Dix and Gustafson emphasized the need to educate and influence people to make safe decisions, rather than punish or shame anyone not following guidelines.

Dix said he spent much of the weekend encouraging young people to engage with their peers about COVID-19.

“I’ve been so inspired by their willingness to do so, by their understanding and their ability to translate some of the things we’re trying to say in a way that works for them, and we need that,” he said, adding the pandemic and “this new normal” is expected to last into 2022. “The way we deal with that as a society inevitably has to be by choice, and by engagement and by talking to each other.”

On occasion, surveillance and enforcement is needed, Dix said, and government ministries met Monday to map out a comprehensive approach to increased enforcement measures and stricter penalties that will come into effect this week.

Solicitor General Mike Farnworth is expected to make an announcement in the coming days.

The credit reporting agency said in a quarterly report that credit card balances fell 12.3 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period a year ago.

Reduced opportunities for spending during the lockdown may have contributed to the drop, said TransUnion's Matt Fabian, but he also noted that people are dipping into savings or retirement funds rather than relying on credit cards.

""Recent feedback from our survey seems like the folks that say they're still experiencing a lot of financial hardship continues to drop. And there's a lot more certainty in terms of the response, in terms of what they're going to do. Consumers have fortified themselves,"" said Fabian.

TransUnion uses the credit bureaus' national consumer credit database as source material for its quarterly report.

Applications for new credit also grew at a slower-than-usual pace amid reduced access to branches during the lockdown, uncertainty around employment and a pullback on new offers from lenders.

The report did note that credit balances for Millennials and Gen Z consumers grew 0.8 per cent and 5.9 per cent, respectively, as those consumers have less buffer in the form of savings, investments or retirement funds. Overall instalment loan debt also rose by 3.9 per cent in the second quarter to $175.4 billion, up from $168.8 billion a year ago.

Mortgage debt is on the rise, TransUnion said, with new mortgages, renewals and refinances up 29 per cent from a year ago and a 5.3 per cent annual increase in the total volume of mortgage debt.

""The spring, that's usually the big mortgage season or the big home buying season. With people not being able to go out, and constraints around travelling and visiting homes and looking at new homes, once some of those lock downs were lifted, we've seen sort of a real surge,"" Fabian said.

""Certainly for some consumers that have existing mortgages, deferrals were an option, and a lot of consumers opted to take it … certainly for a lot of people, a mortgage might be one of the biggest monthly or biweekly expenses that they'd have.""

Despite a 4.3 per cent rise in total outstanding debt in Canada, which stood at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter, Fabian says delinquencies have risen less than expected, as about 2.6 million Canadians, or 9.2 per cent of credit consumers, have at least one active deferral.

Delinquencies also were on the rise for personal loans, which TransUnion noted are ""partly fuelled by alternative lenders who have been slightly more aggressive in issuing personal loans to below prime consumers.""

""We have seen delinquency rates go up a little bit, but a lot less than we had expected… and I think part of that is the deferral and forbearance processes that are in place with the lenders as well as the support from the government,"" said Fabian.

""Delinquency tends to be a long-tail thing where it takes a while. People have exhaust all their options before they will start to continuously skip and miss payments. As deferrals come off and the government subsidization ends, we expect to see some delinquency spike.""

This would also help to ensure that classroom teachers are not laid off in September, due to lower numbers of students returning for in-class learning.

This will help to make social distancing much easier to achieve for the in-class students and teachers, by likely reducing the number of individuals in a classroom.

Telling students who can’t or won’t go back into their classrooms in September – whether it’s due to their own health issues or the health issues of a family member – to sign up for online learning through a distributed-learning program is an insufficient response to the many different realities people are experiencing right now.

Students who don’t feel they can go back into the classroom also don’t want to lose the connection to their school community.

For the teachers who feel too much at risk to consider in-person teaching, they also face being disconnected from their school communities, and from the students with whom they have connections.

As this plan is still coming together, and as we see rising rates of COVID-19, there is still the time and opportunity to take into account the concerns of students, teachers, and parents to determine how we can better establish and maintain the strong community connection that schools deliver for everyone.

A hybrid approach that creates a widened school community moves us towards the two outcomes we should be striving for: Preventing transmission and keeping school communities intact.

Teachers would teach either in-class or online, not both.

This would also help to ensure that classroom teachers are not laid off in September, due to lower numbers of students returning for in-class learning.

The teachers could coordinate their efforts to ensure that grade-level delivery is consistent for the mixed in-class and online cohorts – and even find ways occasionally to bring all of the students into the classrooms via online communication tools, allowing for connection between peers to happen, even if it can’t happen in person.

Having dedicated in-class and online teachers would address the challenges that teachers had in June, as they tried to juggle both at the same time. It would also provide the option for teachers who are in high-risk groups to be able to continue teaching within their established school communities.

Coordination between the two teaching cohorts can be built into the plan: The creation of teacher pods, with some in-school and some online, would further enhance connection and consistency of learning experiences for students.

By having the online cohorts, the pressure on the in-class groups diminishes. This will help to make social distancing much easier to achieve for the in-class students and teachers, by likely reducing the number of individuals in a classroom.

Students who are attending in-person would have the ability to join the online group if they have to stay home because of illness – thereby encouraging students not to come to school if they are unwell, and providing them with uninterrupted instruction while they are home.

Students who are in the online cohort may be able to reconsider between terms of the school year about attending in-person. The teacher cohorts would allow for more ability for mid-year adjustments between the two realms.

The COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable. We need to be flexible and adaptable, keeping in mind the importance of what our long-term goals are: Prevention of transmission and strengthening of community.

The provincial government said Monday that masks will also be required whenever students and teachers are outside their learning groups and cannot maintain an appropriate physical distance because of COVID-19.

Students who can’t wear masks for medical reasons will be exempt from the updated health and safety guidelines.

Even when wearing masks, staff and students will still have to maintain a physical distance from people outside of their learning groups, the province said.

Learning groups are made up of students and staff who remain together through a school quarter, semester or year. They were established on the advice of the provincial health officer to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19 and could be made up of a single class of students or multiple classes.

Réka Gustafson, B.C.’s deputy provincial health officer, said masks are “quite low are the hierachy” of protections for COVID-19.

“That’s why they are limited to brief periods of time when other control methods cannot be used.”

She said the most effective way to prevent transmission of the virus is for people to stay home when they are sick. “We know we can add an important additional layer of protection by keeping our groups small, which is what the learning groups are about.”

The use of masks will be evaluated to make sure students and children are able to use them safely and determine whether they prove beneficial, Gustafson said.

The government said would provide additional funding to schools to help pay for the purchase of up to 1.5 million non-medical masks. It said the funding would provide for at least two masks for every staff member and student at the province’s public schools.

The mask requirement was part of updated guidelines for schools released by the province on Monday.

In addition to the updated guidelines on the use of masks, the government said it is increasing the cleaning of such things as doorknobs, keyboards, desks and chairs.

As well, students, staff and visitors will be required to clean their hands before boarding school buses or entering schools. Hands will also have to be cleaned before and after eating, when using washrooms and using playground equipment.

Sooke superintendent Scott Stinson said the school district welcomes the additional direction.

“As a district, we are appreciative that the ministry is responding to and reflecting the concerns of the community,” he said. “Having greater clarity on when and where masks will be most beneficial is helpful for our planning and work.”

Students are scheduled to return to class on Sept. 10.

School districts have until Friday to submit their restart plans to the ministry for approval. They will be reviewed before the districts share the details with families on Aug. 26.

The Cowichan Valley school district said it has made progress in preparing for the return of students and will have its teachers in place Sept. 8 for a series of planning days.

The planning days will allow staff to meet with their school-based health and safety teams, finalize planning for the year, and adjust to the enhanced health and safety procedures before students return, the district said.

“We are carefully and thoughtfully working our way toward a localized return-to-school plan that will help all students and staff have a safe and productive school year,” said Candace Spilsbury, chair of the board of education for the school district.

“Schools are safe places — by following the updated health and safety guidelines from the Ministry of Education and provincial health officer, we can ensure they will stay that way.”"

Deputy Chief Howard Chow says the street was closed to vehicles to make more room for pedestrians, and some ""would-be DJs"" set up speakers.

He says it drew a crowd, but officers were able to break it up.

Video of the party was shared on social media, and appeared to show a crowd of people dancing in close quarters.

Chow says groups of people have been congregating around music or buskers outside because there aren't many indoor options available during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The trend has prompted celebrities to respond to a plea from Premier John Horgan for help with messaging to younger residents about partying during the pandemic.

Vancouver-born actor and comedian Seth Rogen tweeted on Saturday that the ""people of British Columbia"" should forego parties, barbecues and other gatherings in favour of more low-key activities.

""It's more fun to hang out alone and smoke weed and watch movies and TV shows anyway!"" he wrote. ""Do that instead!""

British Columbia has seen a rise in cases over the past week, reporting 85, 78 and 84 new cases on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday respectively.

Previously, actor Ryan Reynolds lent his voice to the cause.

On Friday he posted a voice recording on Twitter, framed as a voicemail left for Horgan, warning B.C.'s younger residents of the dangers of COVID-19.

""Young folks in B.C., they're partying, which is of course dangerous,"" he said in the recording. ""They probably don't know that thousands of young people aren't just getting sick of coronavirus, they're dying of it too.""

He urged them not to kill some of B.C.'s coolest residents — including David Suzuki and Reynold's mom.

""Let's not kill anyone,"" he said. ""I think that's reasonable.""

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said Thursday that people between the ages of 20 and 29 now make up the group seeing the largest increase of infections.

As of Friday, 4,358 people in British Columbia had tested positive for the virus, the majority of whom have recovered. Public health officials have recorded 196 deaths linked to the virus.

The initial campaign to suppress the spread was so successful it left the impression the pandemic could be beaten.

It can’t.

It’s a highly-contagious virus that spread all over the world in a few short weeks. It’s persistent, sneaky and relentless. Without a vaccine, the idea of eradicating such a virulent plague is a lost cause.

The best to be hoped for is that the infection rate can be managed to stay below the limits of health resources. That was the thrust from the beginning of the message to bend the curve.

No one ever promised to drive the curve down to zero. But it flat-lined for so long it looks like people started assuming the crisis was over and B.C. could carry on indefinitely with a paltry handful of new cases a day.

So there’s consternation since the case count started escalating in July, to the point where it bounced back to near record highs this week. There were 84 new cases Friday, the third day in a row that has matched the sky-high levels in March.

The saving grace is that the profile of the pandemic seems to have changed. Far greater numbers of younger people are testing positive comparatively, and they don’t get as sick.

So the hospitalization rate — 12 patients as of Friday — remains far below the level that would send the health care system to condition red.

Twenty-somethings are getting it at twice the rate they were in the spring and that age group now has the largest number of cases. The renewed concern about the case count has prompted some calls to restore the restrictions that were imposed in the spring and relaxed in two phases through May and June.

But the increase in cases was expected when the re-start of the economy began. It’s literally the cost of doing business.

“No surprise,” provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said this week. “As we knew, as we started to increase and open up and move into our restart phases, we were going to see more cases.”

The modeling shows that slamming more restrictions back in place would curb the caseload. But the government intends to resist any thought of renewing restrictions, unless it becomes unavoidable. The economic destruction and resulting job loss looks to have reached the point where government sees returning to more stringent restrictions as a last-ditch option.

Another reason lies in the new analyses this week confirming the obvious: Lower socio-economic groups are having a harder time coping.

While Henry manages the epidemiology, politicians are dealing with demands for hundreds of millions of dollars more in aid and reports of thousands of businesses closing.

Premier John Horgan spent Friday in a sometimes-testy debate with Opposition Leader Andrew Wilkinson on the government’s economic response.

Wilkinson highlighted unemployment statistics, business closures and the upcoming deadlines to pay billions in taxes that were deferred earlier in the year. Horgan said the official economic response plan — worth $1.5 billion — is due to be released in early September. The government plans to be as flexible as possible with companies that can’t pay taxes at the end of September, he said.

The reluctance to clamp down again and the determination to open schools suggests B.C. is nearing the limits of assistance. The emphasis will be on reacting to new cases under current protocols, with tactics like 500 new contract tracers soon to be hired.

Henry said that will “ensure that we can continue with our restart.” They’ll do so in the face of modeling that predicts “the number of new cases may continue to increase this summer.”

The escalation stems from something that’s always been a given, but never been made clearer. It’s the innate human need to socialize. People can close themselves off from contact for a brief period of time, but then they have to go out and mingle with others. The pandemic has revealed the strength of that drive, even when it’s foolhardy and potentially lethal to do so. It’s another reason why going back to stricter limits is being resisted.

What if people just ignore them?

Pandher, who lives near Whitehorse, has been dancing and travelling his way across Vancouver Island over the past week trying to spread a message of positivity during COVID-19.

""(The pandemic) created a lot of pressure and stresses. Some people are sharing it, some people are not, but everybody is feeling it ... I'd like to say be happy, be hopeful, even though it's hard,"" Pandher said in an interview.

He rose to fame with a series of viral videos showcasing his bhangra skills, dancing alongside members of the Canadian Armed Forces, local politicians and first responders.

Bhangra is a lively form of dance to music, originating from the Punjab region in India and characterized by leaps, kicks and arm movement.

""Bhangra has a lot of elements of positivity and happiness, and it's very high-energy,"" Pandher said. ""It's a workout dance, it's a happy dance, it brings people together.""

Pandher has been practising bhangra most of his life, punctuated by small breaks every now and then, but he's recently turned it into a full-time job, teaching it online to help those feeling cooped up due to the pandemic.

""Many professionals, doctors, high commissioners, politicians, they were taking these classes. I was quite touched,"" he said.

Yukon imposed COVID-19 border restrictions when the pandemic first hit, but opened its border to B.C. in July, prompting a vacation idea from Pandher.

""Vancouver Island is kind of like the Yukon. It's known for its wilderness, its natural beauty, the people and also the great thing is that both areas are remote,"" he said, clarifying that while not as remote as Yukon, Vancouver Island still had an ocean separating it from its mainland neighbours.

That separation was part of the reason for the holiday choice, as Pandher believes it helps protect it from COVID-19 outbreaks.

It's not the dance instructor's first visit to the island.

He previously visited the Canadian Armed Forces base in Esquimalt, leading 15 members in a bhangra session.

He said he's been stopped and visited by fans during this most recent trip, with a particular highlight being a visit and dance session with firefighters in Nanaimo and an attempt to surf at Tofino.

""It's just like dancing bhangra,"" Pander said of surfing. ""In bhangra you need to co-ordinate a lot of movements to put it together — same with surfing: balance, co-ordination — and just being on the beach and in the water was awesome.""

Pandher is scheduled to leave B.C. on Sunday but hopes to come back again in the future.

“If I pass 80 I’m going to call it Nudging 90.”kderosa@timescolonist.com","Anne Patton, 78, has done more things in the last year than most people have done in a lifetime. She endured -40C temperatures while dog sledding in Churchill, Man., trudged through waist-deep snow while snowshoeing, zoomed across a zip line and glided across — and fell into — a calm lake while stand-up paddle boarding.

Her list of adventures will unfold over the next two years as the Saanich-based children’s author aims to do 80 new things before she turns 80. Her personal project, dubbed “Embracing Eighty” and chronicled on her Facebook page, is about getting the most out of life and staying young at heart.

“I figure that as long as you’re living on this earth, you should be alive,” said Patton, who moved to Victoria with her husband in 2011 after a long career as an elementary school teacher in Regina. “My idea as a teacher was to instill passion for life. I want to be an example of living in the moment and enjoying the moment.”

Patton was inspired by a fellow writer who was trying 60 new things before she turned 60. Patton started last year just after her 77th birthday. “I thought to myself: ‘If I’m doing 80 things, I better start now.’ “

Many of the activities are done with her grandsons Seamus, 12, and Jasper, 10, who have watched her pull crabs from a crab trap, float in the ocean on a giant swan and traverse a metal tight rope and rope ladders while harnessed high up in the trees at the aerial adventure park Wild Play.

Patton doesn’t have a set list of 80 things, she’s just embracing experiences as they come to her. And she’s open to suggestions.

Some of her plans, for example taking a hot air balloon ride or going on a Segway tour, have been scuttled because of COVID-19 travel restrictions.

“I was planning to go to Scotland, you know, have some far out adventures, but I’m stuck here on the Island,” she joked. Nonetheless, new adventures seem to find her, often unexpectedly. During a family trip to Cowichan Bay in July, Patton told the on-site manager of her rented beach house that she was running out of ideas for her project.

His first suggestions — skydiving and bungy — were quickly shot down by Patton, who says she has her limits.

“He said, ‘oh, well how about a Harley Davidson ride?’ Well, that sounded so tame in comparison to skydiving that I said ‘oh sure.’ “

Patton worried she didn’t have “any of the right clothes to look bad ass.”

The man’s wife stepped in and outfitted Patton in black leather boots, a black motorcycle jacket and black helmet. “I looked like Darth Vader and sounded like him too.”

Patton jumped on the back of the Harley and was whisked away to Bowser and back. She pitched the idea of carrying on to Port Hardy but her escort had to get back to work.

Patton’s friends told her she was crazy when she said she wanted to go to Churchill, Man. in early March. Undeterred, she ticked off at least six adventures up there, including snowshoeing, dog sledding, and visiting Sloop Cove where 18th century Hudson’s Bay fur traders etched their names into some of the Earth’s oldest bedrock. There, she describes giant ice ridges pushed up by the tide “like grotesque sea monsters trying to crawl out from under the water.”

That sheltered nook on the west side of the Churchill River will be one of the settings in Patton’s upcoming young adult novel about the forced evictions of people living in the Scottish Highlands, called the Highland Clearances, beginning in the mid-18th century.

Patton said her spontaneity and try-it-all-once attitude keep her young and close to her five grandchildren, aged 12 to 21.

“They’re young, spunky people. I don’t want to look like an old fogey. I want to be someone they remember fondly.”

Patton hopes that after she dies, her grandkids will laugh as they share memories and say: “Remember how crazy Nana was?”

Patton turns 80 on March 1, 2022. She’s not worried if she doesn’t find 80 things by then.

She figures she’ll have to keep going anyways because she wants to see the solar eclipse which is set for October 2023. “If I pass 80 I’m going to call it Nudging 90.”

The daycare operator could not be reached to comment on whether the delay in opening the doors was due to the residential tenancy dispute, but the landlord says that’s the case.
A daycare is zoned for residential use, not commercial use, so it has just as much right to the common spaces as other tenants, Cox said.
He said prior to leasing to the daycare, the common spaces were hardly used by tenants.
He offered to cover the moving costs and the tenant’s rent would remain the same even if the unit was slightly more expensive.","The laughs and cries of children playing is the source of a dispute between tenants of a downtown rental building and their landlord.

Some tenants of a 134-unit purpose-built rental building on the corner of Cook Street and Pandora Avenue are upset that a new daycare, set to open next month, will take over some of their common space during weekdays and are worried about the noise of children playing on playgrounds. The landlord says the daycare is part of his goal of creating a family-friendly rental building in a city where new child-care spaces are desperately needed.

article continues below

A recent residential tenancy board decision was split down the middle, finding that sharing the common space does not impinge on the tenants’ ability to live in their suite, but that the landlord did not give proper notice or a rent reduction to the tenants about the new restrictions to the common areas.

Danica Jeffery and her five-year-old son have lived in a two-bedroom apartment at 1488 Cook St. for two years, drawn by the fact that the 13-storey building is pet-friendly and has a large sun deck on the 11th floor and a playground just steps away. Jeffery pays $2,100-a-month in rent for a second-floor apartment.

Jeffery said she’s fine that a daycare has moved into the building’s 4,400-square foot commercial space on the ground floor, but she’s upset that, for six hours a day Monday to Friday, kids will be playing on equipment that takes up a large chunk of the second floor and 11th- floor common patio spaces. “It’s 100 per cent unnecessary that [the daycare] has use of residential common areas,” she said.

Jeffery, a communications specialist in her early 40s, works from home. She worries that when groups of kids are in the playground, she’ll have to keep her windows closed and blinds drawn to get peace and privacy.

“It will be a constant stream of fresh lungs, yelling and laughing, and that’s great, but not right outside my home,” she said. Maple Tree Children’s Centre, which signed a 10-year lease for the 76-space daycare, was expected to open in July, but its opening has been delayed to September. The daycare operator could not be reached to comment on whether the delay in opening the doors was due to the residential tenancy dispute, but the landlord says that’s the case.

Mands Burnette, who lives on the second floor with her husband, Andrew Poucher, and their six-year-old son, Arlo, said she’s upset by the lack of consultation with tenants about the daycare.

During parent tours of the daycare and construction of new fencing, there was a steady stream of people passing by her patio windows, taking away her privacy, she said.

“We’re all reasonable people, we all get it, I don’t think anyone has a problem with the daycare occupying the commercial space,” said Burnette, 36. “It’s good that Victoria is having more daycare spaces, but I don’t think using the residential spaces is good for anybody.”

Both tenants say they’re in the dark about the daycare’s COVID-19 safety practices, such as where parents will pick up and drop off, and whether they will use the elevators.

Landlord Steven Cox of Cox Developments said he did not anticipate the backlash to renting the ground-floor commercial space to a daycare or letting the daycare use the second- and 11th-floor common spaces as play areas. “I love families. I love kids laughing. To me that’s the most beautiful sound in the world. So it kind of shocked me that young people would be so concerned,” he said.

Standing next to the building’s giant chalkboard where tenants can leave messages and kids can doodle, Cox said he wanted to design a rental building focused on families. He estimates there are 30 kids living in the building.

Cox said the people living closest to the play areas have a “legitimate beef,” but he’s asking tenants to wait until the daycare opens to make a judgment on noise. “I don’t think a bunch of four-year-olds will be that noisy,” said Cox, noting he had three boys who are now adults.

A daycare is zoned for residential use, not commercial use, so it has just as much right to the common spaces as other tenants, Cox said. He said prior to leasing to the daycare, the common spaces were hardly used by tenants. Cox has plans to add an outdoor barbecue and more seating to the patio areas so, he said, the common areas will be enhanced, not diminished.

Burnette and five other tenants filed a dispute with the Residential Tenancy Branch, arguing that they weren’t given proper notice about the daycare and that they should be given a rent reduction for losing access to common spaces when the daycare is in operation.

Burnette surveyed tenants about the daycare and said of 44 who replied, a majority expressed concerns about potential noise and lack of consultation.

According to the Residential Tenancy Act, a landlord may restrict a service such as a common area as long as they give 30 days’ written notice and reduce the rent in an amount equivalent to the reduction in value of losing such service. In a July 30 decision, the arbitrator found that the tenants continue to have access to the common spaces when they’re not being used by the daycare.

“I find that the landlord’s restriction on the tenants’ access to these common areas does not make it impossible or impractical for the tenants to use their rental units as a living accommodation,” the arbitrator wrote. “Should the landlord wish to continue with their intent to restrict the facilities, they are still required to ensure that the tenants’ right to quiet enjoyment is not impacted.”

The arbitrator found that the landlord’s written notice on June 3 about the daycare was not given on the approved form. Cox reissued the notice form at the end of July and gave tenants a rent reduction of between $15 and $30 a month depending on how close they are to the playground.

Cox said he has tried to accommodate any tenants who are upset, offering to move them to another unit farther away from the play areas. He offered to cover the moving costs and the tenant’s rent would remain the same even if the unit was slightly more expensive.

Burnette said she declined the offer to move to another suite because she would have to sign a 13-month lease. She’s now on a month-to-month lease which allows her to move if the noise from the daycare is too much.

Jeffery said as a single mother, she can’t afford to move to another building if the daycare proves too disruptive. “I just feel like my hands are tied and I just have to sit down and suffer.”

Cox has urged tenants to be patient and said if there are any issues after the daycare opens, he will address them. “I honestly don’t think anyone is going to be hurt by it. I hope this building gets a reputation of being a family-friendly building.”

Burnette and Jeffery both expect they’ll be back before the Residential Tenancy Branch again if their fears around noise are realized.

“When I pulled myself out of the car, I lost it,” Vernon, 21, said. “I’m surprised I didn’t die today.”

The Sooke couple were travelling south in the direction of Langford when their vehicle was struck by a truck which was making a left turn from Whittaker Road onto the Malahat, just north of the Shawnigan Lake exit.

“I looked down to change a song on the radio and when I looked up I saw the truck directly in front of us,” said Vernon, who was sitting in the front passenger seat of the Honda.

“Next thing I know, we were spinning and hitting things. It felt like we were crashing forever. We ended up on the median.”

The Ford truck hit the Honda on its passenger side, near where Vernon was seated. The air bags did not deploy, Pollitt said. Two ground-ambulance crews were dispatched to the scene at 8:30 a.m, according to B.C. Emergency Health Services. The couple received treatment from paramedics on the scene before being transferred by ambulance to Victoria General Hospital.

Pollitt, 25, who was driving, was relatively unharmed but Vernon suffered several injuries in the crash, including a broken clavicle.

The passenger side window shattered during the crash, sending small shards into Vernon’s eyes, which is being treated with medication. “The whole right side of my body is cut up,” she said.

It could have been far worse. Vernon was just doing up her seatbelt at the time of the crash. (Pollitt had stopped moments before, so she could use a bathroom).

But the car is now a write-off due to the extensive damage, Vernon said. “It looks like we were in a garbage compactor. The whole side is ripped open. I looked at it once I got out, and thought: ‘Holy [expletive]. I can’t believe we were in that.’ “

Lieut. Gerry Lacquement of the Malahat Volunteer Fire Department, whose station is located at 935 Whittaker Rd., less than one kilometre from where the crash happened, was on the scene within minutes.

He joined two separate passersby — one of whom was a nurse, the other an industrial first-aid attendant — who had stopped minutes earlier to offer help. “Sometimes you luck out and get good people who happen upon the scene,” Lacquement said.

He arrived to find the Honda facing the wrong direction. After impact, the vehicle had been spun around and was deposited onto the safety barrier, facing north.

“It turns out they were going southbound, but the vehicle was facing opposite their direction of travel.”

The crash took place just north of the oft-discussed Shawnigan Lake Road exit, a section of the highway that has received extensive safety upgrades in recent years.

But the Malahat as a whole has long been a concern for Vernon, who said several friends have been in crashes in the vicinity.

A friend of her father, who lived with the Vernon family when she was young, died on the highway the day he received his motorcycle licence 13 years ago.

“The amount of friends I’ve had die on the Malahat, who haven’t made it through those crashes, is insane,” she said.

“At least I made it, though.”

The BC Wildfire Service said crews are responding to the fire on Christie Mountain about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, on the east side of Skaha Lake.

The fire is estimated at 250 hectares and firefighters on the ground are being supported by air tankers.

The service said the situation was ""rapidly evolving"" and asked everyone to stay clear of the area to avoid interfering with the operation.

The order asks residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with pets and critical items.

""We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,"" the service said in a tweet.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a ""fire of note"" on Tuesday.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was smouldering with no open flame but was considered out of control. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight.

Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Firefighters have tackled dozens of wildfires after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions.

Two fires were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.

Chrystia Freeland, who was sworn in Tuesday afternoon after Bill Morneau resigned late Monday, will have to manage a COVID-19 recovery that is still very much under way, with more than 40 per cent of the three million workers who lost jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic still unemployed as of mid-July.

The path forward for jobless Canadians is still taking shape. Fewer than one-third of the 4.7 million people who were receiving the $2,000-per-month Canada Emergency Response Benefit at the beginning of August would qualify for Employment Insurance when CERB ends on Sept. 26, according to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, though the government has promised to ease EI eligibility rules.

The unemployment rate currently sits at 10.9 per cent, according to Statistics Canada's July labour force survey, which noted almost twice as many people were unemployed than in February.

Meanwhile, the spectre of protectionism continues to loom large after U.S. President Donald Trump reimposed tariffs on Canadian aluminum earlier this month — Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden also harbours protectionist sentiments — further complicating trade relationships.

Key to the task of drafting a budget will be weighing whether to patch up a frayed social safety net or to broaden it with reinforced rope.

""There are huge challenges in terms of how our social safety net has actually been exposed through COVID to be kind of thin and narrow,"" said Sheila Block, a senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.

""Years and years of underinvestment in public services have really come back to bite us.""

Potential changes to employment insurance — thresholds for hours worked, payment amounts and inclusion of self-employed and gig economy workers — fall under the purview of the employment minister, ""but eventually it lands on the finance minister,"" Block said.

Debt presents another dilemma for Freeland. Ottawa has been pumping money into the economy since March, resulting in a projected debt of $343 billion, an increase of more than 1,000 per cent from the previous year.

Much of that spending has gone toward a federal wage subsidy for troubled businesses, which has been extended until at least December. Further extensions and tweaks to the program — it will cost the government an estimated $67.9 billion through the end of the year, according to a report last week by the Parliamentary Budget Office — will rest largely in Freeland's hands.

Fiscal policy is already running ""at full throttle,"" said Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter, with the 2020-21 federal debt-to-GDP ratio headed about 49 per cent compared to 31 per cent currently.

The longer-term issue is whether the surge in spending linked to the coronavirus will morph into a more permanent trend, with attendant tax and debt implications, he said.

Despite a drastic uptick, the debt-to-GDP ratio remains well below danger zones highlighted by the International Monetary Fund and the highs of the mid-1990s, when it reached two-thirds.

Interest rates are also at historic lows, which means the borrowed cash comes cheap.

Morneau's resignation could portend a doubling down on a ""'fairness' agenda,"" with ""more fiscal activism"" the likely outcome, said Derek Holt, vice-president at Scotiabank Economics.

""The timing works well, as resigning in August gives plenty of time for a material shift in the fiscal stance before the unconfirmed fall budget or update and Throne Speech,"" Holt said in a research note.

The Business Council of Canada on Tuesday urged the government to set clear fiscal targets and rein in spending given a projected net debt in 2020-21 of $1.2 trillion, saying in a letter to Freeland that ""interest rates will rise eventually.""

CEO Goldy Hyder said there is an ""urgent need"" for Ottawa to pivot to an ""economic growth and prosperity agenda,"" with an eye to structural issues ranging from an aging population and climate change to ""regulatory obstacles that go well beyond pipelines.""

Freeland brings to the table a background steeped in financial journalism — she penned the 2012 book ""Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else"" — and delicate trade negotiations with the U.S. during her nearly two-year stint as foreign affairs minister.

""Her communication skills and prior background as a financial journalist and policy wonk will serve her well in the role as will her global mindset. Freeland could well be the country’s best — if not only — chance at a female prime minister within a reasonable time horizon,"" Holt said.

Some previous finance ministers have landed in the role after prominent business careers, including Morneau and Paul Martin, but others such as Jean Chretien, Jim Flaherty and John Manley took on the title without any executive experience.

""Being a titan of industry in particular in these times is not necessarily the best qualification for a finance minister,"" Block said, citing inequality and the pandemic as the towering economic issues of the day.

""I think there’s a great deal of uncertainty, and that’s something that the finance minister will also have to deal with.""

An index is a select number of stocks listed on an exchange. These selected stocks are typically designed to provide an approximation of the performance of the broad index. This means that each index is typically within one country or one geographic area, and some countries have numerous indices. It is important to note that not all indices are valued the same way.

The key for most investors is to determine which index is the closest benchmark to gauge their overall stock market performance. Indices provide us a system of measuring change that can be documented and reported in the newspaper, radio, internet and television. Investors should use caution when looking at this information to make investment decisions and to monitor their own portfolio. Let’s start by first obtaining an understanding of the major indices used around the world.

To assist you in obtaining a better understanding of the various “equity” benchmarks, we have included a few points below, sorted geographically.

United States and Canada

If you have equities within your portfolio, then chances are one, or more, of the four indices below could be a benchmark you could look at periodically.

• Dow Jones Industrial Average (US): Consists of the 30 largest and most widely held public companies in the United States.

• S&P 500 Index (US): S&P stands for Standard & Poor’s, and this Index consists of just over 500 large companies, most of which are American.

• NASDAQ Composite Index (US): NASDAQ stands for National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System, and this Index is made up of over 3,300 companies.

• S&P/TSX Composite Index (Canada): TSX (formerly TSE), stands for Toronto Stock Exchange, and this Index consists of approximately 231 large companies as measured by market capitalization, all of which are Canadian.

If you have expanded your portfolio beyond Canada and the United States then we have summarized a few points of other major indices around the world below.

Americas

• IPC Index (Mexico) is a market capitalization weighted index containing 35 companies.

• Bovespa Index (Brazil) isbest known as Ibovesa and is comprised of the most liquid stocks traded on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange. This Index has a broad range of companies.

Europe

• Euro Stoxx 50 (Eurozone) is a European Index for the Eurozone, holding 50 of the largest and most liquid stocks from 9 countries within the Eurozone.

• FTSE 100 Index (United Kingdom) is a market capitalization weighted index representing the performance of the 100 largest UK-domiciled companies. FTSE stands for Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange.

• CAC 40 Index (France) consists of 40 large French companies as listed on Euronext Paris.

• DAX Index (Germany) consists of the 30 large German companies trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

• IBEX 35 Index (Spain)iscomprised of 35 large Spanish companies traded on the Bolsa de Madrid which is Spain’s primary stock exchange.

• FTSE MIB Index (Italy)consists of 40 large Italian companies traded on Borsa Italiana’s (BIt) MTA market.

• AEX Index (Netherlands)iscomposed of Dutch companies that trade on Euronext Amsterdam and is comprised of a maximum of 25 of the most actively traded securities on the exchange.

• OMX Stockholm 30 Index (Sweden) is a market value weighted index that consists of the 30 most-traded stock classes.

Largest Company in Canada

Over the years, we have seen several companies become Canada’s largest company by market capitalization. Few investors can forget the rise of Nortel Networks. It had become so large in August 2000 that it was more than ten times the size of the second largest company in Canada.

Research in Motion became the most valuable company in Canada in October 2007. Remember when natural gas prices spiked and Encana became the largest company in September of 2005? How about Valeant Pharmaceuticals? This stock became the largest company in Canada by market capitalization in July 2015.

On May 6, 2020, Shopify overtook Royal Bank of Canada to become Canada’s most valuable company. It remains to be seen if Shopify will continue its dominance or if it will suffer a similar fate to its predecessors.

What is a Market Weight Index?

There are a couple of different terms used such as “market value-weighted index” and “capitalization-weighted index” that mean the same thing as a market weighted index. Essentially, with a market weighted index, a security’s weighting is based according to the total market capitalization of the security. This means that larger capitalization securities will have a higher weighting percentage in the index and have a greater influence on the index as the price of the security rises or falls.

Let’s take a look at the TSX Composite Index which is a market weighted index. On January 1, 2020, the TSX started the year at 17,063.43 and was at 16,169.21 as of July 31, 2020 – a decline of 5.24 per cent.

In that same time period the top point contributor to the index was Shopify which contributed 637.75 points. Barrick Gold was the second top point contributor adding 187.88 points to the index.

As noted above, Shopify has become the biggest stock in Canada. If you were to take Shopify out of the index then the index would be down 10.56 per cent. This shows how much one security can influence an index in a market-weighted index.

What is a “Capped” Index?

If you are following an index that has the word “Capped” in it, then they will put an upper limit on the weight of any single security. For example, you can monitor the S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index which restricts the weighting of any security to a maximum of 10 per cent. Another example of a capped index is the SWISS Market Index which capped its weighting at 18 per cent in 2017 to address some of the larger capitalized stocks such as Nestle and Novartis.

What is an Equal Weight Index?

An equal-weighted index is comprised of a group of companies. The index holds an equal dollar amount in each stock. Each company’s stock carries equal importance in determining the performance and total value of the index. Many market-weighted indices will have an equal weight index equivalent. For example, the S&P 500 Index has an equal weighted version where it takes all the constituents of the S&P 500 Index and assigns an equal weight to each.

Let’s look at how the S&P 500 Index and its equal weighted counterpart compare.

Similar to the market-weighted S&P/TSX Composite Index, a few large companies can have a huge influence on the performance of the index.

On January 1, 2020, the S&P 500 Index started the year at 3,230.78 and was at 3,271.12 as of July 31, 2020, an increase of 1.25 per cent. Three of the largest capitalized companies on the index contributed 176.84 points to the index (Amazon +66.33 points, Apple +66.10 points, and Microsoft +44.41 points). If you look at the equal weighted version of the S&P 500 then you have a much different story. Using the same time period of January 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020 the equal weighted S&P 500 Index posted a decline of 7.60 per cent.

In our next article, we will discuss how some investors use these indices as part of their investment strategy.

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

""After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,"" Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal's three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first overall by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

""A low-maintenance superstar,"" said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg's senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At five foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn't blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack of getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday. ""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League. I think it was Dale's arrival that really cemented the future of the franchise and I think we all have recollections of that first year, that Calder (Trophy) year and then everything that would follow.

""He was truly a superstar as a hockey player, but I think why he was so loved here was not just that but largely the fact that he made this his home and became one of us. I think everybody shared that sense of pride in Dale's career as a player.""

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: ""All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL's all time greatest players.""

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

""What an incredible human being,"" Selanne tweeted.

Montreal Canadiens associate coach Kirk Muller also had a chance to speak with Hawerchuk in recent days.

""I talked to Dale a few days ago, and we had a good chance to chat. A good friend, had a real good opportunity to play against one of the all-time best players. As a hockey player, we all know how great he was, but he was a good friend and just a really special person, did a lot for charities. It's a real loss for us in the hockey world.""

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk ""one of the most decorated players in our game's history.""

In September 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

""For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I'm ready to fight it,"" he told TSN in October 2019. ""I want to live to tell the story.""

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie's bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames players Andrew Mangiapane and Rasmus Andersson remembered playing for Hawerchuk in Barrie.

""I don't know where I'd be without him,"" said Mangiapane. ""Very sad news today. I owe my career basically to him and the whole Barrie organization.""

Andersson, from Sweden, said ""Dale was a fantastic human being. Such a great person. My first week in Barrie he invited us over to his house and really just welcomed me to Canada. I cannot say enough good things about him as a person. Obviously a real good coach, too.""

""It's awful news.""

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday's opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at age two and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur's record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

""I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive — well maybe a little further now with the traffic,"" he said. ""I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""

""I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,"" he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and '81 with teammates that included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL's top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt like he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year — the youngest recipient at the time — and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

""Just one of the greatest. You could tell from day one. We knew from when he was 18 years old as a player that he would turn the (Jets) franchise around. Certainly one of the best I’ve ever played with and coached,"" said Dallas Stars coach Rick Bowness, who played with and coached Hawerchuk in the '80s.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

""He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,"" said Mike Doran, Winnipeg's director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the faceoff in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux's famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

""It turned out fantastic,"" said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada's call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets ""are etched in my mind every day that I live.""

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes' ring of honour.

Hawerchuk re-wrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia whom he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

""It's like going back down memory lane,"" he said in his induction speech.

""All the experiences have been fantastic,"" he added. ""I mean, sometimes they didn't feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing ... Even though I didn't win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn't change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.""

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets' Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November 2017.

""Tonight we fly Ducky's number high,"" said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue's ""Home Sweet Home,"" before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

""Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,"" said the PA announcer.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

""I've been to every part of (Manitoba), either golfing or playing (softball),"" Hawerchuk said. ""I've gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I'm honoured and I'm very humbled.""

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.

The CFL cancelled the 2020 campaign Monday after its quest for a $30-million, interest-free loan from Ottawa fell through. The league said it needed financial assistance from the federal government to stage an abbreviated season.

Bighill and Mitchell, in separate media availabilities Tuesday, offered very similar opinions on what the cancellation could mean for the league. Bighill, a middle linebacker, helped the Winnipeg Blue Bombers capture the Grey Cup last year after quarterback Mitchell guided the Calgary Stampeders to the '18 CFL title.

""This is a good opportunity for us to strengthen,"" Bighill said during a conference call that also involved Bombers quarterback Zach Collaros. ""We need to build a better relationship (between) the CFLPA and CFL as far as how well we're communicating and build a real relationship that we can move forward on.

""Randy (CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie) has said multiple times the business model has been broken so how do we fix it? Those are things that need to be addressed and we've got time to do that.""

Mitchell agreed.

""I just want to see the CFL and CFLPA work together in a more unified sense,"" Mitchell said. ""I think right now we can just come together and really find a way to make the CFL better, not just for 2021 . . . but the next 50 years, for guys who are going to come after us.

""I think this is a good chance to do it, so whatever that looks like I'm all for it.""

The CFL and CFLPA have had a sometimes acrimonious relationship, especially during collective bargaining talks. But the two sides were said to be close to having an amended CBA that would've allowed for a season to be played with federal funding.

But even that wasn't an entirely smooth process. In June, CFLPA executive director Brian Ramsey took to Twitter to express his frustration that the union hadn't heard from the league regarding its 2020 plans.

""We really didn't an offer to sit at the table and talk until June and then we really didn't get to look at a collective bargaining agreement until July,"" Bighill said. ""There could've been a lot of things, I think, that could've been done earlier.

""We need to work better together as a league and player reps and players union to make this product better.""

Collaros and Bighill played big roles in the Bombers downing the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 33-12 for their first Grey Cup title since 1990. Collaros was looking forward to defending that championship this year.

""I don't know if you win the championship in 2019 and 2021 if that counts as back-to-back,"" Collaros said. ""Man, it's really disappointing not to be able to get on the field and defend that title this year.""

A shortened CFL season would've been held in Winnipeg, the league's tentative hub city. In April, Collaros and his wife, Nicole, became first-time parents and although playing football would've meant being away from his family in a CFL bubble, Collaros was committed to suiting up for a 2020 campaign.

""It definitely would've been a conversation to have with my wife but I think we were both aligned on the same page that I was going to play,"" he said. ""We need to make money, that's the bottom line.

""I guess it's a good thing we don't have to have the conversation but at the same time you put a lot of work in to get ready for the season, physically and mentally. To have that kind of taken away and be strung along for months was not fun.""

Many CFL players will have to find alternate sources of income. Mitchell considers himself lucky as he received a signing bonus from Calgary as part of a restructured contract in December.

Mitchell, twice the CFL's most outstanding player, will use the extra time to further recover from off-season shoulder surgery.

""A year is lost but coming off shoulder surgery I really feel like . . . it's going to allow me to get my shoulder to 100 per cent and body feeling great,"" he said. ""I feel disappointed but blessed at the same time I'll be able to get my body and shoulder completely ready to go.""

Bighill, 31, who also won a Grey Cup with B.C. in 2011, will also be busy, working as a financial adviser.

""The idea was to be building a business that eventually I'd transition to (upon retirement),"" said Bighill, twice the CFL's top defensive player. ""It's good for me to be in a position that I am to at least have something I'm building and working on.""

Collaros, 31, who lives just outside Toronto in Aurora, Ont., with his wife and young daughter, has some details to iron out before deciding what's next.

""The trouble with me right now living in Canada is my permanent residency hasn't gone through yet,"" he said. ""So right now I'm only under contract to work for the CFL.

""We're trying to get that all squared away and figure out what to do moving forward.""

Collaros is hopeful fans stick with the CFL.

""I've really grown to love this game, the Canadian game, this league and the fans,"" he said. ""We just ask for the fans to stick behind us and know that we're putting all the work in to come back better and stronger in 2021.""

These are the first pro tournaments on Bear Mountain since the mountain course hosted PGA Tour Champions’ events in 2016 and 2017.","No number three wood? No problem for Yi Cao.

“I still have 13 perfectly good clubs in my bag,” said the pro out of Beach Grove, who lost the club face on his three wood.

Those other clubs were plenty good enough to carry Cao to a share of the first-round lead Monday at 4-under 67 in the Canada Life Series golf tournament on the Bear Mountain Valley course.

“It was nothing special, just a good, solid round,” said the Tsawwassen resident.

“All the top guys played pretty well.”

They included former SFU golf team captain Scott Kerr, who was tied for first with Cao at 67. Andrew Harrison and Michael Blair were tied at 3-under 68 in third place. Amateur Nolan Thoroughgood, the NCAA Pac-12 performer with the Oregon State Beavers who won the Royal Colwood club championship over the weekend, was in a five-way tie for fifth place at 2-under.

The Canada Life series is a consolation for those Canadian pro golfers who missed out on the 2020 Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour season after it was cancelled due to COVID-19. That included the DCBank Victoria Open, which has been a Tour fixture since 1981 and has featured future PGA Tour players from Steve Stricker to Tony Finau.

Cao has played the latter three times at Uplands. He had this year’s PGA Tour China, on which he has full status, also cancelled due to COVID-19.

“It’s tough to be a pro golfer right now,” said the native of Beijing, who came to Canada at 16, and graduated from McNair Secondary in Richmond.

The two Canada Life Series tournaments on the Bear are 54-hole events. The first was on the Mountain course last week. This week’s tournament, from Monday to Wednesday, is on the Valley course. A different approach and game-management outlook is being required in going from mountain to valley.

“The greens are softer and slower on the Valley course than they were on the Mountain course,” said Cao, who turns 30 next month.

“The greens last week were rock solid. These ones are a lot wwmore fair, and a lot more playable, and give you better chances at birdie putts.”

Former UBC Thunderbirds player Evan Holmes of Calgary led wire-to-wire over three rounds to win at 8-under on the mountain course last week, holding off former Washington State Cougars Pac-12 player Zach Anderson of Nanaimo by two strokes. Cao tied for third on the Mountain circuit.

Both Bear Mountain tournaments feature purses of $50,000 and both filled up fast with lengthy waiting lists. Holmes pocketed $9,000 for his win last week and an additional $2,750 bonus for recording the tournament low round. The latter perk is provided for every Canada Life tournament by current and former Canadian PGA Tour players Adam Hadwin, Corey Conners, Nick Taylor, Mackenzie Hughes, Roger Sloan, Michael Gligic, Graham DeLaet, Stephen Ames, David Hearn, Mike Weir and Ian Leggatt to help out the next generation.

The Canada Life Series concludes Sept. 2-4 and Sept. 9-11 at TPC Toronto at Osprey Valley. The series champion over the four tournaments will earn a berth into the 2021 RBC Canadian Open at St. George’s in Toronto.

Cao said he plans to contest all four Canada Life series tournaments to hopefully gain that cherished berth in the 2021 Canadian Open.

Spectators are not allowed for the two Bear Mountain tournaments. There are also no caddies and only a bare number of volunteers allowed on the Bear.

The Canada Life tournaments have been put together by the Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour Canada, which is the launching pad to the Korn Ferry Tour, which in turn is the entry portal to the PGA Tour. The Mackenzie Tour’s alumni includes 41 PGA Tour players and 232 Korn Ferry Tour players produced since 2013.

These are the first pro tournaments on Bear Mountain since the mountain course hosted PGA Tour Champions’ events in 2016 and 2017. The $2.5-million Pacific Links tournaments featured former stars and current seniors such as Colin Montgomerie, John Daly, Bernhard Langer, Vijay Singh, Scott McCarron, Jerry Kelly and Lee Janzen.

Pacific FC head coach Pa-Modou Kah expressed unreserved confidence in goalkeeper Nolan Wirth of Comox heading into today’s Canadian Premier League soccer game against York9 in Charlottetown, P.E.I. (5 p.m. PDT on OneSoccer).

article continues below

Kah has his choice of Wirth, the second-year PFC keeper who played in the NCAA Pac-12 for the Oregon State Beavers, or Canada-capped Callum Irving, dressed in reserve Saturday.

The PFC bench boss said Wirth’s early ball-dribbling error, which led to Wirth fouling former Victoria Highlanders forward Corey Bent of the HFX Wanderers in the box at 12 minutes Saturday, will not be held against him. That led to a penalty-kick goal for the Halifax club, through Brazilian and former Middlesbrough-signed Joao Neto Morelli, which changed the complexion over the first two thirds of the game in the eventual 2-2 tie.

“Mistakes are part of the game,” said Ka h.

“It was a learning moment. Nolan did everything we asked of him. He showed resilience and commitment in coming back after that. We are 100 percent behind Nolan. There is no doubt about that. There was a reason he earned the role [as the season-opener starter].”

Kah, meanwhile, expressed satisfaction about the new rule allowing five subs per game during the abbreviated pandemic season instead of the normal three. All coaches used their subs mostly to the max over the opening weekend.

“The games are thick and fast and there will be some roster rotation for sure [off the bench],” said Kah.

“All our [five] subs did great work and were impactful,” said Kah.

That included Zach Verhoven, who scored the first goal of the season for PFC, to tie the game 1-1 against HFX.

“It shows the depth of our roster, and the fact our quality does not change when we go to our bench,” said Kah.

“We have players who can switch positions, so our versatility [multiplies the bench’s potential].”

Saturday’s opener was Kah’s first as a pro head coach.

“It is different from being an assistant coach to being a head coach,” he said.

“I will never forget my first game in charge [as head coach]. It will be in my mind the rest of my life. I want to grow with these guys as human beings and players.”

York9, from the Greater Toronto Area, opened its pandemic season account also with a 2-2 draw against Atletico Ottawa.

The opening-weekend flow was a bit rusty, as is to be expected following such a delay, but the games were also entertaining and e ventful.

“The last game for PFC was Oct. 19 last season against Valour FC,” noted Kah.

“The boys are getting their legs back. I took a lot of positives out of the first game. I loved our resiliency in coming back to tie and then take the lead [before a late HFX penalty kick tied it 2-2]. There was some sloppiness and a lack of rhythm until the guys settled down and showed their quality. The guys showed they really care for one another. ”

Sophomore Verhoven at 67 minutes and six-times Canada-capped Marco Bustos at 75 minutes scored for PFC in the opener.

“It was a great feeling to play an actual game,” said Bustos, who scored seven goals last season for Valour FC of Winnipeg.

All games are being played on the University of Prince Edward Island’s FIFA-standard Alumni Field turf facility without fans amid the CPL’s “bubble.”

after Charlottetown beat out Langford and Moncton, N.B., to host the CPL season tournament.

Each of the eight teams will play the other once in the round-robin portion of the made-for-TV tournament. Following today’s fixture against York9, PFC meets defending CPL-champion Forge FC of Hamilton in a CBC nationally-televised game Saturday at 1 p.m.. PFC then plays Valour FC on Aug. 25 at 11 a.m., Cavalry FC of Calgary on Aug. 30 at 9 a.m., Atletico Ottawa on Sept. 2 at 5 p.m. and FC Edmonton on Sept. 6 at noon. All times are PDT.

The top-four teams will advance to a playoff-round robin. The top team from that will go directly into the league championship game while the second- and third-place teams will meet in a semifinal with the winner advancing to the championship final.

All games are being broadcast live over the Web on OneSoccer while CBC is broadcasting doubleheaders nationally on Saturdays.

In documents filed by her court-appointed lawyer that give a rare public airing to the wishes of the 38-year-old pop superstar, she asked that her father not return to the role of conservator of her person, which gave him power over her major life decisions from 2008 until 2019, when he temporarily stepped aside, citing health problems.

article continues below

""Britney is strongly opposed to James return as conservator of her person,"" the document says.

James Spears has kept his separate role as conservator over his daughter's finances. For the first 11 years of the conservatorship, he served as co-conservator with attorney Andrew M. Wallet, who resigned from the role early last year.

That briefly left James Spears with sole power over Britney Spears' life, money and career, a situation she says she very much wants to avoid repeating.

An email seeking comment from James Spears' attorney was not immediately returned.

Spears says she wants Jodi Montgomery, who has been serving as conservator of her person temporarily, to do so permanently, but she says that doesn't mean she is waiving her right to seek an end to the entire arrangement.

The documents also reveal that Britney Spears has no plans to perform again anytime soon. She last performed live in October 2018, and early in 2019, cancelled a planned Las Vegas residency.

The filing gave a rare glimpse at Britney Spears' own wishes in the conservatorship that has had vast power over her for over a decade. She has almost never spoken publicly about the matter, and court hearings and documents in the case are cloaked in secrecy, though last year she addressed the court at her request, suggesting she was seeking changes.

In the papers, Britney Spears praises the conservatorship and its work overall, saying it ""rescued her from a collapse, exploitation by predatory individuals and financial ruin"" and that it made her ""able to regain her position as a world class entertainer.""

The document was filed a day before a status hearing on the conservatorship, expected to be closed to the media and public.

Britney Spears' attorney said that he expects James Spears will aggressively contest being marginalized, and said that Britney Spears has suggested they retain a lawyer with expertise in complex financial court fights.

The conservatorship, known in some states as a guardianship, gave James Spears power over his daughter's career choices and much of her personal life, including her relationship with her teenage sons. Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline has custody of the boys, but she has frequent visits with them.

When you are The Killers and your usual guitarist has gone, no problem. When you’re The Killers you can turn to Lindsey Buckingham.

article continues below

The former Fleetwood Mac guitarist steps in for a tune on the new 10-song ""Imploding the Mirage,"" another sign of the band’s clout. The album's guests also include k.d. lang and Adam Granduciel of The War on Drugs.

The absence of guitarist and co-founder Dave Keuning is felt, with keyboards and drums stepping into the void. Without Keuning’s jangle and riff shards, The Killers have a more poppy sound.

If 2017's ""Wonderful Wonderful"" was a meditation on the anxiety of masculinity, the new album often explores the lives of women, with two sharp portraits of tough survivors in ""Blowback"" and ""Caution"" — women whom Brandon Flowers sings each come from ""white trash.""

Many other songs are about loyally backing a partner. ""I’ll be there when water’s rising/I’ll be your lifeguard,"" Flowers sings on ""Dying Breed."" On ""When the Dreams Run Dry,"" he vows: ""I’ll be on your side/When the dreams run dry."" In ""Lightening Fields,"" he sings, ""Just wanted to run my fastest/And stand beside you."" The cover of the album depicts a god tenderly supporting a goddess.

Jonathan Rado of California psychedelic-rock duo Foxygen and Shawn Everett — who worked on ""Wonderful Wonderful"" as well as with Kacey Musgraves and Alabama Shakes — have stepped in to produce and their influence can best be heard on the funky ""Fire in Bone.""

Elsewhere, listeners may have fun finding the band's other influences. There's a Tom Petty-ish sound to ""Blowback"" and ""My Own Soul's Warning"" has a Springsteen vibe. But there's no mistaking that classic Killers mix of soaring vocals, sonic bombast and sly humour in such songs as ""My God"" and the title track. It's a solid album from a band still exploring.

""This is me. I am 'Pipe Nation,'"" she said with a laugh Monday during an interview with The Canadian Press in Sundre, Alta., a picturesque oil town nestled near the Rocky Mountains.

article continues below

""I've been working in the oil and gas industry for about six years. I took a break when the bust happened and did a little serving, a little bartending but always went back to the oil and gas,"" added Gamble, who is 24.

""My father, my grandfather and my great grandfather were all in the oil and gas industry as well.""

Sundre is set to become the fictional community of Hardwell. The drama will focus on day-to-day hardships labourers face, with Gamble's character as the leader of a pipe gang — workers who position and align the pipe, preparing it for the weld. In real life, Gamble has held a number of jobs in the industry including welding.

But this is her first acting part since middle school.

""I always wanted to become an actor because I always thought pretending to be someone and falling into a character is a lot of fun and being someone else,"" she said.

""Unfortunately that's not the direction I went to until now when I got handed this beautiful opportunity that my little-girl dream could come true.""

Filmmaker and director Raoul Bhatt says he wanted a mix of both professional and amateur actors on set, and he's not concerned about the lack of experience from some of his cast members. He sees it as an asset to the project.

""I needed this to be believable and I needed someone with a certain language, a certain grit, combined with people who have actor experience,"" said Bhatt, adding 480 people showed up for the casting call. ""I wanted someone who's believable, honest, sincere and lives in the moment.""

Bhatt, who grew up in Edmonton, has a soft spot for the energy sector and says the show is meant to spotlight the colourful nature of the individuals.

""They're just beautiful people and to showcase that beyond the Dow Jones, beyond just the oil and gas numbers to human struggle, conditions and overcoming adversity and the determination of these characters is what the show is about,"" he said.

Bhatt, a software engineer who self-funded the pilot, has worked as a cinematographer and producer for the Daytime Emmys, as well as with Universal Studios' ""Jurassic World"" and a number of music videos.

He understands there are plenty of people out there who are not fans of the oil and gas industry.

""We are leaning toward pro but again that's for the viewer to decide. If you're against the oil and gas industry that's your opinion but I really hope this creates an emotional connection with the characters.""

Filming of the pilot will be completed by the end of August. Bhatt said he is in negotiations with a couple of streaming services for a 10-episode season.

A storage lot for oilfield equipment in Sundre is one of the regular sets. In addition, a portion of farmland in Sundre has been cleared for the actual building of a mini pipeline to add to the realism of the show.

Bhatt isn't short on technical advisers. Gin Ford, who plays the character Dee, has been a pipeline welder for the past 10-plus years. She has no acting experience but intends to use the show as a vessel for female empowerment and women in the energy industry.

""I'm not here for fame or recognition. I am actually here to make a voice for women in trades. Here's the moment for me to be a voice,"" said Ford.

""I've been called the pipeline princess and it's like, you can roll onto site and right way it's 'this girl's out here to work?'"" she said.

""I definitely want to highlight you can look like you want and you can still work in a male-dominated industry. It doesn't matter if you've got the nails, the lashes, the hair or the Barbie image.""

Ford said the show is meant to be raw, but it's not reality TV or a documentary.

""I'm not going to lie. My mom's probably going to tell me to wash my mouth out with some soap,"" Ford said, noting her character is tough-talking, confident and keeps up with the guys.

Mike Vickers plays Ryan, an East Coaster who moved to Alberta to make his fortune in the oil industry. Art imitates life for Vickers who moved to Alberta from Cape Breton.

""When I read the script it was my life. I fell in love with this. It's going to really showcase that true oil and gas grit, the struggles we all face and how we overcome it together as a family,"" Vickers said.

""There's so much opportunity to better the image of this industry and it's how we all come together is how we're going to do this and tell this story.""

Filming in Sundre is expected to wrap up by Aug. 24 and will finish in Nisku, south of Edmonton, by the end of the month.

Neither Cassirer's heirs nor Spain's Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum dispute the painting's early history.
Both U.S. District Judge John Walter, in a 2019 ruling, and the appeals court in Tuesday's, criticized the baron and the Spanish foundation for not doing more to discover whether the painting was looted art.
Both courts also criticized Spain for not living up to what the courts called ""moral commitments"" to return Nazi-looted art.
But that is the state of the law,"" the appeals court said in its ruling.","LOS ANGELES — A U.S. appeals court has ruled that a Camille Pissarro painting a Jewish woman traded to the Nazis to escape the Holocaust in 1939 may remain the property of a Spanish museum that acquired it more than a half-century later.

The unanimous ruling issued Monday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest — but possibly not the last — in a case that has wound through the courts of Spain and the United States for 20 years.

article continues below

At stake is ""La Rue St. Honoré, effet de Soleil, Après-Midi, 1898,"" an oil-on-canvas work of a rain-swept Paris street that Pissarro painted as he gazed at the scene from his hotel window. Its value has been estimated at $30 million.

Lilly Cassirer’s father-in-law bought it directly from Pissarro’s art dealer and left it to her and her husband when he died. In 1939, she traded it to the Nazis in exchange for exit visas for herself, her husband and her grandson, who eventually settled in the U.S. Her great-grandson, David Cassirer of San Diego, has continued the litigation since his father's death.

Neither Cassirer's heirs nor Spain's Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum dispute the painting's early history.

What's at issue all these years later is whether Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza made any serious effort to determine the painting was looted art when he acquired it from a New York gallery owner for $275,000 in 1976.

Also whether Spanish curators did their due diligence in tracing its provenance when a Spanish non-profit foundation acquired it and hundreds of other paintings from the baron's collection in 1992 and created the Madrid museum that bears his name.

Lilly Cassirer’s heirs say she spent years trying to recover the painting before concluding it was lost and accepting $13,000 in reparations from the German government in 1958.

It wasn’t until 1999 that her grandson, Claude, who had vividly recalled seeing it hanging in the family's German home, discovered it in the Madrid museum. After Spain refused to hand it over, he sued.

Attorney Thaddeus Stauber, who has represented the museum since the case reached U.S. courts in 2005, hailed Monday's decision, noting that the painting was sold and resold to numerous legitimate and prominent collectors over the years before the baron obtained it, with none discovering it had been seized by the Nazis.

He said there also appeared to be no effort by Thyssen-Bornemisza or any other collector to hide it from the public.

""We've been transparent from the start of this case, and we're very pleased that there's been a trial now and it brings it to a conclusion, we trust,"" he said Tuesday.

He did say the Cassirer family may appeal to the full 9th Circuit or even the U.S. Supreme Court.

The family did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday, but the president of the Holocaust Survivors Foundation USA denounced the decision.

""The Nazis murdered more than 6 million Jews, including 1.5 million children under the age of 12, and including 105 members of my family,"" David Schaecter said. ""How on God’s Earth can Spain fight so hard to deny a Jewish family its precious legacy that was looted by the Nazis? And how on God’s Earth can an American court ignore the unprecedented trauma of the Holocaust and reward Spain for its greed?""

Both U.S. District Judge John Walter, in a 2019 ruling, and the appeals court in Tuesday's, criticized the baron and the Spanish foundation for not doing more to discover whether the painting was looted art. But both courts concluded there was no proof either deliberately hid that it was.

Both courts also criticized Spain for not living up to what the courts called ""moral commitments"" to return Nazi-looted art.

""It is perhaps unfortunate that a country and a government can preen as moralistic in its declarations, yet not be bound by those declarations. But that is the state of the law,"" the appeals court said in its ruling."

Even so, back-to-school shopping doesn't have to be more expensive than any other year, said Seung Hwan (Mark) Lee, an associate professor of retail management at Ryerson University.
If your child is doing virtual classes, he suggests ensuring you have a reliable laptop or tablet with a webcam.
If you're feeling anxious or stressed about back to school shopping and advertisements are making you feel you better get to a store soon, Lee says not worry.
""Find out more about what your school district is doing, and then adjust according to that.","TORONTO — Vonny Sweetland has yet to decide if he will be sending his 12-year-old sister Josephine back to class in September, but just in case he does, he's been stocking up on supplies for months.

He picks up hand sanitizer when he sees it in stores, grabbed new masks last month, bought a fresh uniform and has been testing out Josephine's muscle power with some new lunch containers.

The new additions to her backpack and are all part of a wave of changes families — and their wallets — are being confronted with as they prepare for back to school, whether it's sourcing protective equipment or choosing a thermos their child can open unassisted.

""In a COVID-era, all of these things we take for granted or think are minuscule are actually really important,"" said Sweetland, who is his sister's guardian.

""These are things as simple as a teacher helping you unpack your lunch or zipping a zipper. To prevent potential spread, I don't think teachers are really going to be doing these things.""

The cost of so many new supplies can easily add up.

A Deloitte survey of 1,200 parents who have at least one child attending school in grades K-12 this fall found the average family will spend $102 on school supplies, $216 on clothing and accessories, $395 on computers and hardware, $316 on electronic gadgets and digital subscriptions.

The survey, which was conducted between May and July, found those families will allocate $61 on a new category: home or health supplies.

Even so, back-to-school shopping doesn't have to be more expensive than any other year, said Seung Hwan (Mark) Lee, an associate professor of retail management at Ryerson University.

He recommends shoppers compare prices and take advantage of sales.

Anne Marie Taber said she's noticed plenty of sales, though she hasn't sought them out when shopping with seven-year-old daughter Avery because she tries to minimize her time in stores and instead use online options with delivery to lessen her exposure to the virus.

She stocked up as soon as she could on Old Navy's uniform-style clothing because several sizes were out of stock and also grabbed Avery a new backpack.

On top of masks and hand sanitizers, they bought a wide-mouth water bottle without a straw to make cleaning easy, plastic Duo-Tangs that can be wiped down and a set of art supplies that Avery has been reminded not to share.

""This is extra stuff we haven't had to buy in the past but it's a small dollar to pay to make sure that that is just hers exclusively,"" Taber said.

Parents may also want to consider disposable cutlery, if they have children that bring lunches to school and are worried about germs spreading through anything reuseable, Lee said.

If your child is doing virtual classes, he suggests ensuring you have a reliable laptop or tablet with a webcam.

Those who want to go all out or are older and have specific needs for programs they are enrolled in, may need to think about microphones and speakers too.

Those supplies don't come cheap. However, the cost of those high-ticket items could be partially offset by a change he sees happening across universities and colleges during the pandemic.

""It's no longer really about carrying around the heavy textbooks,"" he said.

""Many professors aren't holding lengthy exams because the exams are becoming very difficult to monitor and you can't really get a proctor to look at how students are conducting their exams... so using test banks or textbooks no longer apply.""

If you're feeling anxious or stressed about back to school shopping and advertisements are making you feel you better get to a store soon, Lee says not worry.

""I would advise parents right now not to rush into getting supplies,"" he said.

""Find out more about what your school district is doing, and then adjust according to that. A deal can always be had.""

Each summer, the former U.S. president unveils a selection of his favourite songs of the season.

Most of the artists are household names, but Obama often leaves room to showcase a few lesser-known acts, much to their surprise.

Shauf says he learned about his placement when a listener tagged him on Instagram shortly after Obama revealed the playlist on social media.

""It's cool to think that Obama, or the Obamas together, have listened to my music,"" he said.

""It's a really nice feeling to think my music has gone that far.""

""Neon Skyline"" is a particularly Canadian song choice because its story unravels inside the Skyline Restaurant, a real-life diner in Toronto's Parkdale neighbourhood, where two friends agree to meet for a beer shortly before one runs into his ex.

Shauf, who was born in Regina, said he frequented the Skyline when he moved to Toronto several years back

""It became a really friendly place to hang out and the setting for my record,"" he said.

Shauf has been a critical favourite in Canada for years. He was nominated for multiple Juno Awards, and ""The Neon Skyline"" landed on the long list of Polaris Prize contenders for this year's best album.

Fellow Canadian artists Drake and PartyNextDoor also showed up on Obama's list.

Both of them shared billing on Popcaan's track ""Twist & Turn,"" while Drake was also featured for his part on Rihanna's megahit ""Work.""

PartyNextDoor, who is Mississauga, Ont.-raised rapper Jahron Brathwaite, made a second appearance for his solo effort ""PGT,"" taken from his 2020 album, ""Partymobile.""

Solange Bernard, head of marketing communications, said Tim Hortons started working with Mattel last year to roll out a hockey-themed Barbie as part of a charitable initiative aimed at getting girls involved in the sport.

Bernard said the plan was originally to launch one doll, but amid protests against anti-Black racism in recent months, Tim Hortons decided to push back the launch to make the product more diverse.

Tim Hortons worked with Mattel to rush the production of a Black version of the Barbie doll, Bernard said.

I never thought I’d look at that text again, but with all the talk about COVID-19 learning loss I was curious.

article continues below

Was anything lost over a lifetime gone forever?

Of course, 60 years later ,the Latin text is online now so I had to take a look.

“Sic fatur lacrimans, classique immittit habenas, et tandem Euboicis Cumarum adlabitur oris.”

Sixty years later, with not a word of Latin during that time, it was, more or less, somehow familiar. I took a stab at it and, with some help from online Google translate, I still had a good sense of Virgil’s narrative, if not anywhere near an exact translation.

“Thus he spoke, tears in his eyes, gives reins for the fleet

and finally Euboian shores”

No doubt scholars of the classics will be all over me, but you get the general idea.

No, the story came back like a wonderful movie I’d never really forgotten; the Trojan fleet arrives on the shores of Italy, Aeneas makes for the Temple of Apollo, where the Sibyl, a priestess, meets him — a wonderful story and an ancient language which had survived in the dark corners of my ageing hippocampus — vague and short on detail, but still in there somewhere.

Thanks to the exponential advances in information technology over the past 60 years, I could find what my age and curiosity thought I had lost forever, but now could find again.

Some years ago, I was supervising and enthusiastic young teacher trainee as she taught algebra — a subject I remember disliking intensely in Grade 12.

She was explaining simultaneous equations and how (a+b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2 and why.

Probably because I knew I would not be facing a test, I found it fascinating — “how did I miss out on this stuff — I sort of remember it now.”

So I looked up “simultaneous equations.” Again, there it all was, in an instant.

The point of all this nostalgia is that what we learned once we probably never forget altogether and, despite time away from the classroom, and with access to the technology to retrieve it, should we so choose, it is still at the tips of our fingers on a computer keyboard.

That being so, I have to wonder if all the dire predictions about kids “losing their education” because of COVID school shutdowns is missing the point. Information learnt in a classroom is not lost because of a pause in school attendance.

In fact, every September teachers retrieve, revisit and refresh previous learning in the first week or so back at school before moving on to the new stuff.

In the age of home-based curricular centred learning technology the particulars of even an obscure Latin text — even algebra can be retrieved and relearned easily enough — if needed for some reason.

What might be lost unless we come up with alternatives such as a safe and workable “Plan B” for getting kids back into schools at least part time is more profound and possibly more damaging to our society than that.

What might be lost is the experience of socio-cultural equity that schools create.

As our schools are moving online during the COVID shutdown, some suburban groups of parent are already considering employing tutors and creating mini-schools at home.

Other parents will buy upgraded home computers or send their kids to independent schools if they have the financial wherewithal to do that .

But if cultural equity through educational opportunity is something we had challenges with before COVID, a reprise of shutdowns of public schools as a “Plan B” will further magnify existing social inequities and cultural class divisions.

So what do we do? One alternative might be shortening the hours of instruction and running the schools on morning and afternoon shifts, which would reduce the school building’s population on any given day and reduce virus risks.

That way kids still experience public school with other kids not from families like their own. That’s how kids learn about living in a diverse community, learn about living in a diverse Canada. That’s something we really don’t want to lose.

And kids who have special individual learning needs? Most learning specialists suggests that when schools do reopen, it is those kids who should be prioritized for as much time as possible in classrooms with specially trained teachers.

Let’s get this “class composition” thing right for those kids this time around.

Finally, let’s face the fact that starting classrooms safely, with reduced class sizes, reduced hours of instruction, specialist teachers, upgraded air-circulation systems, insistence on wearing masks, sanitizing hands and maintaining social distancing if it is all done properly, will be more difficult and more expensive than anybody thought.

But as as Joni Mitchell so succinctly put it: “You don’t know what you’ve lost ’til it’s gone.”

So let’s not save dollars in the short term by allowing COVID to cost public education more than anybody can afford in the long term.

I find it troubling that a word that can be so offensive has found a place in the mouths of youths. They call themselves “savage” if they’ve done something without caring about repercussions or how it affects others around them. When they use this word, it’s viewed as a compliment.

article continues below

I don’t know if they are aware this was, and still is, a derogatory term used toward Indigenous people. It’s a word that was used to infer Indigenous people weren’t human. If young people knew this, I wonder if it would change their minds about using it.

There are many terms and names that become mainstream that are offensive to communities they reference.

When I heard the Edmonton Eskimos football club was changing its name, it made me sigh and think to myself: “It’s about time.”

There are many sports teams across North America that have their names and mascots derived from Indigenous communities or Indigenous stereotypes. These names have been under scrutiny for many years and not just by Indigenous people.

I welcome the name change of the Edmonton football team and I think it is a great step forward.

When organizations are making decisions such as this one, I don’t think there needs to be consensus. Not everyone has to be offended for a name to be changed and not everyone has to agree. If the name refers to an Indigenous community and the community, or many in the community are offended by it, that’s whose opinion should matter most.

I know many sport fans may have an issue with it and they have many nostalgic memories of the team name and the logo. There is bound to be the argument, “That’s what it’s always been, what’s the problem?”

I hear these reactions and I understand, I really do. Change is hard for all of us. The team was founded in 1895 and officially adopted the name the Edmonton Eskimos in 1910. I am not sure what connotation the word “Eskimo” had in 1910, or what the Inuit community thought of the word being used in the team’s name at that time. I do know that words’ meanings and appropriateness change over time.

I am 38 years old and when I was a child, other children would ask me: “Are you an Indian?” The word “Indian” was used back then, and hopefully, no one today would ever ask me that same question with that phrasing today.

Politically correct terms have changed over the years. When I was in middle school, my peers asked me if I was “Native.” By my late teens. I was asked if I was “First Nations.” Then the questions changed to “Aboriginal” and now the word is “Indigenous.”

As correct terms evolve, we can do our best to evolve with them and listen to others who can correct us when a term or phrase being used can be deemed offensive. We can’t all stay up-to-date on everything all the time, and that’s when we can rely on teaching moments as they happen.

With the Edmonton team the name has been under scrutiny for a while, it’s not something that just happened overnight.

I am of First Nations and Inuit descent, and my family is from Fort Chipewyan in northern Alberta. I was adopted at birth and not raised in an Indigenous home. I am very proud to have Inuit roots even if I don’t know very much about my culture.

I have seen online the support of Inuit leaders and Elders toward the decision to change the name of the Edmonton team.

In the United States, the Washington Redskins football club has announced its name change as well. It has had the same name since 1937. For the 2020 season it will be called Washington Football Team.

I am impressed that these institutions have committed to doing better and in this process they are publicly demonstrating the importance of respecting Indigenous people. It’s steps like this that start conversations and demonstrate why using the term “savage” isn’t OK."

Effort of 2 men in dog rescue is inspiring

“Dog rescued from cave, reunited with owners three months after becoming lost,” Aug. 12.

I want to thank the Times Colonist for bringing us the story about the rescue of Stella the dog by Zach Regan and Matt Johnson. In these anxiety inducing times their story is just the tonic we need. It gave us the chance to marvel at the determination and perseverance of two young men who put a lot of effort into doing the right thing.

Not only did they go to great inconvenience and some risk to bring the dog off the beach, but they also followed up by making the extra effort to contact the non-profit ROAM group that reunites owners with their missing pets. And then to find out that the owners had lost the dog on their honeymoon hike, leaving a dark cloud on what should be a happy time, made the rescue and reunion all the more poignant.

Zach said it was the best outcome he could have hoped for and it was the best outcome for all the TC readers too. You gave us the gift of an uplifting story of hope just when we needed it most!

Out on trail, keep dogs on leash

Fortunately this saga had a happy ending. Zach Regan and Matt Johnson are true heroes for rescuing Stella from where she was trapped on the Juan de Fuca Trail.

Dogs are meant to be on-leash on the Juan de Fuca Provincial Park trail for good reasons — protection of wildlife, maintaining the integrity of the trail environment, as well as for the protection of the dogs and others. This is a rugged hike with many potentially treacherous areas and drop-offs if one ventures off the designated trail.

Even a well trained dog will “take off” to chase an animal or if frightened by something in the wilderness, especially an unfamiliar dense wilderness. Many people think their dog will stick with them, but dogs will be dogs. Those of us who live in the rural areas see many poorly controlled dogs off-leash in our parks and on our trails, which is increasing with everyone heading out of town to the country during the pandemic.

As a dog owner, I can imagine the anguish the owners would have suffered after losing Stella. But my sympathies are more with Stella, and I shudder to think what she endured over the three months she was missing. It is up to us to make sure our pets are managed safely.

Restaurant servers should wear masks

Over the last few weeks my wife and I, both seniors have ventured out to some of our favourite places for lunch. Of the four that we visited we would only consider returning to one. All had very good signage, tables well spaced apart and sanitized before use and also separate entrance and exit.

However, apart from one, the serving staff did not wear masks and stood above us, right next to the table, to take our orders. We are encouraged to wear masks when social distancing is not possible so why not in restaurants? It is important to help our local businesses during these turbulent times but they must make customers feel safe in order to gain our continued support.

Positive attitude will help keep us healthy

Re: “Please focus on the positive,” letter, Aug. 14.

The letter writer invites us to focus on the positive. A good reminder especially during these COVID times.

It brings to mind how much we hear about the “number of cases” in B.C. and the rest of the world. Five months of this makes me feel like I’m being brain-washed.

Have we forgotten the miracles of our bodies? We cut ourselves and the body immediately begins to heal. That is the nature of our bodies – to heal – always wanting to bring itself back into balance and health. But many may feel their bodies have betrayed them.

But where have we betrayed our bodies and not given them what they need in order to be at optimal health? A positive attitude is always important, so perhaps shifting our focus away from the daily COVID numbers and putting our attention on something more constructive, like keeping our bodies healthier, might be a positive use of our time.

They were here illegally

Re: “Dozens gather for 10th ­anniversary of MV Sun Sea arrival,” Aug. 14.

Why is it that the media always seems to make the Conservatives under Stephen Harper sound like “bad guys,” which was exactly what the comment “were labelled by the then-Conservative government as ‘terrorists and illegals,’ ” sounded like.

The people who arrived on the MV Sun Sea were here illegally.

“We were detained, interrogated, stripped of our names and identities,” she said. Yes, they were , that’s what all countries do when someone enters their country illegally. Yes, they were migrants fleeing a war zone and people appreciate that, but they came here illegally and should expect to be thoroughly checked.

Federal Public Safety Minister Vic Toews called some of the passengers “suspected human smugglers and terrorists” and warned about criminal organizations abusing Canada’s refugee system.” That’s what he was supposed to do. Yes, we have to be compassionate for these people, but we also have to follow the rules to make sure Canada is safe.

A lack of cheering for Toronto teams

A friend recently asked why I was not a fan of the Jays/Leafs/Raptors, all Toronto teams that do reasonably well, especially the Raptors who won it all last year. My answer was quite simply that I did not appreciate the fact that all sports reporting in Canada seems to come out of Toronto (with the exception of the Canucks — their coverage in this area is excellent) and as a result we get bombarded by Toronto’s point of view and often with a bias.

Imagine if you will that the head coach of one of Toronto’s teams was rushed to the hospital in the middle of an important playoff series. You can be sure this would be covered by every outlet of the Toronto media, this being a Toronto story.

Last night, the head coach of the Montreal Canadiens was rushed to hospital, in the night following the Habs game with the Philadelphia Flyers. Tonight, on the National, not a single mention was made of this.

However, this story was not about Toronto.

Generic replies from the government

I have been writing to the minister of municipal affairs and housing. The response I receive smacks of a form letter. It doesn’t really address my concerns about providing so many benefits to people who move here who are homeless or addicted to drugs that come here from other provinces.

One of the best climates in the world, where they can camp in beautiful surroundings, while they are provided with all their necessities. Why not move to Victoria?

Clearly, Victoria is attracting large numbers of homeless and drug-addicted because of the support system here. And yet we don’t see decreasing numbers, we see increasing numbers. It seems apparent that the plans in place are not working effectively. The provincial and city governments need to consider another approach.

How their words are heeded

It has little to do with nice Bonnie Henry or stern Minister Dix, but more to do with how their words are heeded.

It is almost heresy to say the least negative remark about our provincial health officer — she has been de facto premier for the past few months .

And she is most often on target with her remarks if sometimes a little condescending. The slavish adherence to heath information that is almost changing daily is also a risky business.

The latest COVID-19 numbers for B.C., third largest daily increase this week since the virus arrived, shows only too clearly that it is the public that must take hold of the advice and practice common sense behaviour.

Canada as a whole and B.C. as well need more testing as well as more contact tracing , evidenced by the fact that the province has just now increased the number of people that will be doing contact tracing .

It might be useful to remind ourselves that virus incidence in B.C. is not the lowest of any province, and that as a country our testing rate is lower that the U.S. testing rate. According to worldometers.info, the U.S. is testing at a rate of 204,000 per million population and Canada at 121,000.

Of course, that is not to say that B.C. has not done well up to now but it is to indicate that we may have been a little complacent given our performance vis a vis the bigger provinces, ignoring perhaps the urban concentration of say Greater Toronto which has 5.9 million people, which is larger than B.C.’s total population of 4.6 million and more than double Metro Vancouver.

Keep Ocean Blvd. closed to cars

I would like to say how very much I and others are enjoying the Ocean Boulevard and Esquimalt Lagoon now that barriers block it from being used as a thoroughfare. Other walkers agree with me that with no cars to avoid, just being there is a peaceful and lovely experience.

I understand that a referendum about keeping it that way was voted on and the cars won out with the result that in September the barriers will be removed and drivers will once again push us park users, walkers, joggers and cyclists to the edges of the road.

Much as I hate using the word in ANY context, commuters should NOT trump families; parks are for people not cars — particularly as this one is also a bird sanctuary. It isn’t as though commuters have no other route to take and no other choice to make.

Everyone I’ve spoken to is just loving the way things have been since the barriers went up and I would like to call for a second referendum to be presented, this one with a lot more publicity than last time, and I think you would find the end result to be in favour of peace and quiet, not for pollution, noise, speeding and verbal abuse.

Please reconsider.

What the premier actually said

Re: “Vandalism needs to be condemned,” letter, Aug. 13

I’m sad to see another letter from an Albertan who has told been told “fake news” in regards to our premier’s statement about out-of-province plates. It includes wrong information about what John Horgan said, as well as other inflammatory statements.

Our premier welcomes our fellow Canadians from Alberta.

I listened to what he said and he berated any British Colombians acting with hate towards visitors and is very sympathetic towards anyone being subjected to harassment. After many statements like this, he mentioned that as an alternative to avoid being vandalized and harassed, visitors could use public transit and newly arrived residents need to update their vehicle registration. I feel the letter writer already had a bias against the premier and used this misinformation against him and I would like to correct that.

It’s more than just the mayor deciding

It is always with great amusement that I read letters to the editor, or articles, berating various elected officials. Lately, the flurry has been over the Richardson bike lanes.

Lisa Helps, as mayor of Victoria, has been on the receiving end of much of the criticism.

I don’t live in Victoria, I don’t vote for their city council, but I would remind the various objectors: Mayor Helps is not a one-person council. Victoria city has nine elected councillors (eight plus a mayor).

Any motion before council, the nasty bike lanes included, need a majority. For all the bike lane development in this city it has been just that: a majority of council voted in favour.

On the most recent bike lane additions, namely Richardson, only two councillors voted against it (Young and Thornton-Joe). That means the mayor alone was not responsible, but seven of the elected council thought it was a great idea. And it doesn’t stop there.

Mayor Helps was not alone in pursuing the rapid bike lane growth in the city. Believe it or not, there is a staff at city that consults and advises. In fact, in the fall of 2019 there was a call for input on the Richardson bike lanes by that very staff.

I’m not a defender of Mayor Helps, just a mere observer. But with just a few moments of your time, a Google search lets you uncover the fascinating world of municipal politics and the voting patterns of all the current council members on the bike lane additions.

I think you may well be surprised to see just who has been variously opposed or in favour. So remember, this is how democracy works — on every level of our government. It’s not a one person show.

Re: “Amid pandemic, hate is the dominant emotion being expressed,” comment, Aug. 13.

Whilst not saying Victoria, you are in the local paper! How about fear, stress, anxiety and being depressed. You are forgetting during this pandemic we worked together, volunteered, and donated.

If fear and anxiety are projected as anger, you have translated to hate to stop the democratic right to express how we are feeling. Many have lost income, family members and dealing with huge demands on their emotional wellbeing. Long months of lockdown and giving up all our old norms.

Only now to see abuse of our green space, and not even feeling safe in our homes. Even with our personal safety, we cannot take it for granted any more..

In search of peace and quiet

I am wondering where I can go to find peace and quiet because the parks and beaches are inundated with irresponsible pet owners and their unleashed dogs. It’s not that I dislike dogs but I don’t know their dogs and when they come running up to me, sometimes jumping up on me, I do get afraid.

In these times of COVID-19, I need to de-stress in nature and it seems so unfair that I can’t do that without feeling uncomfortable and sometimes afraid.

The dogs also chase and frighten shore birds, which is upsetting to watch.

Then there is also the issue of many plastic dog poop bags that I come across either sticking out of the sand, thrown in the bushes or, worse, into the ocean and lakes.

A number of years ago a friend of mine rotated his tires and forgot to snug up the nuts on one wheel. Due to the noise coming from the loose wheel he quickly pulled over and discovered the issue.

Whenever you hear odd noises coming from your car, don’t ignore them. Wheel nuts can come loose for a number of reasons, or it could be a wheel bearing failing, both of which could result in you losing a wheel.

So when you hear weird noises, stop and figure out why or call a professional. Ignoring such noises never ends well.

Of note is the fact that even the local reptiles are aware it is the safest commuter route in the area just as it is.

Please focus on the positive

Re: “Amid pandemic, hate is the dominant emotion being expressed,” Aug. 13.

Kudos to Grant McKenzie for speaking up. I agree that we are seeing more anger and intolerance from the general public right now.

People feel helpless in the new COVID-19 world.

Maybe we should focus on positive changes as McKenzie suggests rather than joining the rally cry against people in tents and parks.

People are forgetting pandemic rules

I am disgusted that people in B.C. seem to have forgotten all the things we did at the start of this pandemic.

We had low numbers under Bonnie Henry’s leadership.

Get back to the way we were behaving, people, as we are going in the wrong direction.

To the young people who feel their lives have been too constricted, your partying is costing lives and people’s suffering. Let’s hope that some of the growing numbers aren’t your friends and family.

How would you feel if a parent or grandparent died because you needed some face time with your friends. Think selfish.

Community events should be banned

So, as was the case after Canada Day, the COVID-19 incubation period following the August long weekend, seems to have now resulted in a spike in new cases “from community events.”

Will the premier and health officials do the logical thing and ban community events for Labour Day — distasteful as that is — or are they comfortable with “it is what it is”?

Re: “Tent cities versus human rights,” letter, Aug. 11.

The writer is misinformed with his assertion that Glendale was a facility for people with addictions or mental illness. On the contrary!

Like Woodlands in New Westminster, and Tranquille near Kamloops, it housed men, women, and children with intellectual disabilities.

People with intellectual disabilities may, like the general population, have mental health issues; however, they are more often living with Down’s Syndrome, cerebral palsy or other significant brain injuries.

When these institutions were closed their residents were successfully accommodated in their local communities with their families or in community living facilities with appropriate living and life supports.

Let’s not confuse those living successfully with intellectual disabilities with those who are struggling with homelessness and profound mental health issues.

The latter need the same level of support in a different and I think more challenging societal context!

Time to clean Government Street

Government Street is looking so sad. The restaurant street patios look tawdry. And when was the last time a street cleaner hosed things down? Do the patios prevent that?

Seagull poop mixed with dead leaves and trash. Overheard at one of those restaurant patios, “It’s so dirty here!”

Spot on!

Another cut of a thousand in the death of the city’s charm.

Back to school with tents across the street

I live in James Bay and have experienced the effects of the tent encampment in Beacon Hill Park.

I agree the homeless problem is the result of gaps in our social safety net.

Classes will resume in September at South Park school under the cloud of the pandemic. The situation across Douglas Street from the school is another reason the encampment must be moved.

Children, in some cases starting school for the first time, are the most vulnerable members of our society. The stress, risk and danger to children attending South Park needs to be mitigated.

If even one child is injured or scared by the encampment residents, we have all failed.

Vandalism needs to be condemned

The B.C. border has not been closed by public health authorities. All Canadians including Albertans have the right to travel in B.C. while abiding by local public health protocols without being subject to vandalism and harassment.

B.C. residents who vandalize vehicles of Albertans in B.C. are committing crimes.

Premier John Horgan’s failure to condemn such crimes and harassment by some B.C. residents and his absurd admonishment to Albertans to change their licence plates or use public transit is appalling and irresponsible.

It is a Trump-style dog whistle condoning acts of vandalism and harassment by B.C. residents against Albertans.

Horgan fails to heed the advice of health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, to “be kind, be calm, be safe.”

Horgan and many B.C. residents suffer from the delusion that B.C. is for the exclusive benefit of B.C. residents.

Horgan’s statements reflect a parochial politician risen to the level of his own incompetence and they reflect what is wrong with Canada.

There has been a long standing and ongoing failure of leadership by the prime minister and provincial premiers in finding any national purpose or interest beyond the backyards of provinces.

So long as premiers like Horgan are in office, Canada is no more than a confederation of provincial backyards.

Michelaine Lahaie, chair of the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for RCMP, says a video shows an RCMP officer opening the door of a moving police vehicle, which hits the man.

article continues below

The officer and other Mounties then use force to arrest him while he's on the ground.

Lahaie says the man was then injured in an alleged assault by another detained man in a cell at the Kinngait RCMP detachment and had to be flown to Iqaluit for medical treatment.

She says the investigation is to determine whether the conduct of the Mounties, including use of force, was reasonable.

She says in a news release that the probe will be a Public Interest Investigation into the conduct of RCMP in Kinngait.

""The RCMP members' conduct will be assessed in accordance with relevant law and RCMP policy,"" reads the terms of reference of the investigation released Tuesday.

""Consideration will also be given as to whether racial bias and/or discrimination played a role in the man's arrest and subsequent treatment.""

Lahaie noted the review she has requested by the commission is separate from an investigation by the Ottawa Police Service at the request of the Mounties and an RCMP internal Code of Conduct review.

""I am concerned with the conduct of RCMP members involved in this serious incident and will monitor both the OPS (Ottawa police) investigation and the RCMP's Code of Conduct investigation,"" Lahaie said in a release.

""The CRCC's investigation will provide an added level of scrutiny to the incident, as it will additionally examine the circumstances that led to the man being placed in a cell at the RCMP detachment where another detainee assaulted him and he needed to be airlifted to Iqaluit for treatment.

""I am aware that there is historical distrust by Inuit toward the police and I am committed to increasing RCMP accountability.""

The day after the man's arrest Nunavut Justice Minister Jeannie Ehaloak said she was outraged.

""I have seen the video from Kinngait circulating on social media and am very concerned by the unnecessary force, the violence and the lack of respect I have seen,'' she said in a release at the time.

""Nunavummiut should not fear this kind of treatment and disregard for safety and basic rights.''

Ehaloak said she would formally request a review by the commission.

The Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the Mounties was created to ensure that public complaints made about the conduct of RCMP members are examined fairly and impartially.

Here is what that means and what could come next.

Word — The term comes through Middle English and Old French from a Latin root, prorogare, to prolong.

article continues below

Effect — Prorogation essentially ends a session of Parliament, allowing for a new beginning with a speech from the throne.

Legislation — At one time, prorogation killed all legislation before Parliament, but rule changes now provide that most bills can be revived in the new session at the same stage they were at when the previous session ended.

Committees — Committees, including special and legislative committees, cease to exist. Membership on committees, except the membership of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, is terminated and all chairs and vice-chairs no longer hold these positions.

Documents — No document may be tabled until the first day of a new session.

Quote — ""Prorogation of a session brings to an end all proceedings before Parliament. With certain exceptions, unfinished business 'dies' on the Order Paper and must be started anew in a subsequent session."" — House of Commons Procedure and Practice, Third Edition, 2017.

Length — Prorogation can be as short as a few hours, or as long as several months. During this period, the House of Commons and Senate are shut down but the government remains in power and MPs remain MPs.

Frequency — Most Parliaments are prorogued at least once and often there are several prorogations and sessions in the life of a Parliament.

Authority — Prorogation is ordered by the Governor General on the advice of the prime minister. It is not covered by statute. Rather it is a personal legal power of the Governor General and by convention the prime minister has the right to provide advice. And by convention it's actually the prime minister's decision.

Granted — Prorogation is routinely granted. In December 2008, then-governor general Michaelle Jean took a few hours before granting prorogation, but that was a thorny case because opposition parties were threatening to defeat the government and install a coalition government shortly after an election.

Ceremony — At one time, prorogation was done in a formal ceremony in the Senate chamber, but that hasn't been used in decades. A simple proclamation signed by the Governor General does the trick today.

Liberal promise — In their 2015 election platform, the Liberals said Stephen Harper's Conservatives ""used prorogation to avoid difficult political circumstances. We will not.""

Limits — Governments can't use prorogation to shut down Parliament indefinitely. That would violate the constitutional requirement that Parliament meet at least once every 12 months. And without Parliament to approve a budget and spending estimates, the government would run out of money.

John McCain of Arizona.

She’s just the latest Republican to join in the convention, after a number of notable GOP former elected officials — including former Ohio Gov. John Kasich — endorsed the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee on Monday night. It's a continuation of a major theme that Democrats have pushed through the first night of the convention — an effort to broaden the party's appeal to occasional Republicans and disaffected Trump voters.

article continues below

In an advance clip from the video shared with The Associated Press, Cindy McCain talks about how Biden, then a Delaware senator, met her husband when John McCain was assigned to be a military aide for him on a trip overseas. The two became friends, and the families would gather for picnics in the Bidens’ backyard.

""They would just sit and joke. It was like a comedy show, sometimes, to watch the two of them,"" she says in the clip.

Cindy McCain is not expected to offer an explicit endorsement, but her involvement in the video is her biggest public show of support yet for Biden’s candidacy. McCain was the 2008 Republican presidential nominee against Democrat Barack Obama, who won the election with Biden as his vice-presidential running mate.

Both Cindy McCain and her daughter Meghan have been outspoken critics of President Donald Trump, and the family is longtime friends with the Bidens. Trump targeted John McCain personally in 2015, saying the former prisoner of war wasn't a hero ""because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured."" McCain later angered Trump with his dramatic thumbs-down vote against repealing President Barack Obama’s health care law.

When McCain died on a Saturday in 2018, the Trump administration lowered the American flag over the White House to half-staff but then raised it by Monday. After public outcry, the White House flags were again lowered. Trump wasn't invite to McCain's funeral.

Biden consoled Meghan McCain on an appearance on ""The View"" after her father was diagnosed with the cancer that eventually took his life. She has said Biden often reaches out to her to offer support, after losing his own son Beau to the same cancer in 2015.

But while Meghan suggested in April she’d be voting for Biden, Cindy has pointedly stayed out of the presidential race. In April of last year, amid rumours that the McCains would wade into the election in support of Biden, Cindy McCain tweeted that Biden is ""a wonderful man and a dear friend of the McCain family.""

""However,"" she added at the time, ""I have no intention of getting involved in presidential politics.""

The video on Biden's friendship with McCain is one of a series of short documentaries created by Oscar Award-winning director Davis Guggenheim, who worked on ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" the 2006 documentary on climate change that featured former Vice-President Al Gore. On Monday night, Guggenheim’s short film focused on Biden’s relationship with the Amtrak conductor and workers on the trains he took from Delaware to Washington as senator aired during the convention."

University president the Rev. John Jenkins said there have been 147 confirmed cases of coronavirus on campus since the start of classes for the university’s approximately 12,000 students.

Jenkins said he decided against sending students home after consulting with the St. Joseph County Health Department. Instead, university officials decided steps could be taken short of closing the campus while still protecting students' health and safety.

The university is advising off-campus students not to visit the campus and on-campus students not to venture off-campus and is restricting student gatherings to 10 people or less. The university is allowing graduate student access to research laboratories and libraries. Athletic teams subject to surveillance testing can continue to gather for sanctioned activities, but will be closely monitored.

""The virus is a formidable foe,"" Jenkins said in announcing enhanced testing for students experiencing symptoms and surveillance testing for those without symptoms. ""For the past week, it has been winning. Let us as the Fighting Irish join together to contain it.""

According to Jenkins, the university has traced the spike in COVID-19 cases to off-campus gatherings where neither masks were worn nor physical distancing observed. He said students infected at those gatherings passed it on to others, who in turn passed the virus on to others, resulting in the positive cases, with all but one a student.

Jenkins asked students to help in identifying others who have been flagrantly violating safety protocols.

The action by Notre Dame follows the decision by officials of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to switch to remote learning starting Wednesday, and is making arrangements for students who want to leave campus housing. UNC officials said clusters of COVID-19 were discovered in dorms, a fraternity house and other student housing.

Coronavirus outbreaks earlier this summer at fraternities in Washington state, California and Mississippi provided a glimpse of the challenges school officials face in keeping the virus from spreading on campuses where young people gather in close quarters.

The virus has been blamed for over 170,000 deaths and 5.4 million confirmed infections in the U.S."

As Democrats gathered virtually, Trump targeted voters in a pair of key swing states and sought to curry favour with women voters by pardoning Susan B. Anthony, a leader in the women’s suffrage movement.

In Arizona, one of the top 2020 battleground states, the president sought to paint a Biden victory in apocalyptic terms, insisting ""the survival of our nation is at stake"" in November, as he slammed what he hyperbolically labeled the ""insane and lethal policies"" of his opposition.

""Biden’s plan is the most radical, extreme, reckless, dangerous and deadly immigration plan ever put forward by a major party candidate,"" he said. ""It must be defeated. and it will be defeated on November 3.""

Trump repeatedly mischaracterized Biden’s views on immigration, which are more centrist than many others in his party. Biden, for instance, does not support abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and he argues that crossing the U.S. border illegally should be criminally prosecuted rather than made a civil offence, as many other top Democratic presidential hopefuls proposed.

With his second campaign trip in two days, Trump was hoping to halt an expected convention polling bump for his rival and shore up support with his focus on immigration, one of the most important issues to his political base. He was also trying to stanch an erosion in support among female voters with a symbolic nod on the centennial of the ratification of the 19th Amendment.

In recent weeks, Trump has been trying to build support within the pivotal female voter constituency and has stepped up his events aimed at women. His campaign has launched another ""women for Trump"" bus tour, and the president has embraced a ""law and order"" message with renewed vigour.

The president also worked in a last-minute stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, for a briefing about damage from the derecho last week that has left thousands without power and caused catastrophic damage across the battleground state. Many there have expressed outrage that their plight has not received more national attention.

The storm, which packed 100 mph winds and similar power to an inland hurricane, blew down trees, flipped vehicles and caused widespread damage.

""We’ve come through for you, and we will always come through for Iowa,"" Trump said, as the city's mayor urged him to consider enhanced federal disaster funding for people there.

Trump highlighted his immigration agenda during his stop in Yuma, and got an update on construction of his southern border wall. The president insisted that, in addition to fulfilling his pledge to build the wall, Mexico was also paying for it — even though they’re not.

""They are paying for it,"" he said as he stood in front of a replica of his wall, telling reporters he’s planning to enact a border crossing toll at some point in the future.

""Mexico will be paying,"" he said. ""We’re figuring how much we have to charge.""

Before leaving Washington, Trump held a White House event to announce the pardon of Anthony, convicted of voting in 1872 in violation of laws permitting only men to vote. But he quickly pivoted to the upcoming election and the issue of voting by mail.

""Win, lose or draw, we have to get it right,"" Trump said of the November vote count, levelling a fresh offensive against mail-in voting.

""You can’t have millions and millions of ballots sent all over the place, sent to people that are dead, sent to dogs, cats, sent everywhere,"" Trump said.

In fact, voter fraud has proved exceedingly rare. The Brennan Center for Justice in 2017 ranked the risk of ballot fraud at 0.00004% to 0.0009%, based on studies of past elections.

Only nine states have plans for ""universal"" mail-in voting, in which ballots are sent automatically to registered voters. Five of those states relied on mail-in ballots even before the coronavirus pandemic raised concerns about voting in person.

Trump's pardon announcement came on the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which ensured women the right to vote. The amendment states, ""The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex."" Congress passed it in 1919, and the amendment was ratified on Aug. 18, 1920.

Anthony was arrested for voting in Rochester, New York, and convicted in a widely publicized trial. Although she refused to pay the fine, the authorities declined to take further action.

""She felt the trial was the greatest miscarriage of justice because she had not had an opportunity to have a jury of her peers, and the jury didn’t get to vote,"" according to Deborah L. Hughes, president and CEO of The National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House in Rochester, where Anthony died in 1906.

""So to pardon her is to validate the trial, and she would not buy that idea at all,"" Hughes said.

Hughes said the question to ask on the anniversary is how she would want to be honoured. ""She would be the first to say if any president wanted to honour her, the best way to do that is to make sure there is no voter suppression anywhere in the United States,"" Hughes said.

Preparations for Trump's own acceptance speech next week were under way at the White House, where a stage was being erected on the South Lawn.

As was the case Monday in Minnesota and Wisconsin, Trump did not venture beyond the airports in Iowa or Arizona — a reflection of the new realities of campaigning in the midst of a pandemic. But Trump's Yuma rally felt much like his rallies of old, with a tightly packed crowd of hundreds shouting and cheering — though many were wearing ""TRUMP"" and ""MAGA"" masks.

“The majority of new infections in B.C. at this time are among young adults,” people who may have relatively mild infections but who can inadvertently spread it to more vulnerable populations, Gustafson said. “It is very important to remember that for our elders and those with underlying health conditions, the potential for severe disease remains. This may not apply to you, but you could easily spread the virus to someone who is vulnerable through your work or when spending time with friends and family.”

In B.C., 2,286 people are under public health monitoring for symptoms.

“Today we have a number of active outbreaks and community clusters and our public health teams on the ground are very proactively managing and following up these outbreaks, notifying close contacts, and doing all they can to break the chain of infection, but for us to be successful we actually need everybody to help,”Gustafson said.

From Friday to Monday the province announced 100 new cases — the second highest recorded number of single-day cases since the pandemic began, said B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix. There were 88 cases from Saturday to Sunday, and 48 cases Sunday to Monday, for a total of 236 people who have tested positive for COVID-19 in B.C.

Of the 4,594 cases in the province to date, there have been 1,419 cases in Vancouver Coastal Health, 2,425 cases in the Fraser Health Authority, 154 cases on Vancouver Island, 405 in the Interior Health Authority, and 117 in Northern Health Authority. Of those cases, 3,653 people have recovered.

On Monday, four people with COVID-19 were in hospital. Two new deaths, both in the Fraser Health region, were reported on for a total of 198 to date.

“I wanted to start on behalf of the premier, of the government, I think, all people in B.C., to send out our condolences to the families of the two people who died from Saturday to Sunday of COVID-19 in B.C., and to the 198 families in total, the 196 other families who’ve lost loved ones during the pandemic,” said Dix. “It is an extraordinarily difficult time right now to grieve.”

Dix said he spent the weekend engaged with young people, encouraging them to influence one another to do their part in not spreading COVID-19 “because this pandemic is not ending soon.

“This pandemic that we are all tired of, so very tired of, will be going on now, we would expect, will through 2021, into 2022,” said Dix.

“This new normal’s going to be in place for a long time and the way that we address that, the way we deal with that … has to be by choice and by engagement and by talking to each other and by encouraging one another and when we fall, helping one another up,” said Dix.

There are two new outbreaks in the health care system, in the Czorny Alzheimer Centre in the Fraser Health region, and the Arbutus Care Centre in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, for a total of 10 — nine in long-term care facilities and assisted living and one in acute care. There are no outbreaks in long-term care facilities on Vancouver Island.

On Friday, 7-Eleven announced an employee at its store on 1327 Douglas St., on the corner of Douglas and Johnson streets. Patrons in the store between Aug. 10 and Aug. 14 were asked to self monitor and call HealthLink BC at 811 for information.

The case of the7-Eleven employee was not addressed in the public update by the deputy provincial health officer on Monday and the Health Ministry could not be contacted for comment. Island Health has not issued an advisory. The store was open on Monday.

This weekend, Northern Health issued a community exposure alert for anyone who may have attended the It Is Time Canada event in Deadwood, Alta., from July 30 to Aug. 2. Attendees are asked to self-isolate for 14 days and monitor for symptoms.

The dry lightning came with little moisture and after record-breaking weekend temperatures that left forests tinder dry, said Dorthe Jakobsen, spokeswoman for the B.C. Wildfire Service’s coastal region.

article continues below

High temperatures are expected to continue until Thursday and the wildfire risk is considered extremely high.

Most of the fires, including blazes at Mount Healey and the Sooke Lake Reservoir area where Greater Victoria draws its water supply, were about one to four hectares in size on Monday afternoon. By late Monday, the Wildfire Service was reporting eight small wildfires around Sooke.

The Capital Regional District said residents may see smoke and air tankers in the vicinity while B.C. Wildfire and watershed protection crews “contain and supress two small wildfires” on a ridge top around the reservoir.

The CRD said there was no threat to water quality or infrastructure. “Multiple crews and aircraft are busy assessing,” a statement said. “Though smoke may be visible, the wildfires are currently small … the largest is four hectares.”

Initial response crews were travelling to the sites to assess the fires and fight them, Jakobsen said.

All of the new fires are south of Nanaimo, including a 2.5-hectare blaze at Meade Creek and four other fires north of Lake Cowichan, including Holland Lake. One of the blazes is close to Laketown Ranch in Youbou, site of the Laketown Shakedown music festival. The owners were on high alert as the fire was only about six kilometres away.

A lightning strike is believed to be the cause of a blaze near Muir Creek, west of Sooke, while there is a fire of unknown cause near Shirley. Lightning also sparked a blaze in a remote area of the San Juan Valley and the Bear Creek Reservoir north of Jordan River.

Several mid-Island fire departments worked on dousing a small brush fire in the Ladysmith area that was reported Sunday.

The fire is in a forested area near where Oyster Sto’Lo Road and the Trans-Canada Highway meet. The fire is believed to be a minor one, as the affected area of the forest is estimated less than one hectare.

“If it went unmanaged, of course it could become something significant,” said Mike Primrose of Ladysmith Volunteer Fire Department. “But they were on it pretty quick.”

The North Cedar Fire Department, Ladysmith Volunteer Fire Department, and the B.C. Wildfire Service all responded to the mutual-aid call.

Jakobsen said attack crews from the North Island, where there are no new fires, could be called south if the fires grow in size.

Environment Canada estimates there were about 1,600 lightning strikes across the province over the 12-hour period starting at 5 p.m. Sunday.

The B.C. Wildfire Service said there have been 415 fires across B.C. since April, burning a total area of 910 hectares. That includes 76 fires in the coastal region scorching 272 hectares.

The forecast calls for several more days of high temperatures before a large weather system brings rainfall on Thursday and Friday through much of the southern areas of the province, Jakobsen said.

Heat warnings remained in place Monday night for the Fraser Canyon, as well as the Okanagan, North and South Thompson, Cariboo and 100 Mile regions.

Environment Canada said 13 temperature records were broken or tied across southern B.C. on Sunday. The Fraser Canyon community of Lytton was the hot spot in Canada at 41.2 C, which broke the old record of 40.4 set 12 years ago.

One Island location set a new record on Sunday. Estevan Point on the Hesquiat Peninsula on the Island’s west coast hit 23.7 C, slightly higher than the previous mark set in 2012.

That’s because as juveniles, the fish experienced warmer-than-average river temperatures in the Fraser River.
But this year, especially and similar to last year, marine survival has been very low,” Michielsens said.
The Fraser River in good years has seen tens of millions of sockeye return, sustaining First Nations and commercial and recreational fisheries and their coastal communities.
A total 30,000 salmon have been counted above the slide, about 30 per cent of which are expected to be sockeye, Michielsens said.","The good news for this year’s troubled Fraser River salmon stocks is that high levels of freshwater run-off have been dropping in recent days, giving returning fish a better chance of making it past the Big Bar slide and to their home streams to spawn. But that boost is unlikely to offset the historically low return of 283,000 sockeye forecast for the run this year.

“Overall, the situation is quite dire. The run is returning at low levels,” said Catherine Michielsens, chief of fisheries management science for the Canada-U.S. Pacific Salmon Commission.

article continues below

“We have now seen enough of the run already to not expect any major surprises in terms of numbers being very different.”

It was already known that survival rates for this year’s Fraser River sockeye stocks would be below average, Michielsens said from Vancouver Thursday. That’s because as juveniles, the fish experienced warmer-than-average river temperatures in the Fraser River. They also faced above-average discharge levels in the river, making it more difficult to reach the ocean, she said. In the ocean, poor environmental conditions affecting their prey in the northeast Pacific hurt their survival rates as well.

“There’s a substantial decline in salmon productivity and that’s been occurring for quite a while. But this year, especially and similar to last year, marine survival has been very low,” Michielsens said.

The Fraser River in good years has seen tens of millions of sockeye return, sustaining First Nations and commercial and recreational fisheries and their coastal communities.

But there are no fisheries this year for Fraser River-bound sockeye because of conservation concerns.

The current low forecast follows last year’s previous historic low return of 485,900.

In 2018, a dominant cycle year for sockeye, which are on a four-year cycle, close to 11 million returned to the Fraser River, allowing for a total catch of 5.9 million fish.

So far this season, 65,000 sockeye and chinook salmon have been counted in the river below the Big Bar slide, 64 kilometres north of Lillooet.

A total 30,000 salmon have been counted above the slide, about 30 per cent of which are expected to be sockeye, Michielsens said.

The slide, reported in June last year, resulted in more than 85,000 cubic metres of rock shearing off a cliff into the river, where salmon were trapped below a five-metre tall waterfall. A natural fishway was built over the winter to allow salmon around the slide area.

Because discharge levels have dropped substantially in the past few days, the new fishway has been “successful at this point at allowing both sockeye and chinook to migrate above the side,” Michielsens said.

As well, a new salmon cannon will carry salmon past Big Bar. About 5,300 salmon have used the cannon this season and another 1,500 have been carried by truck, Michielsens said.

Tailored Brands, which also owns Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank stores, said over the weekend it will continue to operate most stores during restructuring and expected to reduce its funded debt by $630 million.

COVID-19 restrictions have severely limited weddings and office work since March, hitting the clothing retail and rental sectors particularly hard.

The three Island stores — including Nanaimo’s Brook’s Landing Mall and Westshore Town Centre in Langford — were shut down in March and reopened with reduced staff in late June.

Lawrence Larsen, manager of the Uptown store, said the three Island locations will continue to operate.

At least two stores — both in Surrey — have not reopened.

Larsen said the Uptown location is operating without 40 per cent of its usual staff.

He said sales since reopening have been “consistent, but overall the business is really down” from previous years.

Dinesh Lathi, chief executive of Tailored Brands, said in a statement to clients over the weekend the pandemic has altered the way people live and work.

“It means fewer in-person meetings, wedding celebrations and special events. Simply put, people are staying home more, and our clothes are better suited to being out and about,” Lathi said.

He said the company is “making major shifts” by creating a leaner structure to adapt to the realities of today’s retail environment.

“In July, we announced some store closures. However, we will continue to have stores across Canada operating as usual. Nothing about our decision to seek Chapter 11 protection changes that.”

Meanwhile, Lord & Taylor, the oldest retailer in the U.S., also said it was seeking bankruptcy protection over the weekend, lengthening the list of major retail chains that have faltered during the pandemic.

Household names, many longtime anchors in malls, were already struggling to keep up with consumers moving to online sales.

Lord & Taylor, which began as a Manhattan dry goods store in 1824, was sold to the French rental clothing company Le Tote Inc. last year. Both filed for bankruptcy protection, separately, on Sunday.

Lord & Taylor says it’s looking for a buyer.

Tailored Brands was struggling even before the pandemic lockdowns smothered any demand for suits or ties.

It wasn’t alone.

Last month, Brooks Brothers, the 200-year-old company that dressed nearly every U.S. president, filed for bankruptcy protection. Its rival, Barneys New York, is being dismantled after filing for bankruptcy last year.

Dozens of retailers, big and small, have filed for U.S. Chapter 11 protection this year. The pace through the first half of 2020 far exceeds the number of retail bankruptcies for all of last year. About two dozen U.S.-based chains have sought bankruptcy protection since the pandemic started.

Others include J. Crew, J.C. Penney, Neiman Marcus, Stage Stores, and Ascena Retail Group, which owns Lane Bryant in addition to Ann Taylor.

The five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations are upset that Ottawa decided to give a surplus allocation of salmon — which arose this year due to reduced recreational fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic — to commercial fishers rather than to the First Nations.

Clifford Atleo, lead negotiator for one of the nations who is also called Wickaninnish, says he feels sports and commercial troll fishers are given more rights to fish in the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

He says the latest decision to shut First Nations fishers out of an opportunity to catch more chinook salmon this year shows systemic racism is ""alive and well"" within the federal fisheries department.

""We feel very strongly we're not being dealt with fairly, we know we're not being dealt with fairly,"" Atleo said.

""It's just another layer of disappointment on the part of how the government deals with us. The government doesn't realize that their attitude toward our people is dyed-in-the-wool ... And I think the government — sometimes they don't realize they're being racist. They've got age-old policies that have never changed.""

A 2018 B.C. Supreme Court ruling directed Ottawa to take a more ""generous approach"" to allocations of chinook salmon to the First Nations given the importance of this species to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people.

The ruling from B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Humphries noted that the government's salmon allocation policy at the time gave recreational fisherman priority to fish for chinook and soho salmon ahead of the First Nations and advised the fisheries minister to reassess this policy.

Despite this ruling and changes that have since placed the First Nations at a higher priority than sport fishers, the Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ehattesaht and Mowachaht/Muchalaht nations say their yearly fishing allocations have not increased.

This year, the five First Nations were told they could fish 7,724 chinook, which amounts to just 1.5 fish per person for the 5,000 members of their communities.

COVID-19 brought a new dynamic to the salmon allocations this year, as fewer sport fishers were able to come due to pandemic restrictions. This means the recreational fleet is expected to catch 15,000 less salmon than was forecasted for this year, according to figures provided by the department.

None of this surplus is going to the First Nations.

""As per approved management plans, the Area G (commercial) harvest is adjusted based on the projected recreational harvests which results in an increase of 15,000 for 2020,"" said department spokesperson Athina Vazeos.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan was unavailable for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Jennifer Kuss, noted the improvements made in giving the five nations a higher priority in the yearly salmon catch allocations, as directed by the courts.

""This change ensures that food, social, and ceremonial (fishing) continues to be prioritized first, and additionally prioritizes the Five Nations rights-based sale fishery over the recreational and commercial fishery,"" Kuss said in a statement.

The Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations argue Ottawa could have provided some of the unused catch from this year to their people to help them support their remote communities. But Atleo said fisheries officials would not even engage in discussions about it.

""The government is trying to say they consult with us, they negotiate with us. They create their fishing plans, put it on the table and it's like take or leave it,"" Atleo said.

""All we want to do is be part of the economy, part of looking after ourselves without depending on government. We don't think that's a lot to ask.""

NDP MP Gord Johns, whose riding takes in the West Coast fishing shores, said he finds it ""disgusting"" the Trudeau government has repeatedly highlighted its desire to restore the Crown's relationship with Indigenous Peoples but has still fought many legal battles with these nations over their fishing rights.

""Indigenous people in our communities rely on this fishery for their economy, for their food security, for their culture. It's part of their way of life. These are salt water people and they rely on the salmon and to be denied their right is shameful, it's disgusting that the government is taking this approach.""

The First Nations are calling on Ottawa to revisit its decision on the surplus salmon for this year to allow them a portion of the additional catch.

""The government has an opportunity to fix this with these (surplus salmon) to come with a fair opportunity to exercise their commitment, in the judge's words, for a generous allocation to the nations and to start moving forward with reconciliation,"" Johns said.

The minister's spokeswoman says Jordan takes any allegations of systemic racism ""very seriously"" and that Ottawa is working with the five nations on a reconciliation agreement on fisheries resources, which is intended to broaden their access in the area, Kuss said.

""The road to reconciliation is a long journey, and Canada is committed to moving forward together. The department has spoken with the five nations on the reallocation of (salmon catch) on multiple occasions and that open dialogue will continue.""

The company already accepts credit cards. But having the tap function for both debit and credit cards is new. Passengers will also be able to use Apple Pay and Google Pay on smartphones, B.C. Ferries spokesperson Tessa Humphries said.

New PIN pads are being installed throughout B.C. Ferries operations this spring, with smaller terminals first to get the new technology.

“The larger terminals will happen towards the end of the month but by the end of March, we do expect to have debit ability at all the terminals,” Humphries said.

“We are aware and recognize that it [debit payment] is something that customers have been asking for quite some time and so we are excited that we can improve that experience and offer more payment options.”

B.C. Ferries anticipates ticketing will take less time for customers using the tap option, which has a $100 limit.

Credit cards — Visa, MasterCard and American Express — are already accepted for fares. Credit and debit cards can also be used on board the vessels.

B.C. Ferries starting offered a debit option on ferries in fall 2018.

Using debit for fares has not previously been available to passengers on major routes although it has been offered for northern routes which require reservations, Humphries said.

But with the busy southern routes, a debit option without a tap would have added a couple of seconds per transaction. On a long weekend or during the popular summer season, those seconds could add up to delays at terminals, she said.

“So we wanted to make sure that we did this right and that we allowed for pin pads that had the tap and pay capability before we rolled it out fleetwide,” Humphries said.

B.C. Ferries did tests that found between 75% and 80% of transactions fall under the $100 limit, she said.

The cost of adopting the new PIN pads is not being released, she said.

Debit is also an option now at certain smaller terminals and at self-service ticketing kiosks for foot passengers.

Smaller terminals already accepting debit for fare purchase are at Mill Bay, Brentwood Bay, Port Hardy, McLoughlin Bay (Bella Bella), Prince Rupert and Skidegate.

Self-service kiosks for walk-ons are at Tsawwassen, Swartz Bay, Horseshoe Bay, Departure Bay, Duke Point and Campbell River.

B.C. Ferries carries more than 22 million passengers and eight million vehicles annually. It has 37 vessels in its fleet, using 47 terminals.

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

""It was nice to get on the board tonight,"" said O'Reilly.

""I haven't been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it's just one game. I've got to be consistent with it.""

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

""When we take care of the puck it's effective and it's hard on them,"" said O'Reilly.

""I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We've got to stick to our structure.""

Pietrangelo said they've been working on fixing the penalty kill.

""We've been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,"" he said.

""Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.""

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

""They're blocking a lot of shots, they're studying us. They kind of know what we're doing,"" said Miller.

He said they'll make adjustments but aren't going to go back to square one.

""We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,"" he said.

""It's not like we're getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They're a good team. We're a good team. It's going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.""

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O'Reilly, last year's Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play — the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O'Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O'Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler's stick and in.

O'Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

All Western Conference games are being played in front of no fans at Rogers Place. The players are being kept isolated in a so-called bubble between games to prevent contracting COVID-19.

It was the spring of 2010 and Clune, who had made his NHL debut earlier that season, was finally on the road to getting the help the 23-year-old knew he needed in his crippling addiction battle.

article continues below

With his younger brother, Matt, at the wheel, they drove through upstate New York in a torrential downpour home to Toronto. Clune wasn't sure he was going to make it.

""I was in the acute withdrawal phase,"" he said in a recent interview with The Canadian Press. ""I couldn't sit still for a second. The most logical thing at that point in time for me was to go jump off a bridge ... literally.

""I couldn't really see myself coming out of it.""

But come out of it he did, and a decade later, Clune is sharing his story in ""Hi, My Name is Dicky,"" a raw documentary available on iTunes and AppleTV that details his life from aspiring youth hockey player to out-of-control junior antagonist to pro athlete teetering on the edge — one consumed by drugs, alcohol and mental illness.

His journey to recovery started in earnest on that lonely stretch of highway.

""My brother really had to talk me off the ledge,"" Clune said. ""When I see his face and when I see my other brother Ben's face, that's what gave me strength to live, because I didn't really want to live for myself at that time.

""Matt, at a couple points on that drive, had to do things that no younger brother should have to do and really dig down deep and get me home.""

The documentary from Taylor Prestidge and Haris Usanovic of Upper Canada Films tracks Clune's life and career, recovery and redemption. It includes interviews with Clune's parents, brothers, teammates and coaches.

Clune was driven to be the best as a child, but the pressure led him down a dark path at early age.

""I made that decision I was going to put my head down and not see anything but being a hockey player,"" Clune, who was selected in the third round of the 2005 NHL draft by the Dallas Stars, says in the film.

He began to try alcohol in his early teens as a way to cope, and it escalated quickly once he got to high school and then the Ontario Hockey League.

""I had this hole inside me that made me insecure and afraid of the world,"" Clune recounts. ""I got wasted and was like, 'Wow. OK. I'll be able to do this. I can cope with this. It's like a warm blanket.'

""Alcohol saved me. It was my solution to that problem of being self-absorbed and focused on all the things that made me insecure and self-conscious and in pain and sad.""

But he didn't realize how much of a spiral his life was taking. In junior, he would drive from bar to bar, party to party, drinking, smoking marjiuana and doing cocaine.

""I wanted to walk that line of looking death in the face every day, but still play hockey and do all these things,"" Clune says in the film. ""I don't know how I did it.""

Things got worse after junior when he was living in the United States by himself before making his NHL debut in that fateful 2009-10 season, months before becoming completely unglued.

""I had achieved my goal,"" he recalls on screen. ""But I hated myself.""

Clune eventually checked into rehab a second time — he went once before, but didn't stay — and committed to getting better with a lot of help from the people around him.

After he got out, he resumed his career and went onto play a total of 120 regular-season games in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Nashville Predators. His contract was bought out in 2015, and he was again at a crossroads — retire or keep going.

That's when the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were in the early stages of their massive rebuild, came calling to see if Clune wanted to be part of their program. They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club. At the very least, he would play in the minors and help foster a new culture.

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, who was in charge of the minor-league Marlies at the time, saw something in Clune that could be useful.

""He provides a certain energy,"" Dubas said. ""He provides experience in his life that I thought brought a great spirit to our team.""

Clune played 19 games with Leafs, but the forward truly made his mark with the Marlies. He helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018 and plans to continue his on-ice career, but equally important was how he's helped mentor a number of current NHLers.

He's proud of where he is, and not shy talking about how he got there. Clune still goes to meetings, does the 12 steps and now works to help others.

He also thinks a lot about why he made the decision to live, to fight, and get better, when many others — including some fellow pro hockey players — have gone down a different path.

""In the beginning, it was because I wanted to see my brothers,"" said Clune, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Then it transformed into wanting to live for myself. I started to discover what it feels like to have self esteem and to have love.

""I just hope people realize that they're not alone with how they feel. Don't be afraid to ask for help.""

And that includes how to allow players under contract to CFL teams the ability to sign elsewhere — most notably the NFL — if the opportunity arises. On Monday, the CFL cancelled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The focus right now for us on a few certain things and one of them is ensuring if there's an ability for our players to receive some form of payment this year,"" Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA's executive director, said Monday during a conference call. ""They should be able to do that if they have an opportunity.""

While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season. However, 66 players have currently opted out of participating in the 2020 campaign, which could create opportunity for some CFL players to sign deals south of the border and have a chance to earn a football paycheque, either on the active roster or on the practice squad.

While there's no shortage of collegiate players available, the advantage a CFL player has is pro experience, a fact not lost upon NFL personnel people.

The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign. This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.

And players on NFL practice rosters receive at least US$8,000 per week.

Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the CFL is amendable to doing what it can to help its players.

""Where we can do something we will,"" he said. ""We're going to be committed to working towards good outcomes, the best possible outcomes we can have with out players.

""That's not going to mean we're going to be able to do everything but we're certainly going to go into this with a real positive spirit.""

Something else that will be on the CFL-CFLPA radar will be the current collective bargaining agreement, which is slated to expire after the 2021 season. But union president Solomon Elimimian said the two sides covered a lot of ground this time around during talks to amend the agreement for a shortened '20 season.

""Whether we deal with '21 when it comes or after the '21 season I think there's hope there that we can work together,"" Elimimian said. ""Obviously the relationship between the players and the league needs to be one where the players feel appreciated.

""Everyone wants to the league to reach its full potential. The partnership has to be one that's very genuine and the players have to feel part of that. If that happens, the sky is the limit.""

Cavan Biggio also went deep for the Blue Jays and finished with three hits and three RBIs.

Ryu (2-1) struck out three and walked none. The left-hander permitted only one runner past second base and yielded just one extra-base hit to a team that came in ranked second in the majors with a .467 slugging percentage.

Rather than vie for strikeouts, Ryu said he was focused more on getting the Orioles to hit the ball weakly.

""I was able to keep them off balance,"" he said through an interpreter.

Signed in December to an $80 million, four-year contract, Ryu got off to a shaky start with Toronto in July before showing the form he displayed as a star with the Dodgers. He's given up a total of two runs in his last three starts after allowing eight runs over nine innings in his first two outings.

""That was vintage Ryu,"" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. ""Ryu was outstanding. That's the reason we won the game.""

The two home runs were a factor, but mostly Ryu was the difference-maker.

""They didn’t give Ryu that big contract for nothing,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""You just never know what he’s going to throw. You don’t know what side of the plate he’s going to throw to. He’s really tough on right-handers because he can locate it in. You saw a lot of us get jammed.""

The Blue Jays took control with a four-run third against Alex Cobb (1-2). Three infield hits produced a run before Grichuk delivered a three-run drive over the centre-field wall. It was his third home run of the season, all in the last four games.

""Obviously, the pitch to Grichuk was middle middle and it was a poorly executed pitch,"" Cobb said. ""But most of the pitches that I had, I felt like I executed. I got the results.""

Cobb gave up five runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He’s winless in his last four starts.

After hitting 31 homers last year, Grichuk was batting fifth, sixth or seventh in the order this season before Montoyo decided to move him into the No. 2 spot Sunday to replace injured Bo Bichette. Over the past two games, Grichuk has two homers, four hits and six RBIs.

Pedro Severino and Renato Núñez had RBIs for the Orioles, who have dropped two straight after winning seven of eight.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Bichette (right knee sprain) had an MRI and will receive a second opinion on his injury, Montoyo said. Bichette leads Toronto with a .361 batting average.

Orioles: RH Dillon Tate (elbow contusion) came off the injured list and RH Evan Phillips was optioned to the team's alternate site.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: RH Nate Pearson (0-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his fourth start in his first big league season Tuesday night. Drafted 28th overall in 2017, the 23-year-old is looking to rebound after giving up four runs to Miami last week in 2 1/3 innings. ""I'm developing at the highest level,"" Pearson said Monday. ""When I don't have my best stuff, I'm going to struggle.""

Orioles: LH Wade LeBlanc (1-0, 7.13) has allowed a combined 10 runs over 12 innings in his last three starts.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

""We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,"" Marchand said. ""That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.""

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

""We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do — little battles,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.""

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President's Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk's first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy's hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina's captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy putaway from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston's first six post-season games.

""There's other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.""

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen's late goal.

""That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,"" Williams said. ""We got it handed to us.""

NOTES: David Pastrnak had a goal and an assist in Boston’s double-overtime win in Game 1, but hasn’t played since. He had 48 regular-season goals to tie Washington’s Alex Ovechkin for the league lead. … Carolina played without 20-year-old Andrei Svechnikov, who was injured when his leg twisted awkwardly beneath him late in the third period of Saturday's loss. ... DeBrusk scored his 12th and 13th playoff goals since his 2018 post-season debut. … The Hurricanes were also without D Joel Edmundson for the third straight game. … Jake Gardiner assisted on Williams’ first-period goal for his first post-season point with Carolina.

As he explored and ate his way around that city-state, it brought back tasty memories of my travels there many years ago.

I, too, ate my way around Singapore and what I was most fond of was their many hawker centres. They are outdoor food courts with numerous stalls each offering a different Southeast Asian-style dish, such as chicken rice, fish-head curry and chili crab.

article continues below

But what I remember most vividly is the satay. Threading small, marinated pieces of chicken, meat or fish, or prawns, on bamboo skewers is how satay is made. When you see them cooking on a grill in Singapore at night time, the combination of the sultry tropical air, the orangey light from the charcoal-fuelled flames, the alluring scent of the bamboo and the appearance of the mouth-watering, sizzling satay all combine to make you want to eat them, now.

Just thinking of them again made we want to have some and, with no current plans to visit Singapore, I made my own. You’ll find the recipe below along with one for peanut sauce, for dipping.

Before threading on the marinated chicken, you need to soak the bamboo skewers in water to help prevent them from catching on fire when set on the grill. But even when you do that they still can ignite. That explains why in Singapore you see grills with a long narrow strip of metal about 10 to 15 centimetres wide on one side. When the satay is set on the grill, the meat portion is placed over the fire. The wood portion rests on the fire-insulted strip of metal, preventing the exposed part of the skewer from catching on fire.

As noted in a previous story on satay, to recreate this on my propane barbecue, I set a double thick strip of aluminum foil of similar width on the front portion of my grill. I then heat the grill to medium-high and set the meat portion of the skewer over the flame, and the meatless end on the foil. This technique, along with soaking the skewers in water, should prevent the exposed parts of wood from igniting.

Chicken Satay

Small cubes of chicken, spicily marinated Southeast Asian-style, are threaded on skewers and then grilled until charred, succulent and delicious. Serve the satay as an appetizer, or as a main-course, with rice and stir-fried vegetables.

Preparation time: 40 minutes, plus marinating time

Cooking time: about six minutes

Makes: Four servings (five satay each)

2 Tbsp vegetable oil, plus some for grill

2 Tbsp brown sugar

2 large garlic cloves, minced

1 tsp salt, or to taste

1 tsp finely grated fresh ginger

1 tsp ground coriander 1/2 tsp ground cumin

1/2 tsp ground turmeric

1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper

1 medium lime, finely grated zest and juice of

700 grams (about 10) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into small, about 3/4-inch, cubes 20 bamboo skewers (see Note)

cilantro sprigs or mint sprigs, sliced cucumber and onion, for serving (optional)

• peanut sauce (see recipe below)

Combine the 2 Tbsp vegetable oil, sugar, garlic, salt, ginger, coriander, cumin, turmeric, cayenne and lime zest and juice in bowl large enough to hold the chicken. Add the chicken and turn to coat. Cover chicken and marinate in the refrigerator four hours.

While chicken marinates, soak the skewers in cold water until needed. When chicken has marinated, thread four or five pieces of it on one end of each skewer (see Eric’s options).

Preheat your barbecue or indoor grill to medium high. Lightly oil the bars of the grill. Set on the satay and cook about six minutes, turning occasionally, or until cooked through. Arrange satay on a serving platter and garnish, if desired, with cilantro sprigs (or mint sprigs, cucumber and onion. Serve satay with the peanut sauce, for dipping.

Note: Bamboo skewers are sold at many supermarkets and stores selling kitchenware.

Eric’s options: You can skewer the chicken many hours before cooking the satay. Keep satay refrigerated until ready to grill. Any satay you won’t eat now could be frozen, uncooked. When needed, thaw and grill as directed. Small cubes of beef sirloin, pork leg or lamb leg could be used instead of chicken.

Peanut Sauce

Rich, savoury, peanutty sauce you can dunk the chicken satay in.

Preparation time: Five minutes

Cooking time: a few minutes

Makes: about one cup

1/3 cup peanut butter (see Note 1)

1 (5.6 oz/165 mL) can coconut milk (see Note 2)

1 medium lime, juiced and zested

3 Tbsp soy sauce

1 Tbsp brown sugar

1 Tbsp water

1 tsp finely grated fresh ginger

• pinch ground cayenne pepper

Place the ingredients in a small pot. Set over medium heat, bring to a simmer and whisk until smooth. Simmer two minutes. Serve sauce warm or at room temperature (see Eric’s options).

Note 1: I used local Island Nut Roastery peanut butter when testing this recipe. For more information about it, including stores that sell it, go to their website islandnutroastery.com. I’ve also made this sauce with smooth styles of peanut butter.

Note 2: You’ll find smaller sized cans of coconut milk for sale alongside the larger cans of it at some supermarkets. I you can’t find it, buy a larger can, use a scant 3/4 cup of it for the peanut sauce, and save the rest for another use or freeze it for another time.

Eric’s options: You can make the peanut sauce up to a day before needed. If you do, cool it to room temperature and then cover and refrigerate unto needed. When you do need it, warm it up, until fluid again. Thin sauce with a little more water, if you find it thick.

After making it, I pondered what to serve with it, leafed through my Italian cookbooks for inspiration and opted to make suppli al telefono.

Suppli are similar to Sicilian-style arancini; orange-shaped (arancia is the Italian word for orange) balls of crumb-coated risotto rice fried until golden. Suppli, though, are egg-shaped, Roman-style rice croquettes stuffed with mozzarella cheese.

article continues below

When you pull the cooked suppli apart, the strands of melted cheese in the middle resemble old-fashioned telephone wires. It’s why this dish is playfully called “suppli al telefono.”

Suppli are delicious and went very well with my summer tomato sauce. But they do take a bit of time to make and my step-by-step photos will guide you.

You can serve the suppli as an appetizer or as a main-course, with a side salad or grilled summer vegetables.

Suppli al Telefono

Italian-style rice croquettes, stuffed with cheese and basil, coated in breadcrumbs, then fried until golden and very delicious.

Preparation time: 60 minutes

Cooking time: about 50 minutes

Makes: 16 suppli

4 1/3 cups chicken or vegetable stock, plus more if needed

2 Tbsp olive oil

2 cups risotto rice (see Note)

1/2 medium onion, finely diced

1 large garlic clove, minced

2/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

2 large eggs, beaten

• salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

16 medium fresh basil leaves

16 (3/4-inch square) mozzarella cheese (about 125 to 150 grams)

3/4 cup dried breadcrumbs

• vegetable oil, for frying

• warm tomato sauce, to taste (see recipe below and Eric’s options)

Place stock in a pot and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. When simmering, turn heat to it’s lowest setting.

Heat olive oil in a second pot set over medium, medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook and stir until tender, about five minutes. Add rice and garlic and cook and stir two minutes more.

Pour in 1 cup of the stock, lowering the heat as needed so that it very gently simmers.

Simmer until that stock is almost fully absorbed by the rice. Slowly add remaining stock in 1/3-cup increments, cooking and stirring until it’s almost fully absorbed by the rice before adding the next 1/3-cup. It should take about 20 minutes to use up all the stock and at that point the rice should look thick and creamy and just be tender (al dente), with a tiny bit of firmness when bitten into.

Remove rice from the heat and stir in Parmesan cheese. Spread rice out on a baking sheet and cool to room temperature. Thoroughly mix the beaten eggs into the rice and season with salt and pepper.

Line a second baking sheet with parchment paper. Put the breadcrumbs into a shallow bowl.

To make suppli, divide the rice into 16 portions, each about 1/3 cup. Dampen your hands with cold water, lift up a portion of the rice and set a basil leaf and piece of cheese in the centre of it. Shape rice into an egg-shaped ball, ensuring the cheese and basil is completely encased by the rice. Fill and form the remaining portions of rice into suppli as you did the first one. When you do, occasionally dampen your hands with water again to help prevent the rice from sticking.

Coat suppli in breadcrumbs and set on the parchment paper-lined baking sheet (see Eric’s options).

Pour three inches of vegetable oil into a deep pot (see Eric’s options). Set over medium-high heat and warm oil to 350 F, or until a small cube of bread fries gold brown in about 15 seconds when dropped into the oil.

Preheat oven to 200 F. Working in batches of three or four, fry the suppli about three and a half to four minutes, until rich golden brown and hot in the centre. Drain on paper towel and set the cooked suppli on a clean baking sheet and keep warm in the oven while you fry the rest. Serve the suppli with tomato sauce.

Note: Rice for risotto is sold at most supermarkets. Bags of it are sometimes simply labeled “risotto rice” or “Italian rice.” You’ll also find specific varieties of rice that are good for risotto, such as arborio, carnaroli or vialone nano.

Eric options: You can make the suppli many hours in advance. Cover and refrigerate until ready to fry. The suppli can also be frozen. If you do that, thaw them before frying.

The suppli could also be fried in a deep fryer. If you don’t want make your own tomato sauce, serve the suppli with a store-bought one, such as passata di pomodoro (strained tomatoes).

Summer Tomato Sauce with Basil

In-season, ripe, red tomatoes cooked and then blended into a sauce you can serve with suppli al telefono and other Italian-style dishes, such as pasta. It yields more sauce than you’ll need for the suppli, but the leftover sauce, once cooled, will freeze well.

Preparation time: 25 minutes

Cooking time: About 20 minutes

Makes: About 3 1/2 to 4 cups

2 1/2 lbs. ripe red tomatoes (see Note 1)

2 Tbsp olive oil

1/2 medium onion, diced

• pinch or 2 fennel seeds, coarsely crushed (optional; see Note 2)

• pinch red pepper flakes

16 medium fresh basil leaves, or to taste

• salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cut stem end out of each tomato; mark a shallow X at the top of the blossom end. Plunge tomatoes, a few at a time, into the boiling water for 60 seconds, or until the skins start to loosen. Use a slotted spoon to lift tomatoes out of the water, set on a wide plate and cool a few minutes, until safe enough to handle.

Pull the skins off the tomatoes. Cut each tomato in half. Set a fine sieve over a bowl. Squeeze or pull out the seeds from each tomato half into the sieve. Use a whisk to push out as much liquid as you can from the tomato seed mixture. Compost the seeds and skins.

Set the seeded tomato halves on a large cutting board and coarsely chop. Set the chopped tomatoes and the juices on the board in the bowl with the strained tomato seed liquid in it.

Heat oil in a medium pot set over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until tender, about five minutes.

Add the chopped tomatoes to the pot. Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the tomatoes are very tender and falling apart, about 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in the basil.

Purée the tomato sauce in the pot with an immersion (hand) blender. The puréeing could also be done in a food processor or blender. Taste and season the tomato sauce with salt and pepper and it’s ready.

Note 1: Ripe, deep red tomatoes good for making sauce include an heirloom variety called oxheart, beefsteak tomatoes, ultra sweet tomatoes and/or roma (plum) tomatoes.

Note 2: You can coarsely crush the fennel seeds in a spice grinder, or by placing them in a thick plastic bag and hitting them with a kitchen hammer.

The phrase quickly became a rallying cry to change course, taking advantage of the break in business as usual.

The serious challenges we currently face include the environmental crisis, pandemics, cyber warfare, terrorism and a renewed nuclear threat, among others. All are global. Our greatest strengths, on the other hand, are dedicated individuals working in common cause. To take a look at our options in aligning our strengths and challenges, we need to exit the news cycle to examine an interesting bit of inconvenient history.

article continues below

When the UN Charter was created 75 years ago it was reluctantly permitted a concession deemed necessary for the Charter’s acceptance by Stalin’s Russia and the United States Congress, both flush with victory from the Second World War. They, along with France, the UK and China, were given veto power over UN Security Council decisions, effectively giving five nations disproportionate power.

The framers of the 1945 Charter also incorporated plans for a Charter review conference, to be held within 10 years. Unfortunately, the Cold War and inertia set in, and that conference never happened. Many decades later, the United Nations presides with great difficulty over a world still desperately in need of global governance that is just, effective and inclusive.

The need for unity in the international sphere is greater than ever. A belief in that unity has inspired me along with generations of other Bahá’ís. “The well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established,” said Bahá’u’lláh, the founder of the Bahá’í faith. “It is not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country, but rather for him who loveth the whole world. The earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens.”

That idealistic spirit is alive and well. A young generation of problem-solvers from every background has arisen around the world, often motivated by environmental concerns. Together First, Common Home for Humanity, Ocean Unite, Simpol and Democracy Without Borders are incredibly promising international initiatives. If we’re to move forward together, we need to give such organizations our full attention.

The visceral, entertaining forms of politics make the news, but it’s the quiet, hard-working efforts that tend to change the course of history. Unfortunately, disillusioned with corruption and polarization, many believe that things were just fine before we had global problems and global institutions, if only we could turn back the hands of time – although they weren’t and we can’t.

The drama plays out against a backdrop of cynicism and despair, which in itself hampers progress. Still, enormous changes can begin almost imperceptibly. Beginning in 1993, Canada was followed by the European Parliament, the PanAfrican Parliament and the World Federation of United Nations Associations, all calling for the establishment of a UN Parliamentary Assembly (UNPA) to help correct the “democratic deficit” in global decision-making. The UNPA Campaign may provide a solution to decades of broken environmental promises, since democracy is essential to a legitimate capacity to enact laws.

There are several proposed routes towards bringing greater justice and the rule of law to the international sphere. (See the Times Colonist 5 August article in the online Spiritually Speaking blog for links.) The United Nations needs to follow its advice and “Build Back Better”, with support and assistance from civil society. It’s up to us, as world citizens, to pay attention and do what we can.

A spiritually oriented person for most of my adult life, I thought initially that I would find this change an opportunity to dig deeper. Well, that quickly became sheer necessity! I had no idea how wired I was into the physical patterns of attachment to dear ones. Being brought up in a large family, with hugging, arm-in-arm walking, and affection being the norm, I’m learning to ‘hug’ from a distance, to fill the six feet between me and others with warm love.

So how to go deeper, to find that wellspring of comfort and love that we in ECKANKAR call the ECK or Spirit?

article continues below

We have some tools. Sacred words, the most universal being an ancient name of God, ‘HU’ (rhymes with you), can express the vibration and the sound of Divine Love. Sung on a single note on the outgoing breath, HU can be used aloud or silently, as a single utterance or as a song or chant for as long as needed or desired. Lately I have needed to sing it a little longer to calm myself and gain entry into the Light and Sound of God. But once I arrive there, I am filled with gratitude, relaxation and a desire to go further. Of course, I cannot spend my whole day sitting quietly chanting HU. However, I can pause in the supermarket when someone scowls at me or I accidentally turn into the wrong aisle, and inwardly sing a few HUs to regain my balance. Or when I get back in the car after a hyper alert visit to the hospital to drop my husband off for surgery, I can take a moment and sing HU to bring myself into harmony with life. I find it helps with the acceptance of what is going on.

So, our inner being is getting a real workout. We are, perhaps, finding areas that we thought we had put aside forever or no longer needed to resolve. Deep questions may arise. Answers are found when we can access profound love and gratitude for this experience called life. In ECKANKAR, we have a living master, a guide and support who not only teaches us through talks and books, but is also available for personal guidance in contemplation and dreams. His inner being, the Mahanta consciousness, embodies Divine Love to such a degree that he uplifts those with whom he comes into contact, physically, or in the inner realms. To reach him in your contemplations, it is helpful to focus on love, a beautiful idea or quote, or to visualise his face or that of someone you love. Sometimes this consciousness can be seen within as a blue light or ball of light. You may hear a voice or the sounds of the inner planes. If you receive direction from a voice in this state, it will only direct you to kind, loving thoughts and actions. Anything negative or hurtful is not a manifestation of the Mahanta, the Living ECK Master.

If we are to grow and benefit from this worldly experience of isolation, deprivation, and worldwide awareness, we need to dig deeper, to find the key that dwells in our hearts, and practice living in the Love that comes from the essence of life. Some call it God, Allah, Brahma. In ECK, we call It Sugmad, the Ocean of Love and Mercy. It can be found by using the HU sound to go within.

Early this week, there was a flutter of consternation within the arts community over COVID-19, the virus that’s now reached pandemic proportions. By Thursday night, announcements of show cancellations — some of them last-minute — had swelled from a trickle to a fast-flowing river.

I first heard of this Thursday. That night, I was set to attend a performance of Lillian Hellman’s The Children’s Hour staged by University of Victoria’s Phoenix Theatre. Then Adrienne Holierhoek, the theatre’s publicist, emailed me with sobering news: the performance was cancelled.

“We’re not going ahead with a public performance, as we’re on the verge of the 250 limit,” she said. Holierhoek would now spend a busy night doing damage control.

She added wryly: “Let’s just say I’m having granola bars for dinner.”

As is the case with many performing arts companies in Victoria and throughout the province, the cancellation was in deference to a recommendation by B.C. health officer Bonnie Henry. On Thursday she suggested cancelling events expected to draw crowds of 250 or more to help contain the highly contagious virus.

That night, the list of cancellations continued to grow. Pacific Opera Victoria’s production of Flight of the Hummingbird, set to run Friday to March 22, is postponed indefinitely. The Victoria Symphony has discontinued its concerts. Dance Victoria says this weekend’s performances of Romeo + Juliet by Ballet B.C. are cancelled.

The Royal and McPherson theatres are closed until further notice.

Yesterday morning, I sat down to write a review of Busted Up: A Yukon Story, which played the Belfry Theatre’s Spark Festival. It’s a first-rate show and was to conclude its run tonight.

Later that morning, the Belfry’s communications director, Mark Dusseault, told me his company had made the difficult decision to cancel further Spark Festival performances. This festival, a showcase of new theatre, was originally to continue to March 22.

“It’s heartbreaking,” said Dusseault.

A decision had to be made quickly. One company was preparing to fly to Victoria from its home province of Newfoundland for Spark shows. The Belfry didn’t want them to invest effort, time and expense, only to learn their run was canceled.

Langham Court Theatre has cancelled today’s final performances of I and You.

Manager Michelle Buck said Langham Court originally considered capping the audience at 75 (the theatre’s capacity is 175) to allow for “social distancing” — that is, leaving physical spaces between attendees.

But in the end, the company — regretfully — decided to play it safe.

“It’s such a good little show,” Buck said. “It’s sad to pull it from underneath them.”

Dusseault, who has worked in theatre for 30 years, cannot remember a situation like this ever occurring before in Victoria. Yes, there have been other calamities: 9/11, the Gulf War, the global SARS outbreak of 2003. But nothing ever shut down the arts scene like COVID-19 has.

Not every theatre company has closed its doors. Blue Bridge Repertory Theatre says no upcoming events at its Roxy Theatre have been cancelled. The Roxy will host a musical tribute to the Beatles March 26 to 29.

It is, of course, disappointing for audiences when performances are cancelled. You not only miss out on the show, there’s the task of getting a refund. Yet for arts organizations, the fallout from this situation is much more profound.

Many companies scrape by to survive. Over the past 30 years, government funding has eroded. Audiences for opera, classical music and theatre are getting older. And in general, the battle for audiences is becoming much more intense.

For example, years ago, direct-to-consumer services such as Netflix didn’t even exist.

A new meme now making the social-media rounds suggests people holding tickets to cancelled shows should consider opting out of a refund. By doing so, you make a donation to the company in question.

It’s a noble notion worth considering. One potential legacy of COVID-19 is that it will shut down some arts organizations permanently. And once they go under, it’s difficult — if not impossible — to resurrect them.

Ours is a culturally rich city. During this difficult time, let us be aware of that, of the fragility and importance of the arts in Victoria."

For instance, there was John Green’s The Fault in Our Stars (2012), a young adult novel (subsequently a film) about a girl with cancer who falls for a boy suffering from the same.

And there’s the 2019 movie Five Feet Apart, about a young woman with cystic fibrosis who becomes romantically involved with an ailing young man.

article continues below

Langham Court Theatre has just opened Lauren Gunderson’s 2014 play I and You. In this two-actor drama, Caroline, a high-school student with a serious liver ailment, receives a surprise visit from a classmate. Like a cactus flower in an inhospitable desert, young love ultimately blooms.

Caroline — feisty and smart — has never before met Anthony, a decent young man with a heart as big as Kansas. At the beginning, in true rom-com style, the pair spar and bicker furiously before bonding like Super Glue.

I and You was a hit, gleaning critical acclaim and enjoying well over 20 productions since it debuted. Gunderson has, meanwhile, emerged as one of America’s most produced playwrights.

Some will find I and You a touch jejune and sentimental in the manner of after-school TV specials.

A melodramatic surprise ending will leave you either thrilled or groaning. There’s a distinctly YA-lit vibe throughout this 90-minute play (I kept thinking of the classic line, “Stay gold, Ponyboy,” from S.E. Hinton’s The Outsiders).

An audience noticeably younger than Langham Court’s usual crowd responded enthusiastically to Thursday’s opening performance. Certainly this production of I and You, capably directed by John Han, has its share of strengths.

The show benefits from the talents of two promising actors. Jesse Deutscher (Caroline) and Justin Francis Lee (Anthony) offered well-rehearsed, energetic performances.

The detailed set is terrific — Caroline’s bedroom is stuffed with groovy teen detritus: vintage Elvis poster, lava lamp, cat-scratching post, retro-lamps and so on. Wide-screen clips of computer games and music videos work well; all light, video and sound cues were handled adroitly.

The play commences with Anthony, wearing a backward baseball cap, dropping in unannounced. He spouts a cryptic line that turns out to be a quote from Walt Whitman’s famous poem Song of Myself.

Caroline — a tiny girl in a too-big sweatshirt — is bewildered and frightened. Anthony hastily explains he’s volunteered to be her partner for a school assignment. Nonetheless Caroline, who is homebound because of her liver ailment, lashes out at the intruder for 20 or 30 minutes.

This introductory section is heavily salted with sitcom teen speak. “What is wrong with you, super hater?” says Anthony. “Walt Whitman can bite me,” says Caroline.

Eventually she does agree to a partnership — they’ll create a Whitman-inspired poster together. “How do you feel about glitter?” Caroline asks. “Philosophically I’m agnostic on glitter,” says Anthony.

It’s doubtful anyone outside a Neil Simon (or Lauren Gunderson) play actually speaks like this. Happily, about halfway through, the quip-fest subsides and we get to know the characters a little more.

Bon mots on the benefits of Chunky Monkey ice cream and Caroline’s toy turtle give way to heavier subjects. Anthony turns out to be a John Coltrane devotee; she digs Jerry Lee Lewis.

Caroline is a gifted photographer with a Whitman-esque love for minutia; he has just witnessed a terrible tragedy on the basketball court.

Deutscher, as Caroline, sometimes displayed flashes of nuance and a knack for subtle facial expression. And the more the playwright eased up on the shallow-end-of-the-pool banter, the more Lee was able to dig into the character of Anthony.

Gunderson intends to say something brave and refreshing about the fleeting, transcendent beauty of life — never a bad thing. And if I and You sends you back to that tattered copy of Walt Whitman poems on your bookshelf, so much the better.

The show continues at Langham Court to March 14."

It isn’t Hyundai’s least expensive vehicle yet, but it soon may be. In some markets, Hyundai has already discontinued the Accent, its current five-door subcompact hatchback, giving the Venue the crown. But that hasn’t happened in North America — yet.

The Venue comes in four trim levels, with my tester, the Ultimate model, carrying a sticker price of $24,899.

The Venue is aimed at the urban first-time buyer, and it appeals to that group with a budget-friendly price. Despite its diminutive dimensions, its boxy body contains ample room for friends and cargo.

Headroom is a generous 1,000 millimetres in the front and 980 mm in the back. Legroom is 1,050 front and 870 mm back, with passenger interior volume pegged at 2,602 litres.

My tester had the Ultimate trim level — the fanciest — with premium items more commonly found in luxury brands. The interior is simple, uncluttered and logically arranged.

Comfort items that I didn’t expect include a heated steering wheel, power sunroof, push-button start and climate control.

The rear seatbacks fold 60/40 and the cargo floor has two positions. Cargo capacity is 335 litres with the seats up and 1,148 with them down.

The infotainment system consists of an eight-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability. The menus were easy to decipher and the system response time was good.

Technophiles will appreciate Hyundai’s BlueLink connected vehicle system, which allows users to access some functions — such as remote vehicle lock or unlock, remote start and remote climate control via their smartphone.

The system even has an automatic collision notification function that will call for emergency services in case of a crash.

My tester had navigation built-in, but lesser trims don’t offer that feature.

There is only one engine available, a 1.6-litre four cylinder producing 121 horsepower and 113 pound-feet of torque.

A manual transmission is available — but only in the base model. Every other trim gets a continuously variable transmission).

Power is delivered to the front wheels only — there is no all-wheel-drive option. As if to compensate, drivers can choose a Snow option along with Normal and Sport modes.

Let’s be frank, that last mode is more optimistic than fact. If you do choose Sport, the engine rpms go up, but you don’t really go faster.

If performance is what you’re after, you really should consider the Kona, the Venue’s bigger brother.

Fuel economy is 8.0 litres per 100 km in the city and 7.0 on the highway.

Compared with the Nissan Kicks, another subcompact SUV, power output and fuel consumption are similar.

With a 2,520-mm wheelbase and a 5.1-metre turning radius, the Venue is refreshingly nimble in the city. Unfortunately, the short wheelbase also results in a choppy ride on rough roads.

Apart from premium touches in the cabin, the Ultimate also impresses with its safety suite.

You get forward collision-avoidance assist (with automated emergency braking), lane-departure warning with lane-keeping assist, driver-attention warning, blind-spot collision warning with lane-change assist and rear cross-traffic warning.

While these features have become more common of late thanks to trickle-down effect of technology, it is the first time an entry-level model (albeit the highest trim in the line) has been so equipped.

With certain models, the Venue contrasts its entry-level stigma with a trendy/hip vibe, with eye-catching two-tone paint schemes and flashy wheels.

The Venue might be inexpensive to start. It can even be plain. But dress it up and you can go to town — and that’s the point.

SUVs and crossovers are everywhere these days. And every day you hear of a manufacturer introducing larger and larger models that can carry more cargo and passengers.

Lexus has quietly gone the other way, with a model that hits all the high notes in a subcompact body.

It is a segment that has seen a number of luxury entrants, from the Volvo XC40 to the BMW X1.

But Lexus has a winning card up its sleeve.

Luxury brands traditionally play up on their vehicle’s performance versus regular brands. Lexus, on the other hand, can tout their fuel efficiency as a trump card instead.

The UX is available as the 200, with a 2.0-litre four-cylinder that produces 168 horsepower, or the 250h, with an Atkinson-cycle 2.0-litre gasoline engine mated with Lexus’ fourth-generation electric hybrid system that cranks out a combined 181 hp.

I drove the latter car with the F Sport Series 2 package.

If you like luxury, yet want to drive something socially conscious at the same time, the UX hybrid is your vehicle.

With a gentle foot, you could be able to consume a miserly 5.7 litres of fuel per 100 kilometres in the city and 6.2 on the highway.

The hybrid drivetrain technology, from parent Toyota, works seamlessly and effectively. While the competition fits engine stop/start to its vehicles, the electric motor in the hybrid drive in the UX provides propulsion until about 10 km/h.

The UX will, under light load, revert to electric power even at higher speeds. The transition is completely transparent — the only way you can tell is when the vehicle tells you of the change.

A drive-mode selector allows you to choose Eco or Sport if you find the middle-of-the-road Normal setting not aggressive enough for your driving style.

Choose Sport when you desire an extra urgency to your drive, but don’t expect too much. The UX will get from zero to 100 km/h in about nine seconds.

The regular UX is front-wheel-drive only. The hybrid UX sends engine power to the front wheels via a CVT transmission and uses an electric motor to power the rear wheels, making it all-wheel drive.

If you choose to take to the back roads, you will find the UX 250h a pleasant companion.

My tester had the F Sport package, which includes a sport-tuned suspension and 18-inch wheels, among other performance upgrades.

The interior is a knockout, with an edgy design and a youthful vibe. My tester had an attractive contrasting red-on-black colour scheme.

The traditional analog gauges have been replaced by an eight-inch customizable digital display in front of the driver.

The 10.3-inch infotainment screen is on the top of the dash. It is flanked by an conventional analog clock — a nice, classy touch.

The system is hamstrung by a too-sensitive touchpad controller that I found frustrating to use.

As if to compensate, Lexus has relocated the audio system’s volume and tuning knob to the outside edges of the centre console. It’s an unconventional location, but it works great once you are used to it.

Although the UX may be the least-expensive Lexus, you wouldn’t know when sitting in it. Fit and finish is excellent, with attention to detail evident throughout. My tester was the top of the line and came with items such as heated and ventilated front seats, power adjustable seat belts, a premium audio system and supportive seats.

The only thing that Lexus could not change is the tight rear quarters. If you are on the tall side, you might want to think twice about having anybody sit behind you.

The cargo capacity on par with this segment, with 486 litres of capacity.

However, the liftover height makes it difficult to load heavy cargo. That’s disappointing because there doesn’t seem to be anything — not even a spare tire — underneath the floor.

The UX comes with a comprehensive driver-assistance suite. Standard features include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, bicycle and pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning, lane-tracking assist and traffic-sign recognition.

The parking-assist system uses sensors to detect objects when you are backing up, and will apply the brakes automatically if it senses an imminent collision.

As the entry-level vehicle to the Lexus brand, the UX is well-suited to its role. It is affordable (for a luxury vehicle), looks attractive on the outside and the well-appointed cabin is a great place to dwell.

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

article continues below

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister.
""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.
""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.
MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.","OTTAWA — Chrystia Freeland shattered a glass ceiling Tuesday, becoming the first woman to be sworn in as Canada's finance minister.

The gravitas of the moment was not lost on the former journalist and mother of three. After she spoke the English words of her oath of office, she paused to take a deep breath, before repeating the oath in French.

article continues below

""It's about time,"" Freeland said later at a press conference on Parliament Hill.

She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.

Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.

But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.

""There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,"" said Turnbull. ""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.""

Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.

She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.

""We don't like their representative very much,"" he said of her in September 2018.

Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said ""Mama (does not equal) chopped liver."" On the back it said ""Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.""

When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.

And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.

""She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,"" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.

He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.

""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.

""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.

""I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,"" he said. ""And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.""

She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.

""What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,"" Kelly said on Twitter. ""This has been missing in the department for several years.""

MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.

While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.

Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.

Trudeau said Tuesday that she had been ""a key player in my government from day one.""

The five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations are upset that Ottawa decided to give a surplus allocation of salmon — which arose this year due to reduced recreational fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic — to commercial fishers rather than to the First Nations.

article continues below

Clifford Atleo, lead negotiator for one of the nations who is also called Wickaninnish, says he feels sports and commercial troll fishers are given more rights to fish in the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

He says the latest decision to shut First Nations fishers out of an opportunity to catch more chinook salmon this year shows systemic racism is ""alive and well"" within the federal fisheries department.

""We feel very strongly we're not being dealt with fairly, we know we're not being dealt with fairly,"" Atleo said.

""It's just another layer of disappointment on the part of how the government deals with us. The government doesn't realize that their attitude toward our people is dyed-in-the-wool ... And I think the government — sometimes they don't realize they're being racist. They've got age-old policies that have never changed.""

A 2018 B.C. Supreme Court ruling directed Ottawa to take a more ""generous approach"" to allocations of chinook salmon to the First Nations given the importance of this species to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people.

The ruling from B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Humphries noted that the government's salmon allocation policy at the time gave recreational fisherman priority to fish for chinook and soho salmon ahead of the First Nations and advised the fisheries minister to reassess this policy.

Despite this ruling and changes that have since placed the First Nations at a higher priority than sport fishers, the Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ehattesaht and Mowachaht/Muchalaht nations say their yearly fishing allocations have not increased.

This year, the five First Nations were told they could fish 7,724 chinook, which amounts to just 1.5 fish per person for the 5,000 members of their communities.

COVID-19 brought a new dynamic to the salmon allocations this year, as fewer sport fishers were able to come due to pandemic restrictions. This means the recreational fleet is expected to catch 15,000 less salmon than was forecasted for this year, according to figures provided by the department.

None of this surplus is going to the First Nations.

""As per approved management plans, the Area G (commercial) harvest is adjusted based on the projected recreational harvests which results in an increase of 15,000 for 2020,"" said department spokesperson Athina Vazeos.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan was unavailable for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Jennifer Kuss, noted the improvements made in giving the five nations a higher priority in the yearly salmon catch allocations, as directed by the courts.

""This change ensures that food, social, and ceremonial (fishing) continues to be prioritized first, and additionally prioritizes the Five Nations rights-based sale fishery over the recreational and commercial fishery,"" Kuss said in a statement.

The Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations argue Ottawa could have provided some of the unused catch from this year to their people to help them support their remote communities. But Atleo said fisheries officials would not even engage in discussions about it.

""The government is trying to say they consult with us, they negotiate with us. They create their fishing plans, put it on the table and it's like take or leave it,"" Atleo said.

""All we want to do is be part of the economy, part of looking after ourselves without depending on government. We don't think that's a lot to ask.""

NDP MP Gord Johns, whose riding takes in the West Coast fishing shores, said he finds it ""disgusting"" the Trudeau government has repeatedly highlighted its desire to restore the Crown's relationship with Indigenous Peoples but has still fought many legal battles with these nations over their fishing rights.

""Indigenous people in our communities rely on this fishery for their economy, for their food security, for their culture. It's part of their way of life. These are salt water people and they rely on the salmon and to be denied their right is shameful, it's disgusting that the government is taking this approach.""

The First Nations are calling on Ottawa to revisit its decision on the surplus salmon for this year to allow them a portion of the additional catch.

""The government has an opportunity to fix this with these (surplus salmon) to come with a fair opportunity to exercise their commitment, in the judge's words, for a generous allocation to the nations and to start moving forward with reconciliation,"" Johns said.

The minister's spokeswoman says Jordan takes any allegations of systemic racism ""very seriously"" and that Ottawa is working with the five nations on a reconciliation agreement on fisheries resources, which is intended to broaden their access in the area, Kuss said.

""The road to reconciliation is a long journey, and Canada is committed to moving forward together. The department has spoken with the five nations on the reallocation of (salmon catch) on multiple occasions and that open dialogue will continue.""

This latest extension will end on Sept. 1 and allows the government to manage immediate concerns, such as recent outbreaks in some areas of the province.

Premier John Horgan says B.C. residents have made sacrifices to keep transmission rates down, but now unsafe gatherings are eroding that progress.

The province announced 83 new cases on Tuesday for a total of 4,677 cases since the pandemic began.

No new deaths were reported, leaving the total number of fatalities at 198.

There are 775 active cases in B.C. and 2,326 people under monitoring because they have been exposed to someone who has been infected with COVID-19.

In a statement, Horgan says the government is committed to getting back on track and it will announce new enforcement measures against those who put others at risk.

""The vast majority of British Columbians are following Dr. Henry's orders of seeing fewer faces in bigger spaces, but we all have to remain committed to flattening the curve,"" he said.

The BC Wildfire Service said crews are responding to the fire on Christie Mountain about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, on the east side of Skaha Lake.

The fire is estimated at 250 hectares and firefighters on the ground are being supported by air tankers.

The service said the situation was ""rapidly evolving"" and asked everyone to stay clear of the area to avoid interfering with the operation.

The order asks residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with pets and critical items.

""We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,"" the service said in a tweet.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a ""fire of note"" on Tuesday.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was smouldering with no open flame but was considered out of control. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight.

Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Firefighters have tackled dozens of wildfires after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions.

Two fires were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

""It was nice to get on the board tonight,"" said O'Reilly.

""I haven't been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it's just one game. I've got to be consistent with it.""

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

""When we take care of the puck it's effective and it's hard on them,"" said O'Reilly.

""I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We've got to stick to our structure.""

Pietrangelo said they've been working on fixing the penalty kill.

""We've been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,"" he said.

""Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.""

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

""They're blocking a lot of shots, they're studying us. They kind of know what we're doing,"" said Miller.

He said they'll make adjustments but aren't going to go back to square one.

""We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,"" he said.

""It's not like we're getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They're a good team. We're a good team. It's going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.""

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O'Reilly, last year's Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play — the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O'Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O'Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler's stick and in.

O'Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

All Western Conference games are being played in front of no fans at Rogers Place. The players are being kept isolated in a so-called bubble between games to prevent contracting COVID-19.

They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club.","TORONTO — Richard Clune remembers the drive — the pain, the anxiety, the uncertainty, the fear.

It was the spring of 2010 and Clune, who had made his NHL debut earlier that season, was finally on the road to getting the help the 23-year-old knew he needed in his crippling addiction battle.

article continues below

With his younger brother, Matt, at the wheel, they drove through upstate New York in a torrential downpour home to Toronto. Clune wasn't sure he was going to make it.

""I was in the acute withdrawal phase,"" he said in a recent interview with The Canadian Press. ""I couldn't sit still for a second. The most logical thing at that point in time for me was to go jump off a bridge ... literally.

""I couldn't really see myself coming out of it.""

But come out of it he did, and a decade later, Clune is sharing his story in ""Hi, My Name is Dicky,"" a raw documentary available on iTunes and AppleTV that details his life from aspiring youth hockey player to out-of-control junior antagonist to pro athlete teetering on the edge — one consumed by drugs, alcohol and mental illness.

His journey to recovery started in earnest on that lonely stretch of highway.

""My brother really had to talk me off the ledge,"" Clune said. ""When I see his face and when I see my other brother Ben's face, that's what gave me strength to live, because I didn't really want to live for myself at that time.

""Matt, at a couple points on that drive, had to do things that no younger brother should have to do and really dig down deep and get me home.""

The documentary from Taylor Prestidge and Haris Usanovic of Upper Canada Films tracks Clune's life and career, recovery and redemption. It includes interviews with Clune's parents, brothers, teammates and coaches.

Clune was driven to be the best as a child, but the pressure led him down a dark path at early age.

""I made that decision I was going to put my head down and not see anything but being a hockey player,"" Clune, who was selected in the third round of the 2005 NHL draft by the Dallas Stars, says in the film.

He began to try alcohol in his early teens as a way to cope, and it escalated quickly once he got to high school and then the Ontario Hockey League.

""I had this hole inside me that made me insecure and afraid of the world,"" Clune recounts. ""I got wasted and was like, 'Wow. OK. I'll be able to do this. I can cope with this. It's like a warm blanket.'

""Alcohol saved me. It was my solution to that problem of being self-absorbed and focused on all the things that made me insecure and self-conscious and in pain and sad.""

But he didn't realize how much of a spiral his life was taking. In junior, he would drive from bar to bar, party to party, drinking, smoking marjiuana and doing cocaine.

""I wanted to walk that line of looking death in the face every day, but still play hockey and do all these things,"" Clune says in the film. ""I don't know how I did it.""

Things got worse after junior when he was living in the United States by himself before making his NHL debut in that fateful 2009-10 season, months before becoming completely unglued.

""I had achieved my goal,"" he recalls on screen. ""But I hated myself.""

Clune eventually checked into rehab a second time — he went once before, but didn't stay — and committed to getting better with a lot of help from the people around him.

After he got out, he resumed his career and went onto play a total of 120 regular-season games in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Nashville Predators. His contract was bought out in 2015, and he was again at a crossroads — retire or keep going.

That's when the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were in the early stages of their massive rebuild, came calling to see if Clune wanted to be part of their program. They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club. At the very least, he would play in the minors and help foster a new culture.

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, who was in charge of the minor-league Marlies at the time, saw something in Clune that could be useful.

""He provides a certain energy,"" Dubas said. ""He provides experience in his life that I thought brought a great spirit to our team.""

Clune played 19 games with Leafs, but the forward truly made his mark with the Marlies. He helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018 and plans to continue his on-ice career, but equally important was how he's helped mentor a number of current NHLers.

He's proud of where he is, and not shy talking about how he got there. Clune still goes to meetings, does the 12 steps and now works to help others.

He also thinks a lot about why he made the decision to live, to fight, and get better, when many others — including some fellow pro hockey players — have gone down a different path.

""In the beginning, it was because I wanted to see my brothers,"" said Clune, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Then it transformed into wanting to live for myself. I started to discover what it feels like to have self esteem and to have love.

""I just hope people realize that they're not alone with how they feel. Don't be afraid to ask for help.""

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

article continues below

""After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,"" Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal's three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first overall by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

""A low-maintenance superstar,"" said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg's senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At five foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn't blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack of getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday. ""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League. I think it was Dale's arrival that really cemented the future of the franchise and I think we all have recollections of that first year, that Calder (Trophy) year and then everything that would follow.

""He was truly a superstar as a hockey player, but I think why he was so loved here was not just that but largely the fact that he made this his home and became one of us. I think everybody shared that sense of pride in Dale's career as a player.""

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: ""All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL's all time greatest players.""

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

""What an incredible human being,"" Selanne tweeted.

Montreal Canadiens associate coach Kirk Muller also had a chance to speak with Hawerchuk in recent days.

""I talked to Dale a few days ago, and we had a good chance to chat. A good friend, had a real good opportunity to play against one of the all-time best players. As a hockey player, we all know how great he was, but he was a good friend and just a really special person, did a lot for charities. It's a real loss for us in the hockey world.""

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk ""one of the most decorated players in our game's history.""

In September 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

""For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I'm ready to fight it,"" he told TSN in October 2019. ""I want to live to tell the story.""

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie's bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames players Andrew Mangiapane and Rasmus Andersson remembered playing for Hawerchuk in Barrie.

""I don't know where I'd be without him,"" said Mangiapane. ""Very sad news today. I owe my career basically to him and the whole Barrie organization.""

Andersson, from Sweden, said ""Dale was a fantastic human being. Such a great person. My first week in Barrie he invited us over to his house and really just welcomed me to Canada. I cannot say enough good things about him as a person. Obviously a real good coach, too.""

""It's awful news.""

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday's opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at age two and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur's record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

""I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive — well maybe a little further now with the traffic,"" he said. ""I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""

""I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,"" he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and '81 with teammates that included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL's top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt like he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year — the youngest recipient at the time — and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

""Just one of the greatest. You could tell from day one. We knew from when he was 18 years old as a player that he would turn the (Jets) franchise around. Certainly one of the best I’ve ever played with and coached,"" said Dallas Stars coach Rick Bowness, who played with and coached Hawerchuk in the '80s.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

""He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,"" said Mike Doran, Winnipeg's director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the faceoff in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux's famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

""It turned out fantastic,"" said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada's call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets ""are etched in my mind every day that I live.""

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes' ring of honour.

Hawerchuk re-wrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia whom he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

""It's like going back down memory lane,"" he said in his induction speech.

""All the experiences have been fantastic,"" he added. ""I mean, sometimes they didn't feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing ... Even though I didn't win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn't change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.""

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets' Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November 2017.

""Tonight we fly Ducky's number high,"" said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue's ""Home Sweet Home,"" before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

""Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,"" said the PA announcer.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

""I've been to every part of (Manitoba), either golfing or playing (softball),"" Hawerchuk said. ""I've gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I'm honoured and I'm very humbled.""

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.

""They should be able to do that if they have an opportunity.""

While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season. However, 66 players have currently opted out of participating in the 2020 campaign, which could create opportunity for some CFL players to sign deals south of the border and have a chance to earn a football paycheque, either on the active roster or on the practice squad.

While there's no shortage of collegiate players available, the advantage a CFL player has is pro experience, a fact not lost upon NFL personnel people.

The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign. This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.

And players on NFL practice rosters receive at least US$8,000 per week.

Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the CFL is amendable to doing what it can to help its players.

""Where we can do something we will,"" he said. ""We're going to be committed to working towards good outcomes, the best possible outcomes we can have with out players.

""That's not going to mean we're going to be able to do everything but we're certainly going to go into this with a real positive spirit.""

Something else that will be on the CFL-CFLPA radar will be the current collective bargaining agreement, which is slated to expire after the 2021 season. But union president Solomon Elimimian said the two sides covered a lot of ground this time around during talks to amend the agreement for a shortened '20 season.

""Whether we deal with '21 when it comes or after the '21 season I think there's hope there that we can work together,"" Elimimian said. ""Obviously the relationship between the players and the league needs to be one where the players feel appreciated.

""Everyone wants to the league to reach its full potential. The partnership has to be one that's very genuine and the players have to feel part of that. If that happens, the sky is the limit.""

Ryu (2-1) struck out three and walked none. The left-hander permitted only one runner past second base and yielded just one extra-base hit to a team that came in ranked second in the majors with a .467 slugging percentage.

Rather than vie for strikeouts, Ryu said he was focused more on getting the Orioles to hit the ball weakly.

""I was able to keep them off balance,"" he said through an interpreter.

Signed in December to an $80 million, four-year contract, Ryu got off to a shaky start with Toronto in July before showing the form he displayed as a star with the Dodgers. He's given up a total of two runs in his last three starts after allowing eight runs over nine innings in his first two outings.

""That was vintage Ryu,"" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. ""Ryu was outstanding. That's the reason we won the game.""

The two home runs were a factor, but mostly Ryu was the difference-maker.

""They didn’t give Ryu that big contract for nothing,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""You just never know what he’s going to throw. You don’t know what side of the plate he’s going to throw to. He’s really tough on right-handers because he can locate it in. You saw a lot of us get jammed.""

The Blue Jays took control with a four-run third against Alex Cobb (1-2). Three infield hits produced a run before Grichuk delivered a three-run drive over the centre-field wall. It was his third home run of the season, all in the last four games.

""Obviously, the pitch to Grichuk was middle middle and it was a poorly executed pitch,"" Cobb said. ""But most of the pitches that I had, I felt like I executed. I got the results.""

Cobb gave up five runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He’s winless in his last four starts.

After hitting 31 homers last year, Grichuk was batting fifth, sixth or seventh in the order this season before Montoyo decided to move him into the No. 2 spot Sunday to replace injured Bo Bichette. Over the past two games, Grichuk has two homers, four hits and six RBIs.

Pedro Severino and Renato Núñez had RBIs for the Orioles, who have dropped two straight after winning seven of eight.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Bichette (right knee sprain) had an MRI and will receive a second opinion on his injury, Montoyo said. Bichette leads Toronto with a .361 batting average.

Orioles: RH Dillon Tate (elbow contusion) came off the injured list and RH Evan Phillips was optioned to the team's alternate site.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: RH Nate Pearson (0-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his fourth start in his first big league season Tuesday night. Drafted 28th overall in 2017, the 23-year-old is looking to rebound after giving up four runs to Miami last week in 2 1/3 innings. ""I'm developing at the highest level,"" Pearson said Monday. ""When I don't have my best stuff, I'm going to struggle.""

Orioles: LH Wade LeBlanc (1-0, 7.13) has allowed a combined 10 runs over 12 innings in his last three starts.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

""We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,"" Marchand said. ""That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.""

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

""We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do — little battles,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.""

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President's Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk's first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy's hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina's captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy putaway from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston's first six post-season games.

""There's other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.""

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen's late goal.

""That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,"" Williams said. ""We got it handed to us.""

NOTES: David Pastrnak had a goal and an assist in Boston’s double-overtime win in Game 1, but hasn’t played since. He had 48 regular-season goals to tie Washington’s Alex Ovechkin for the league lead. … Carolina played without 20-year-old Andrei Svechnikov, who was injured when his leg twisted awkwardly beneath him late in the third period of Saturday's loss. ... DeBrusk scored his 12th and 13th playoff goals since his 2018 post-season debut. … The Hurricanes were also without D Joel Edmundson for the third straight game. … Jake Gardiner assisted on Williams’ first-period goal for his first post-season point with Carolina.

“We have temporarily closed the store to thoroughly clean and sanitize the location. We plan to reopen the store on or before Aug. 17, 2020, in consultation with the Vancouver Island Health Authority.”

The incident is one of the first on Vancouver Island where a business has been closed due to a positive test for an employee. Infection rates are low on Vancouver Island. The website for Island Health, which provides updates on the locations and times of known possible exposures to COVID-19 in the region, did not mention the 7-Eleven case on Saturday afternoon.

“Contact tracing from Island Health’s Public Health team ensures anyone potentially exposed to a confirmed case is followed up with,” a representative from Island health said in a statement.

“When public health officials cannot be certain they have reached all those who need to be contacted and there may be a risk to the public, they issue a public notification. We have no public notifications to issue today.”

A sign on the front door of the 7-Eleven at 1327 Douglas St. said the location was “closed for cleaning,” but made no mention of COVID-19. The sign asked customers to visit nearby 7-Eleven locations for service. By late afternoon, the glass door had been covered entirely with brown paper, cutting off views into the store.

Representatives from delivery services Uber Eats and Skip the Dishes, which are listed as delivery options on the sign, did not respond to requests for comment Saturday. It is unclear if the services had drivers visit the location during the five-day window when the employee had indications of the virus.

7-Eleven Canada said in a statement that staff at the closed Douglas Street location have been asked to self-isolate with pay. The Irving, Texas-based company has 636 stores in Canada.

But if you mean does it reduce the death rate, that is less clear.
But now the death rate.
That is to say, the death rate did not rise as the shutdown was lifted.","Although the COVID-19 epidemic is still unfolding, we’re gradually learning more about the virus and how to combat it. Let’s look at what the numbers tell us.

I’ll start with what we know for almost certain. (“Almost”, because every day brings a new revelation that casts doubt on prior assumptions.)

article continues below

First, those Canadians most vulnerable to serious illness and in some instances death, are elderly. In B.C., the average age of death from COVID-19 is 85. There have been virtually no fatalities among people under 40.

Second, by far the majority of fatalities, countrywide, have occurred in nursing homes. As of May 25, 81 per cent of deaths were recorded in these facilities. Five nursing homes have lost more than 40 per cent of their residents to the virus (all were in Ontario and Quebec.)

After that, things grow progressively less certain. Does shutting down various sectors of the economy and imposing social distancing work?

With near certainty yes, if you mean does it reduce the number of infections. But if you mean does it reduce the death rate, that is less clear.

Let’s start with B.C. and work outward. Initially, when the disease first appeared, the number of infections in our province climbed rapidly from a handful in February, to between 65 and 90 per day between mid-March and late April.

At that point the shutdown took effect, and over the following two months, the daily rate subsided, rarely exceeding 20, and usually fewer. Is that evidence the policy worked?

I believe so, because as soon as the shutdown was eased, the infection rate began to creep back up again, reaching about 40 a day in late July and the mid-80s in August.

This would seem to suggest the hard shutdown did indeed flatten the infection curve. That was important early on, because it was feared a flood of infections would swamp our hospital system.

But now the death rate. From a height of six per day in early April, fatalities declined in a more or less straight line thereafter, with scarcely any recorded in the last days of July and early August (the most recent data I have).

That is to say, the death rate did not rise as the shutdown was lifted. Instead, it fell. The same is true of hospitalizations. (The number of COVID patients currently in hospital, as of Aug. 6, was 13.)

There are several conceivable explanations.

Maybe those most vulnerable to the disease died early in its onset. Certainly that happened in nursing homes.

Or instead, perhaps our modes of treatment have improved. That seems likely.

But there’s a different possibility to consider. Perhaps, all along, death rates were not particularly sensitive to blunt measures such as shutdowns. Maybe, these are not so effective as we thought.

So far, these are B.C. numbers only. Some other jurisdictions, notably the U.S., are seeing different results.

Nevertheless we can bolster this suggestion. A study published in the British medical journal The Lancet on July 21 examined the experience of the top 50 countries ranked by their number of COVID-19 cases.

It found that high numbers of deaths were associated with increased obesity and large disparities in income. This might explain, in part, why fatality rates in the U.S. are higher. That country leads most developed nations in obesity and income inequality.

On the other hand, the study found that rapid border closures and full lockdowns did not affect death rates. At a minimum, that should be food for thought.

Where does all of this leave us? Clearly, nursing homes should remain our immediate centre of attention. Everything possible must be done to make them virus-proof.

And elderly Canadians should be advised to take extra care.

After that, though, the uncertainties mount. If fatalities remain low, but the infection rate rises, even to pre-shutdown levels as it is now doing, are we willing to inflict further economic and social turmoil to deal with this?

At some point, we’re going to have to normalize a disease that might be with us for years. That might mean stratifying the population, with more comprehensive protections for those at serious risk, and less-intrusive measures for those who are not.

And don’t pin your hopes on a vaccine. Canada’s chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, has warned that if one is found, it’s unlikely to represent a silver bullet.

Personally, I would want to see much stronger evidence that large-scale shut-ins will suppress fatalities in jurisdictions such as B.C., before going this way again.

Easily said, of course. As someone who ran B.C.’s health ministry once upon a time, I know how much more complex things look from the inside than they do from outside.

I’m also aware how little room to manoeuvre public health officials such as Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix have in a climate of fear and near panic.

All the more reason to keep the debate focused, as much as possible, on what the data are telling us."

The need has grown in the community as incomes have shrunk or dried up.

Demand at the Food Bank has increased around 32 per cent since March, said Duncan Chalmers, community engagement and grants co-ordinator.

“And our food rescue programming has increased around 66 per cent,” he said. Every day, about 8,000 pounds of fresh, perishable food is collected and redistributed through more than 65 partner organizations within the Food Share Network.

“As COVID restrictions continue and government supports such as the CERB [Canada Emergency Response Benefit] begin to expire, we expect to see a continued or even elevated degree of need as we move into the fall,” Chalmers said.

Pre-COVID, the food bank helped about 6,000 individuals per month, with the larger network assisting 40,000 people each month, he said.

More families, especially single-parent families, are turning to the food bank, he said.

Seniors or those concerned about seniors they know are also contacting the agency in higher numbers, he said.

Although food stocks are stable right now, “as emergency funding continues to diminish we envision an increased need for donations as we move into the fall and the unknown season of what’s next” regarding COVID, he said.

As with all organizations, the pandemic has altered the way the food bank operates.

Instead of people showing up at the 625 Queens Ave. location to view available dry goods and perishables and choose products in a market setting, they now collect pre-packaged hampers, passed over by staff in the parking lot.

People can also pick up fresh produce at that location as well.

Hampers with non-perishable food are packed in the organization’s 13,500-square-foot Esquimalt warehouse.

The number of employed staff members has dropped to about 20 from 30, as some services are not being offered at this time, such as programming in the building, Chalmers said.

Numbers at the food bank have gone down as well. Prior to the pandemic, about 50 volunteers helped out daily, out of a pool of more than 350, Chalmers said.

Now a smaller team of about 15 to 20 people comes in “pretty much every day,” he said. “Good to keep amount of people coming in and out of the Mustard Seed to a minimum and keep our work bubble small.”

The agency accepts both food and financial donations. Financial donations are preferred, as it can stretch each dollar through purchasing agreements with wholesalers, he said.

Among the organizations benefitting from the Food Share Network is Living Edge, which also receives help from other community-oriented agencies.

It partners with local churches to offer free fresh groceries, breads and other items at weekly markets throughout the community. Churches rely on hundreds of volunteers put on the markets.

People are not required to show identification, said Deborah Price, Living Edge administrative assistant.

Markets are held in locations such as Esquimalt, Central Saanich, downtown, Quadra Street. These days everyone is following health and safety protocols, Price said.

The markets do more than provide essentials — they foster friendships as well as a sense of community, she said.

“It is really doing more than just feeding people.” she said. “It is connecting people and giving people hope and know that they are not in this alone.”

Adrian Dix says parties may not be immediately shut down but there would be consequences for those found flaunting the rules. Private parties “have been a significant source of problems,” he said at a news conference Thursday. “I have to say this: If you’re thinking of organizing a party, especially one involving alcohol, where there’s no specific limits on distancing that you’re putting in place, you should not do so.”

He said environmental health and bylaw officers would be out checking banquet halls and other places that hold events to ensure the 50-person capacity limit is being respected.

“They can expect to be visited,” he said of those hosting private events. “The rules will be enforced and that will have consequences in the future … what this is is warning in advance this weekend of what can happen and our expectation, our expectation, that rules will be followed.”

His comments come as B.C. reported 78 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the province’s total to 4,274. No new deaths were reported Thursday, leaving the total at 196.

No new confirmed cases were reported in the Island Health region, which has had a total of 150. Of those, three are active and 142 people have recovered. Five deaths have been linked to the virus.

The region has had six reported cases in the past two weeks, according to numbers from the B.C. Centre for Disease Control: one in the north Island region, which includes part of the mainland, four in the central Island, and one on the south Island.

The north Island has been hardest hit, data show, with 60 confirmed cases between Jan. 1 and Aug. 13. The central Island has had 39 cases and the south Island has had 51.

People between the ages of 20 to 29 now make up the group seeing the largest increase of infections, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said.

Those infections have been seen after exposure events, such as parties where young adults have been gathering, she added.

Henry said those in that age range as well as people between the ages of 30 to 39 make up a disproportionate number of the province’s infections.

But she cautioned against criticizing the behaviour of all people in that age group.

“I think we have to be a little bit careful about demonizing. Most young people are doing the right things and they are socially responsible, and they care a tremendous amount about their communities and their families.” she said.

Henry also revealed some of the responses to the COVID-19 Population Healthy Survey, laying out the toll the pandemic has had on people of different ethnic and racial backgrounds.

About 390,000 British Columbians completed the survey, which asked questions about the financial and societal impact the pandemic had taken on them.

Those who identified as West Asian, Latin American and South Asian respondents were the most likely to report difficulties in meeting financial needs. West Asian, Latin American and Black respondents were the most likely to report job losses caused by the pandemic.

Caucasian respondents reported fewer financial difficulties, but increased alcohol consumption. Those with lower incomes also reported issues with food security as well as trouble meeting their financial needs.

In a human experiment like no other since the pandemic was declared in March,

more than 600,000 students, teachers and staff are expected to resume classes in B.C. as part of the government’s kindergarten to Grade 12 back-to-school plan.

It is not, as Premier John Horgan told reporters Aug. 12, a plan that is without concerns from government, which continues to say restarting in-class instruction is the right thing to do for a child’s social, academic and mental development.

“I’m excited about it,” Horgan said. “Am I apprehensive? Sure, but I think that we can go into this with the best of intentions and have the best outcomes, if we all work together.”

Horgan made those comments the day before Lisa Descary, who teaches math and science at Steveston-London secondary school in Richmond, participated in a small protest outside Health Minister Adrian Dix’s constituency office on Joyce Street in Vancouver.

She was there with other teachers, parents and a student concerned about the plan. Dix, at the time, was in Victoria with Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry releasing more COVID-19 data, announcing 78 new cases.

“It is going against everything that Dr. Bonnie Henry has told us we need to do to flatten the [epidemiological] curve,” said Descary, while holding a sign calling for smaller class sizes. “Instead of less faces in larger spaces, it’s putting more student faces in poorly ventilated, under-funded, crowded indoor spaces, and I’m terrified.”

Stacey Wakelin, who organized the protest with former Vancouver school trustee Carrie Bercic, has a son going into Grade 12 and a daughter about to start Grade 10 at R.E. Mountain secondary in Langley.

Wakelin is a coordinator of the SafeSeptemberBC.com website and Facebook group that have worked as sounding boards for parents around the province concerned about sending their children back to school.

Parents, she said, want changes to the plan, which are being voiced in a letter to Education Minister Rob Fleming. They’re asking for a two-week delay to reopen schools to better understand the guidelines, to make masks mandatory when feasible, to reduce class sizes and offer blended learning options for students.

Wakelin’s husband has contacted the Langley school district about an online option for the couple’s children, or a model similar to the one in June where students returned for a couple of days while the balance of instruction was done online.

“I would really like my kids back in school,” she said. “That’s what I’m hoping to see. My son has gone through his entire school career with a lot of these kids, and I’d like him to be able to finish it.”

The “mixed messaging” from Henry and government is what troubles Wakelin, who emphasized she has had the utmost respect for Henry and Dix until the back-to-school plan was released July 29.

“I can’t go into a store without a mask on, I can’t throw a party with more than 50 people, but we can send our kids back [to school],” she said. “I don’t get it.”

Parent Stacey Wakelin is concerned about sending her two kids back to high school in Langley - Mike Howell



The B.C. government will spend $45.6 million to implement the plan, which includes enhanced cleaning of schools, adding hand-washing stations, providing reusable masks and other safety measures.

In recent weeks, when questions have arisen about the government’s plan, Henry has said she doesn’t “necessarily expect there to be [COVID-19] cases in schools” but that it was “inevitable there probably will be some.”

Current worldwide data on COVID-19 has shown a very low infection rate in people 19 years old and under, and even lower in children under the age of 10, according to government.

Data from Canada’s Public Health Agency shows more than 9,500 people aged 19 or younger out of 119,505 cases reviewed had tested positive for COVID-19 in the country, as of Aug. 17.

That data became available the same day the B.C. government announced that masks will be required for staff, middle and secondary students in high traffic areas such as on buses and in hallways, “or anytime outside of their learning group whenever physical distancing cannot be maintained.”

Masks will not be required in classrooms.

Henry has cautioned masks are “an additional layer on top of the other layers that we use to keep each other safe, and it is the least effective of the many layers that we have.”

Physical distancing and keeping gatherings of people small are more effective measures to prevent transmission of the disease, she said in a July 23 briefing to reporters.

The government’s plan calls for students to be placed in “learning groups” of no more than 60 at elementary and middle schools, and a maximum of 120 at high schools to reduce the number of close, in-person interactions.

It will be up to each of B.C.’s 60 school districts to tailor the plan to meet the ministry’s guidelines. That could prove challenging for districts with large school populations, most of which are in Metro Vancouver.

Sixteen high schools in the province have student populations between 1,500 and 2,000, including Terry Fox secondary in Port Coquitlam.

That’s where Josh Czeto, who lives in Pitt Meadows, is a student and looking to begin his Grade 12 year. Czeto said he doesn’t want to return, saying he would prefer an online option similar to what students transitioned to in March.

Josh Czeto and his mother Florence from Pitt Meadows attended a recent protest outside Health Minister Adrian Dix’s constituency office in Vancouver - Mike Howell



He and his mother Florence attended the rally outside Dix’s office, with Czeto saying his concern about learning in a classroom is shared by friends, who fear a return to school could lead to more transmission of COVID-19.

“One of the bigger worries with my friends is that there are these types of people in schools who don’t care about COVID, who don’t think it’s real,” he said, holding a sign calling for online schooling. “I don’t want to take that chance with the general public, to be honest. I think it’s ridiculous to make people take that chance. Seems like the only people who are not on board with this are the people who have to show up, like the teachers and the students.”

An emailed statement from the Ministry of Education was provided to Glacier Media in place of an interview with Fleming in response to concerns raised by teachers, parents and students.

The statement, which repeated most of what was announced in the back-to-school plan, emphasized that B.C. was the only jurisdiction in Canada that returned students to the classroom in June “and this has given us valuable information that we are using to develop our plans, ensuring health and safety at schools remain paramount.”

Teachers and staff are scheduled to return Sept. 8, before students arrive Sept. 10 and 11 to understand what learning during a pandemic will look like in their schools.

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

article continues below

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

When asked by the Richmond News, a spokesperson for the Provincial Health Services Authority, which oversees the BCCDC, said the agency believes the discrepancy likely occurred because the passengers who contracted the virus aren’t B.C. residents, and that “the province or territory in which these cases reside notified the Public Health Agency of Canada about the exposure, but not the BCCDC.”

“BCCDC staff are connecting with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) to ask that they be notified whenever PHAC becomes aware of an exposure on a flight with an origin or destination in B.C. to prevent this situation from occurring in the future,"" said spokesperson Jane Campbell in an emailed statement.

Typically, said Campbell, flights where exposures may have occurred are identified by the province or territory that’s managing the case during its investigation and contact tracing.

BCCDC adds flights to its public exposures webpage once they are identified as health officials investigate the COVID-19 case, or when the agency is alerted to an exposure on a flight by another province or territory."

This latest extension will end on Sept. 1 and allows the government to manage immediate concerns, such as recent outbreaks in some areas of the province.

Premier John Horgan says B.C. residents have made sacrifices to keep transmission rates down, but now unsafe gatherings are eroding that progress.

The province announced 83 new cases on Tuesday for a total of 4,677 cases since the pandemic began.

No new deaths were reported, leaving the total number of fatalities at 198.

There are 775 active cases in B.C. and 2,326 people under monitoring because they have been exposed to someone who has been infected with COVID-19.

In a statement, Horgan says the government is committed to getting back on track and it will announce new enforcement measures against those who put others at risk.

""The vast majority of British Columbians are following Dr. Henry's orders of seeing fewer faces in bigger spaces, but we all have to remain committed to flattening the curve,"" he said.

The credit reporting agency said in a quarterly report that credit card balances fell 12.3 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period a year ago.

Reduced opportunities for spending during the lockdown may have contributed to the drop, said TransUnion's Matt Fabian, but he also noted that people are dipping into savings or retirement funds rather than relying on credit cards.

""Recent feedback from our survey seems like the folks that say they're still experiencing a lot of financial hardship continues to drop. And there's a lot more certainty in terms of the response, in terms of what they're going to do. Consumers have fortified themselves,"" said Fabian.

TransUnion uses the credit bureaus' national consumer credit database as source material for its quarterly report.

Applications for new credit also grew at a slower-than-usual pace amid reduced access to branches during the lockdown, uncertainty around employment and a pullback on new offers from lenders.

The report did note that credit balances for Millennials and Gen Z consumers grew 0.8 per cent and 5.9 per cent, respectively, as those consumers have less buffer in the form of savings, investments or retirement funds. Overall instalment loan debt also rose by 3.9 per cent in the second quarter to $175.4 billion, up from $168.8 billion a year ago.

Mortgage debt is on the rise, TransUnion said, with new mortgages, renewals and refinances up 29 per cent from a year ago and a 5.3 per cent annual increase in the total volume of mortgage debt.

""The spring, that's usually the big mortgage season or the big home buying season. With people not being able to go out, and constraints around travelling and visiting homes and looking at new homes, once some of those lock downs were lifted, we've seen sort of a real surge,"" Fabian said.

""Certainly for some consumers that have existing mortgages, deferrals were an option, and a lot of consumers opted to take it … certainly for a lot of people, a mortgage might be one of the biggest monthly or biweekly expenses that they'd have.""

Despite a 4.3 per cent rise in total outstanding debt in Canada, which stood at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter, Fabian says delinquencies have risen less than expected, as about 2.6 million Canadians, or 9.2 per cent of credit consumers, have at least one active deferral.

Delinquencies also were on the rise for personal loans, which TransUnion noted are ""partly fuelled by alternative lenders who have been slightly more aggressive in issuing personal loans to below prime consumers.""

""We have seen delinquency rates go up a little bit, but a lot less than we had expected… and I think part of that is the deferral and forbearance processes that are in place with the lenders as well as the support from the government,"" said Fabian.

""Delinquency tends to be a long-tail thing where it takes a while. People have exhaust all their options before they will start to continuously skip and miss payments. As deferrals come off and the government subsidization ends, we expect to see some delinquency spike.""

“We cannot let a few wreck it for everybody else, and that is the reason why action is being taken,” said Dix, speaking from Vancouver Monday afternoon during the latest COVID-19 update.

While he didn’t provide details, Dix said the government will be “taking further steps to impose stricter penalties,” and the plan will “optimize” the use of enforcement officers outside of public health, for example, municipalities, police departments and WorkSafe BC.

Dix said the plan will come into effect later this week, once it’s announced by B.C. Solicitor General Mike Farnworth.

B.C. recorded 236 new COVID-19 cases between Friday and Monday, including 100 cases on Saturday – the largest single-day jump so far. There are now 743 active cases in the province.

Since late June, the majority of new cases have been driven by young people in their 20s and 30s.

A string of public exposure alerts has been issued recently for restaurants, bars, night clubs and stores across the Lower Mainland.

And over the weekend, videos emerged of large gatherings – with little social distancing – including drum circles and a late-night street party in Vancouver.

However, Dix said that the “greatest danger” remains private, indoor parties.

“We are continuing to review what can be done about those, and continuing to engage with people and discourage people from hosting such gatherings,” he said.

Dix said that while 50 is the maximum number of people permitted at a gathering in B.C., however, depending on the event and the location, the number of guests that is safe could be “considerably” lower."

""Find out more about what your school district is doing, and then adjust according to that.","TORONTO — Vonny Sweetland has yet to decide if he will be sending his 12-year-old sister Josephine back to class in September, but just in case he does, he's been stocking up on supplies for months.

He picks up hand sanitizer when he sees it in stores, grabbed new masks last month, bought a fresh uniform and has been testing out Josephine's muscle power with some new lunch containers.

The new additions to her backpack and are all part of a wave of changes families — and their wallets — are being confronted with as they prepare for back to school, whether it's sourcing protective equipment or choosing a thermos their child can open unassisted.

""In a COVID-era, all of these things we take for granted or think are minuscule are actually really important,"" said Sweetland, who is his sister's guardian.

""These are things as simple as a teacher helping you unpack your lunch or zipping a zipper. To prevent potential spread, I don't think teachers are really going to be doing these things.""

The cost of so many new supplies can easily add up.

A Deloitte survey of 1,200 parents who have at least one child attending school in grades K-12 this fall found the average family will spend $102 on school supplies, $216 on clothing and accessories, $395 on computers and hardware, $316 on electronic gadgets and digital subscriptions.

The survey, which was conducted between May and July, found those families will allocate $61 on a new category: home or health supplies.

Even so, back-to-school shopping doesn't have to be more expensive than any other year, said Seung Hwan (Mark) Lee, an associate professor of retail management at Ryerson University.

He recommends shoppers compare prices and take advantage of sales.

Anne Marie Taber said she's noticed plenty of sales, though she hasn't sought them out when shopping with seven-year-old daughter Avery because she tries to minimize her time in stores and instead use online options with delivery to lessen her exposure to the virus.

She stocked up as soon as she could on Old Navy's uniform-style clothing because several sizes were out of stock and also grabbed Avery a new backpack.

On top of masks and hand sanitizers, they bought a wide-mouth water bottle without a straw to make cleaning easy, plastic Duo-Tangs that can be wiped down and a set of art supplies that Avery has been reminded not to share.

""This is extra stuff we haven't had to buy in the past but it's a small dollar to pay to make sure that that is just hers exclusively,"" Taber said.

Parents may also want to consider disposable cutlery, if they have children that bring lunches to school and are worried about germs spreading through anything reuseable, Lee said.

If your child is doing virtual classes, he suggests ensuring you have a reliable laptop or tablet with a webcam.

Those who want to go all out or are older and have specific needs for programs they are enrolled in, may need to think about microphones and speakers too.

Those supplies don't come cheap. However, the cost of those high-ticket items could be partially offset by a change he sees happening across universities and colleges during the pandemic.

""It's no longer really about carrying around the heavy textbooks,"" he said.

""Many professors aren't holding lengthy exams because the exams are becoming very difficult to monitor and you can't really get a proctor to look at how students are conducting their exams... so using test banks or textbooks no longer apply.""

If you're feeling anxious or stressed about back to school shopping and advertisements are making you feel you better get to a store soon, Lee says not worry.

""I would advise parents right now not to rush into getting supplies,"" he said.

""Find out more about what your school district is doing, and then adjust according to that. A deal can always be had.""

That worst-case scenario was on the minds of some federal politicians as they watched New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs pull the plug Monday on his minority Conservative government, becoming the first jurisdiction in Canada to send voters to the polls in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

New Brunswick's example will doubtless offer some lessons on how to conduct an election safely.

It may also embolden other federal opposition parties to join the Bloc Quebecois in its determination to bring down Justin Trudeau's government at the first opportunity. That opportunity will arise sooner than expected with the prime minister's announcement Tuesday that Parliament is being prorogued and will return Sept. 23 with a throne speech. A vote on the speech will be a test of confidence in the government.

For that matter, Higgs' example may embolden Trudeau to pull the plug himself.

And it has NDP democratic reform critic Daniel Blaikie appealing to his counterparts in other federal parties to begin discussing now how best to safely conduct a federal election during the pandemic rather than sleepwalk into potential chaos.

""The worst thing would be to get to the point where we're saying, 'OK, we're having an election' and then having these disputes about the process and having somebody within the political system decide that it's in their best interests to start assailing the legitimacy of the process that's already under way,"" he said in an interview.

Without some all-party consensus on how to conduct an election safely, Blaikie fears Canada could wind up in a situation similar to the United States, where Donald Trump is making unsubstantiated assertions that mail-in ballots will result in rampant voter fraud during November's presidential election.

""We don't need a political crisis on top of a public health and economic crisis,"" he said.

As part of its preparations for a possible election during the pandemic, Elections Canada has set up an internal working group to assess the agency's ability to conduct the vote safely — including its capacity to handle mail-in ballots, find alternative polling station locations and keep both voters and poll workers safe.

But there's only so much Elections Canada can do under current law. In a post on its website about the impact of the pandemic on election planning, the agency notes for instance that Parliament would have to change the Canada Elections Act to allow for an election to be conducted entirely by mail-in ballots.

And it adds this warning: ""In an extreme case, based on the advice of public health experts, the chief electoral officer could certify that it has become impracticable for Elections Canada to administer the election in one or more electoral districts and recommend to the governor-in-council (the governor general on the advice of cabinet) that the election writ be withdrawn.

""This has never been done in Elections Canada's history.""

It's that warning that particularly worries Blaikie. His nightmare scenario is that the government is defeated or Trudeau chooses to call an election, the governor general duly dissolves Parliament ""and then Elections Canada says, 'We're actually not sure we can do this.'""

""So then you have a dissolved Parliament, you have an executive with no Parliament to hold it to account and how long does that go on? ... If that is a possibility, I think it's one we should all be very concerned about.""

Back on June 25, Blaikie wrote his counterparts in the other federal parties asking that they work together to find a way to ensure an election can be conducted safely during the pandemic with a process that is ""politically legitimate.""

No one has so far responded to his letter.

""I find it kind of shocking that we've got people out there talking really strongly about wanting an election and the conditions under which they would precipitate an election when we don't actually know how to have an election properly right now.""

Higgs predicted Monday that New Brunswick will have little difficulty pulling off a safe election, albeit one in which candidates don't go door-to-door or hand out pamphlets.

With fewer than 200 cases of COVID-19 and just two deaths since March, New Brunswick has been relatively unscathed by the virus, which has infected more than 122,000 and killed more than 9,000 countrywide. Moreover, the pandemic is in something of a lull at the moment - which may no longer be the case later in the fall when the Trudeau government's fate could be on the line.

The province's chief electoral officer, Kim Poffenroth, said her agency has instituted a number of measures to ensure voters' and electoral workers' safety. Among them: marking the floors at polling stations to keep voters at least two-meters apart, requiring the use of hand sanitizer when voters enter and exit polling stations, providing disposable masks to electors, requiring workers to wear masks or face shields and hiring additional workers to manage the flow of voters and to clean high-touch surfaces.

As well, she said Elections New Brunswick has cancelled polling stations in long-term care and seniors' homes and will make it easier for residents in those facilities to vote by mail. It has also stocked up on mail-in ballots.

However, should a second surge of COVID-19 cases erupt before Sept. 14, Poffenroth conceded it could impact voter turnout.

""We may have even greater challenges finding workers to work at the polls and then we may run into problems with the owners of buildings where we're supposed to have polling locations not wanting us to use those locations.""

But regardless of how difficult it might become to administer the election, Poffenroth has no legal authority to recommend that it be called off - unlike Canada's chief electoral officer, Stephane Perrault.

""There's really no playbook for how to do this,"" she said. ""It's a learning curve for both ourselves and other election management bodies across the country and we just happen to be the first ones out the gate.""

The recently retired Winnipeg Blue Bombers superfan was hoping to fill up his summer schedule with football games.

""All hell broke loose,"" he said Tuesday.

He was disappointed to learn his team won't be able to defend its Grey Cup championship this year. However, he's not letting the CFL's decision to scrap the season affect his unbroken streak — he is considering 2020 a lost year.

""It's not my fault they aren't playing this year, so I'm going to consider my streak alive,"" he said. ""If it was happening this year in Regina, I would be going.""

Fans across the league shared in the sadness of the lost year after commissioner Randy Ambrosie announced the decision to cancel the 2020 season and focus on 2021.

There was hope Winnipeg — home of the 2019 champions — could serve as a hub city for the league. But the CFL was unable to secure financing from the federal government or resolve some other issues.

It marks the first year the Grey Cup won't be presented since 1919.

Fan Mike Goodchild had a lot more time for vacation and house projects this summer in Manitoba, but said he'd rather be watching football games.

""We miss going to the games, watching our favourite players,"" Goodchild said Tuesday. ""It is what it is right now.""

That the Bombers remain the reigning champions is a small silver lining to the news, Emile Morrissette said. The Manitoba team won its 11th CFL championship with a 33-12 victory against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats last November, ending a 29-year drought.

Morrissette, a season ticket holder, wanted to see what the champions would have done to defend the title on the field.

""Finally we win the Grey Cup and we have a very competitive team and we are probably going into the season to be one of the favourites again and then that COVID hit,"" Morrissette said.

""You know, it just makes it tough as a fan.""

Some people plan their summers around the cottage or the beach, but Morrissette and his sister make their plans around going to football games together.

He supports the decision if the league can become stronger and more financially stable for future seasons.

In Saskatchewan, Nelson Hackewich said he was expecting the season would be cancelled, but it was still hard to hear.

""The league was in a situation where it couldn't win. It was going to lose money either way,"" he said. ""It still hurts that we aren't going to have CFL football this year.""

To say the Hackewich family are Saskatchewan Roughriders fans is an understatement — they bleed green and white, he said. They are known for the Rider Room in his parents' Regina house. They converted Hackewich's childhood bedroom into a place to showcase decades of Roughriders memorabilia.

To fill the hole left by the season, Hackewich began simulating the CFL season using a video game and livestreaming it online. Each Friday, he gets about 8,000 viewers. But it's not quite the same as watching the game, he said.

It also feels like a bit of salt in the wound for Hackewich that the season was cancelled the year the Roughriders' top rivals — the Bombers — hold the Cup.

""They ended one of the longest droughts in CFL history and the league decided they were going to shut it down... It's all Winnipeg's fault,"" Hackewich said with a friendly laugh.

Morrissette responded from Winnipeg that it better not be another curse on the Bombers.

""They won the Cup and then the season gets cancelled, right? It's kind of weird,"" he said. ""But technically I can never agree with a Rider fan. That's just in the DNA.""

The prime minister shared his uncertainty during a news conference on Parliament Hill on Tuesday, only weeks before classes in Ontario and much of the rest of the country are set to resume after being suspended in the spring due to the pandemic.

""Like so many parents, that's something we are in very active discussions on,"" Trudeau said outside the House of Commons, where he announced that Parliament was being prorogued after a small cabinet shuffle.

""We are looking at what the schools' plans are, we're looking at class sizes, we're looking at how the kids are feeling about wearing masks. All my friends as parents are asking these same questions.""

A new survey by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies suggested the majority of parents plan to send their kids to school, but that most would want classes cancelled if there is a new COVID-19 outbreak in their community.

Those results suggested many parents are torn, with 66 per cent of respondents with children saying they were worried about children returning to school but 63 per cent saying they planned to send their kids anyway.

Yet 69 per cent also felt all classes should be suspended and learning shifted back to home if there is a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in their community, with 19 per cent saying classes should continue and 12 per cent unsure either way.

The online survey of 1,510 Canadians over age 18, including 385 parents with school-aged children in their households, took place Aug. 14-16. An internet poll cannot be given a margin of error because it is not a random sample.

The results underscore the nervousness and sensitivities around the planned reopening of school, says Leger president Jean-Marc Leger, with many parents supporting the return of classes but ready to shut it down again at the drop of a hat.

""People are nervous,"" he said. ""It's a very sensitive question.""

For his part, Trudeau said the federal government is making infrastructure money available for provinces to help retrofit schools and other public buildings to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. But he also acknowledged the concern many parents are feeling.

""I know that lots of parents are going to be watching carefully what their local school boards' plans are,"" he said. ""There is a lot of reflection in a lot of households, including mine, as to what's going to happen when September rolls around.""

The Leger survey also found strong support among respondents with children for requiring certain protections to be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at schools, including 76 per cent who said students should have to wear masks.

The result was not broken down by whether masks should be required for only high school students or students in both high school and elementary. Some provinces such as Ontario are requiring masks for students in certain grades but not others.

Eighty-four per cent of respondents with kids said teachers and school staff should be required to wear masks while 75 per cent supported temperature checks for children and 71 per cent wanted screening questionnaires.

""People are saying: 'OK, we agree. We support the government's initiative. But at the same time, you should ensure that the rules are respected at school,'"" said Leger.

Parents were more divided over what to do if a student or teacher in their kid's class tested positive for COVID-19.

While 24 per cent reported they would keep their kids home from school indefinitely, 35 per cent said they would keep them home for at least 14 days while 33 per cent indicated they would follow the advice of their school on next steps.

The provincial announcement on Monday clarified that, in addition to having to wear a mask, students will be required to physical distance from anyone who is not in their “learning group.”

Schools are set to open up full-time in the fall, but students will be limited to contact within their “learning groups” – groups of 60 students in elementary schools and 120 in high schools.

Hospitalizations decreased from 12 cases to four.

Deputy provincial health officer Dr. Reka Gustafson said most of those testing positive are young, which suggests the province has done a relatively good job of protecting the most vulnerable.

However, she said young people are more likely to have mild infections and may not realize they have COVID-19 before they spread it to others, adding that severe infections can occur at any age.

Anyone with even a slight symptom should stay home from work and gatherings, and anyone who has been advised that they've been in contact with a case should isolate for 14 days, even if no symptoms develop, she said.

""You could easily spread the virus to someone who is vulnerable.""

The new infections bring the total active cases to 743. There have been 4,594 confirmed cases since the pandemic began.

Two more people have died from the virus for a total of 198 deaths.

While there are no new community outbreaks, the health authority in northern B.C. issued an alert after confirming 17 cases linked to a religious gathering held between July 30 and Aug. 2.

Anyone who attended the It Is Time event in Deadwood, Alta., is asked to monitor themselves, self-isolate and seek testing if any COVID-19 symptoms develop.

""This pandemic is not ending soon, this pandemic that we're all tired of,"" Dix said.

Officials now expect it to continue ""well through 2021 into 2022,"" he added.

""This new normal is going to be in place for a long time and the way that we address that, the way that we deal with that as a society, inevitably, has to be by choice and by engagement.""

Solicitor General Mike Farnworth will announce stricter penalties later this week for those who break public health rules designed to reduce transmission of the novel coronavirus, said Dix.

Officials are most concerned about private parties and Dix urged people to act responsibly.

""The places where there's the greatest danger are private parties where alcohol is involved and it's inside,"" he said.

Dix said surveillance and enforcement also have a role. Several bars, clubs and restaurants have closed both voluntarily and involuntarily following exposures to the virus.

The CFL cancelled its season Monday due to the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning the Grey Cup won't be presented for the first time since 1919.

The decision comes after the CFL was unable to secure financial assistance from the federal government. The league sent Ottawa an amended request Aug. 3 for a $30-million, interest-free loan, but the sides couldn't come to terms on a deal.

It was the CFL's last-ditch effort to stage an abbreviated season in the hub city of Winnipeg. It came after the league asked for $44 million in July.

""I do feel I am responsible for the fact that we are not on the field this year,"" Ambrosie said in a telephone interview. ""But I resolve to learn from what we've experienced and I'm looking forward to a bright future.

""I think we're all watching an example on the world stage today of a leader that takes no responsibility for anything . . . and no matter what happens, I won't be that guy.""

The CFL had maintained it required government funding to stage a shortened season. In late April, Ambrosie told The Canadian Press the league had presented a three-tiered request for financial assistance that began with $30 million initially, more in the event of a shortened season and up to $150 million in the event of a cancelled campaign.

""I regret that . . . I do wish we hadn't thrown that number ($150 million) out,"" Ambrosie said. ""We never asked for $150 million, at least I don't feel we did.

""What we did was aggregate what we thought was the worst-case scenario . . . and we said, 'In the end our problem could be as big as $150 million,' but that became the number.""

Ambrosie had stated the CFL collectively lost around $20 million last season. With no football in 2020, a source familiar with the situation said the league will lose between $60 and $80 million this year.

Ambrosie said he was at a loss to explain why the CFL and government couldn't come to a suitable financial arrangement. But two league sources said the $30-million request fell through when the assistance couldn't be provided to the league under the terms it sought.

The sources were granted anonymity because the league and government haven't discussed certain financial figures publicly.

Last month, the CFL ruled out a loan from the Business Development Bank of Canada because it felt the interest rate was too high.

""I think there were at least a couple of times when for really good reasons we felt like we were on track to be able to do something with the government,"" Ambrosie said. ""And it didn't happen.

""I feel a sense of disappointment but not anger, just sorrow that something that I thought would come together didn't happen.""

Another requirement for an abbreviated season was the CFL and CFL Players' Association agreeing on an amended collective bargaining agreement. The CFL said it was close to a deal when it called off the season Monday.

That's what made the CFL's decision Monday so surprising to CFLPA president Solomon Elimimian.

""It's definitely disappointing and yes, we were surprised,"" said Elimimian, a Saskatchewan Roughriders linebacker. ""We felt like we were making tremendous progress . . . things were moving in a way that led me to optimism, led all of us to optimism.

""From that aspect, when the news came it was definitely tough.""

Six of the CFL's nine teams are privately owned by either wealthy individuals or organizations. However, none stepped up to provide the funds necessary for a shortened season.

""They have complicated businesses outside of their CFL ownership and all of those things have been affected as well (by the pandemic),"" Ambrosie said. ""I don't think it would be fair to harshly judge them when frankly they give and they give and they give.""

Ambrosie said while he's bitterly disappointed, the CFL and its teams have the luxury of time to plan for the 2021 season. However, there's plenty of uncertainty about next season, most notably if CFL fans will be allowed back in the stands.

The CFL is a gate-driven league and its teams depend heavily upon ticket sales to generate revenue. Ambrosie admits he's concerned about what impact the novel coronavirus will have on his league next season.

""Sure I am concerned but I think this is the challenge we're all facing together,"" he said. ""None of us really know what 2021 is going to look like.

""The optimist in me believes the scientific world is going to create a vaccine and we're going to get back to a more normal world. We'll (prepare) for the best, plan for the worst but I believe that good things will happen. You have to wake up with optimism and frankly that's how I'm going to face the challenge.""

Minister of Canadian Heritage Steven Guilbeault said the government tried to work with the CFL.

""Our government helped the CFL navigate through the existing COVID-19 emergency response programs that are helping tens of thousands of businesses across Canada with revenue and liquidity challenges during this time,"" Guilbeault said in a statement.

""Although the league was able to benefit from some of these programs, its board members ultimately made the decision not to pursue the upcoming season.""

Liberal MP Peter Fragiskatos (London North Centre) supported no federal money going to the CFL.

""The federal government made the right decision here,"" he tweeted. ""While the CFL is a very important part of sport heritage, it is not entitled to special treatment.

""Some fans will be disappointed but the league's ask simply wasn't fair or reasonable.""

With the cancellation, the CFL becomes one of the few major North American pro sports leagues to wipe out play in 2020. Major League Baseball is running a shortened season, while the NHL, NBA and Major League Soccer have resumed play. The NFL says it's planning to start its season on time next month.

Ambrosie has received heavy criticism for his leadership in navigating the CFL through the pandemic. Players routinely took to social media to voice their displeasure with Ambrosie throughout the process and politicians from all major parties criticized the league for not having its players involved in its initial financial assistance request.

However, Ambrosie wants to remain in his post.

""It's been hard and it wouldn't be honest to say that every day since this all started has been a bowl of cherries because it hasn't,"" Ambrosie said. ""I'm committed to this league, I'm committed to its future.

""I'm going to lean in as hard or harder than anything I've done in my career because I think we've got something special and I'd like to be part of it.""

For months, there were fewer than 1,000 people in isolation at any one time. In the space of a week, that number more than doubled.

About three-quarters of these people are in isolation because someone in their family or social or work circles exposed them to the virus. That means there is a growing number of people off work and/or cut off from friends and their community – often through no fault of their own.

Last week’s column was about how our pandemic’s demographics had shifted and that younger people were now picking up the virus in greater numbers than older people.

The sudden explosion in the number of people in isolation is also likely the result of younger people who have the virus exposing more people to it than an older segment of the population because they are generally more socially active and have more personal contacts.

Just when it appeared that B.C. had successfully “bent the curve” when it came to containing the spread of COVID-19, the statistics during the past two weeks have been discouraging.

After averaging about 10 cases a day about a month ago, the daily average as of this column’s writing has been more than 80. And those in isolation continue to climb in number.

However, in a glass-half-full sort of way, three other key statistics continue to offer hope. Thankfully, we have not seen a spike in hospitalizations, critical care cases or deaths.

Since the pandemic was declared, we have had fewer than 600 people in hospital so far. And fewer than 200 people were placed in the ICU.

At our worst point, there were 149 people in the hospital and 72 of them were in the ICU. We have come a long way from those grim days, but we can easily go backwards if we do not do more when it comes to following public health rules and guidelines.

Stop the partying everyone. We do not need more and more people put into isolation, cut off from their everyday world.

The “modelling” of B.C.’s COVID-19 situation that was presented by Dr. Bonnie Henry last week included some of the results of that huge survey of the plight of individuals and families in this pandemic and they were eye opening.

Almost 400,000 British Columbians participated in it. the results showed people with lower incomes and those in some ethnic communities have had the worst experiences when it came to job loss, food scarcity and stress on their children.

Will that situation change in the months ahead? It seems unlikely, since our most vulnerable always seem to pay a heavier price in times of trouble.

The country’s collective reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic may have something to do with these numbers, as our medical services have been tested like never before.

The fact that Canadians are proud of the health-care system does not mean that we do not see opportunities for improvement. This month, we asked Canadians about their overall impressions and saw some numbers tending in a positive direction.

article continues below

In January 2019, one in four Canadians (25%) thought Canada’s health-care system worked well and called for minor changes to make it work better. This month, three in 10 Canadians (30%) share this feeling. In British Columbia, the number of residents who agreed with this point of view increased from 30% in 2019 to 35% now.

There is a sizable gender gap when it comes to having near total satisfaction with the health-care system. While 36% of men in Canada feel this way, the proportion falls to 24% among women.

As was the case last year, the bulk of responses (55%) point to Canada’s health-care system having some good things but requiring many changes. Only 9% of Canadians articulate the notion that the health-care system has so much wrong with it that we need to completely rebuild it – including 20% in Atlantic Canada.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a greater appreciation of health-care workers, and Canada has been immune to the equipment shortages that are plaguing other nations. Across the country, three in four Canadians (76%) expressed confidence that the health-care system would be there to provide help and assistance if they had to face an unexpected medical condition. While this represents a three-point drop since January 2019, maintaining this level of assurance in the middle of a pandemic is eye-catching.

There is some fluctuation when Canadians ponder the biggest problems facing the health-care system. Just under a third (31%, down two points since January 2019) point the finger at long wait times. A shortage of doctors and nurses is second on the list with 26%, up eight points and outlining the desperation of Canadians who have endured the retirement or relocation of their family physician.

There is a silver lining on the issue of bureaucracy and poor management, which dropped from 24% last year to 13% in 2020. Fewer Canadians express concerns over inadequate resources and facilities (8%), a lack of focus on preventive care (6%), a lack of a wider range of services for patients (also 6%) and insufficient standards of hygiene (3%).

Not all Canadian provinces react the same when it comes to the challenges the health-care system faces. Quebecers and Ontarians are more likely to cringe at long wait times. British Columbians are torn between delays in delivery and finding a doctor. Alberta has the highest proportion of residents (20%) who blame bureaucracy and poor management, although that is down significantly from what we found in 2019 (33%).

A crisis is palpable in Atlantic Canada, where a shocking 46% of residents say a shortage of doctors and nurses is the main problem. This might explain why one in five residents of these provinces want to completely rebuild the health-care system.

At a time when our focus is starting to shift about how to pay for the assistance that the federal government has authorized for Canadians struggling because of the pandemic, there is little appetite for a reduction in medical expenditures. Three in four Canadians (75%) reject the federal government making cuts to health-care funding to reduce government debt.

We also continue to see few Canadians believing that medical services would be superior under a different framework. Across the country, just 30% of Canadians think health care in Canada would be better than it is now if it were run by the private sector.

Canadians aged 55 and over are less likely to endorse a move towards privatization (22%) than those aged 35 to 54 (29%) and those aged 18 to 34 (37%). The flirtation with a private system is also bigger in Eastern Canada (39% in Quebec, 30% in Ontario and 29% in the Atlantic provinces) than in Western Canada (24% in British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan and 23% in Alberta).

While some countries around the world have seen their health-care systems exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the way Canadians feel about medical services in the country did not go through an overwhelming shift. The desperation from Canadians who are awaiting a meeting with a specialist remains, but fewer than one third believe our health-care delivery should echo what most Americans have. •

BRITISH COLUMBIA

British Columbia has laid out its plan for studies to resume in ""learning groups"" this fall. School districts are to post final back-to-school details online by Aug. 26.

Back to class: Schools were initially scheduled to welcome students back full time on Sept. 8, but the province announced it is pushing back the restart date by two days to Sept. 10.

Groups: Students will be sorted into learning groups to reduce the number of people they come in contact with. For elementary and middle school students, groups will be no larger than 60 people. Secondary school groups will be capped at 120.

Physical distancing: Students and staff don't need to maintain physical distancing within their learning group, but contact should be minimized. Outside the group, physical distancing is required. Students should be more spaced out in classrooms.

Masks: Staff and students at middle and secondary schools will be required to wear masks on buses and in common areas. The provincial government says masks will also be required whenever students and teachers are outside their learning group and cannot maintain an appropriate physical distance. Students who can't wear masks for medical reasons will be exempt.

New routines: The province is urging schools to stagger recess, lunch and class transition times and take students outside whenever possible.

Transportation: Middle and high school students are asked to wear masks on buses. Students should be assigned seats, and a transparent barrier may be used to separate the driver.

---

ALBERTA

The province is planning to fully reopen schools from kindergarten to Grade 12 this fall. Measures will be tightened if an outbreak occurs and class sizes could be reduced to 20.

Back to class: School will be back in session with extra safety measures, but the province says there are programs to support remote and alternative learning.

Groups: Schools should sort students into cohorts by class when possible to minimize contact with others.

Physical distancing: Physical distancing is recommended when possible. Rooms should be rearranged to increase space between desks.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for staff and many students in some school settings. Students in Grades 4 to 12 must wear masks in all common areas, such as hallways and on buses. Staff are required to wear masks whenever physical distancing cannot be maintained. Mask use will be optional for kids in kindergarten through Grade 3. The government says all students and staff will receive two reusable masks as part of the policy.

Transportation: Parents are asked to bring their children to school if they can. Students who take the bus will sit in the same seat every day.

New routines: Schools are advised to consider a ""no sharing policy,"" with each student bringing their own supplies. Class, lunch and recess schedules will be staggered.

SASKATCHEWAN

Saskatchewan first unveiled a set of back-to-school guidelines in June, but released more details and made some changes in August.

Back to class: Students will return to class on Sept. 8 after the province pushed the date back from as early as Sept. 1

Groups: Groups of students and staff members assigned to them should stick together throughout the day and try not to mingle with other groups. Schools should aim to minimize the number of different instructors who interact with students throughout the day.

Physical distancing: Officials say maintaining physical distance is ""less practical"" for younger children, and the focus should be on limiting physical contact. Officials suggest limiting hugs and hand holding and suggest using alternative greetings such as air high fives. Schools are also to have dedicated quarantine areas where symptomatic students can go before they are picked up by parents.

Masks: The province says it's up to school boards to decide whether to make masks mandatory for students and staff. The chief medical health officer advises Grade 4 to 12 students should wear them in busy areas such as hallways and on buses.

Transportation: Parents should take their kids to school when possible, and pickup and drop-offs should happen outside. Students using school transportation should be assigned seats, and a partition may be used to separate the driver.

New routines: Start times, recess, lunch and class transitions may be staggered to allow for more space for physical distancing. Schools should rearrange their classrooms to space out students. Students and staff are asked to bring hand sanitizer. In school public health visits for routine vaccinations will include COVID-19 testing, with parental consent.

MANITOBA

The Manitoba government says students are going back to the classroom on Sept. 8 with new guidelines.

Back to class: All students from kindergarten to Grade 8 are to have in-class instruction five days a week. High school students will also be in class full time, however, there may be some days of remote learning.

Groups: When physical distancing isn't possible, students will have to be organized into cohorts of no more than 75, and minimize contact with others. In these cases, there must be at least one metre between their desks.

Physical distancing: The province says students are required to maintain a two-metre distance to ""the greatest extent possible."" When it isn't possible, physical barriers may be an option. Spaces should be arranged to encourage separation.

Masks: Masks are strongly recommended for students in Grades 5 to 12. They are required when taking the bus.

Transportation: Masks are required for students Grade 5 and up, as well as drivers, on buses. Parents are encouraged to transport their children to school if they can.

New routines: Lunch and recess are to be staggered to minimize congestion, and in many cases teachers will change classrooms instead of students.

ONTARIO

Ontario students will be back in class September, but their schedules and class sizes may vary depending on where they live.

Back to class: Elementary students and many high schoolers will be in school five days a week in standard class sizes. However, secondary students at two dozen boards that are higher risk will only attend class half the time, and will spend the rest of the week working on ""curriculum-linked independent work."" Parents will also have the option to keep their kids out of class, and boards must provide options for remote learning.

Groups: For high schoolers in high-risk districts, class sizes will be capped at 15. Meanwhile, elementary students won't be broken up into smaller groups, but will be grouped into cohorts and their exposure to different teachers will be limited.

Physical distancing: While Education Minister Stephen Lecce said the aim is to keep students one metre apart from each other, a guidance document says only that schools should promote ""as much distancing as possible"" rather than being strictly enforced.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 through 12, and will be strongly encouraged for younger kids when they're in indoor common areas. Staff will be expected to wear masks.

Transportation: Some school boards may have more than one student assigned to a seat. When physical distancing isn't possible, masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 to 12, and younger students will be encouraged but not required to do the same.

New routines: Students in some districts will have to pre-register for in-person schooling. Some schools may limit or even ban visitors, including parents. Breaks will be scheduled to allow students to wash their hands.

All elementary and high school students in Quebec will be required to attend class in September unless they have a doctor's note indicating they're at high risk of COVID-19 complications or they live with someone at risk. Those students will be allowed to study remotely.

Back to class: Class attendance is mandatory for elementary and high school students. For Grades 10 and 11, schools have the option of alternating schedules where students attend one day out of every two — as long as schools cannot maintain stable classroom bubbles. Grade 10 and 11 students are encouraged to attend classes as much as possible.

Groups: Each classroom will be its own bubble and students will not be required to maintain a two-metre distance between classmates.

Physical distancing: Students will need to keep a two-metre distance from all school staff, as well as all other students outside their classroom bubble. There are no physical distancing requirements for children or teachers in pre-school.

Masks: All students in Grade 5 and up — as well as all school staff — must wear a mask inside all common areas of the school except the classroom. Masks can also be removed when students are eating.

Transportation: No more than 48 students will be allowed on a school bus, with no more than two students sitting on the same bench. Preschool and elementary school students are strongly encouraged to wear masks, while older students are required to wear them.

New routines: When schools return in the fall, teachers will move from classroom to classroom, but students will stay put.

Backup plans: In the event of an outbreak in one class, the entire classroom bubble will be sent home to continue studies remotely. Authorities are also putting together an emergency protocol in the event of a second wave to ensure instruction continues online if entire schools are again forced to close. Ideas include quickly distributing tablets or laptops to students needing them and establishing a digital platform to continue courses and maintain communication.

NEW BRUNSWICK

The province has outlined a set of requirements schools must follow in developing their plans for the fall.

Back to class: Students in kindergarten to Grade 8 are to attend school full time, while those in Grades 9 to 12 are to be taught using a combination of in-class and remote instruction. At-home course work can include online learning, guided projects and experiential education.

Groups: For kindergarten through Grade 2, group sizes will be reduced to about 15, wherever possible. Group sizes should also be shrunk for Grades 3 to 5. Grades 6 to 8 will resume at regular class sizes. Students in Grades 9 to 12 will not be grouped because of their schedules and course options.

Physical distance: Grade 9 to 12 classrooms are required to maintain a one-metre distance, while a two-metre distance is recommended in common areas at all grade levels.

Masks: All students will be required to bring a mask to school, but masks will not be mandatory inside the classroom. Students in Grade 6-12 must wear masks on the school bus and in common areas of school buildings, while children in kindergarten to Grade 5 are encouraged to do so. Teachers for kindergarten to Grade 8 can choose whether they want to wear a mask or shield in the classroom while teachers for Grades 9-12 will be required to wear one when they cannot physically distance from students.

Transportation: Curtains will be installed inside school buses to separate drivers from students. If physical distancing is not possible, drivers will be required to wear a mask or face shield. Students must sit in the same seat every day. Students in kindergarten to Grade 5 will sit alone or with a member of their household. Students in Grades 6-12 wearing masks will sit two to a seat, and if they are sitting alone or with a member of their household, they do not have to wear a mask.

New routines: Arrivals, breaks and lunches are to be staggered. Public access to school buildings will be limited, and students, staff and visitors may also be subject to screening. High school students will be expected to have their own laptop or similar device, and some subsidies will be available. Drinking fountains will be replaced with water bottle-filling stations.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND

Schools on the Island are preparing to welcome all students back to class, while drafting backup plans for remote studies if required.

Back to class: Schools are to reopen for teachers and staff on Sept. 1 and for students on Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be organized into cohorts when possible and limit their exposure to others.

Physical distancing: Students will be taught about the importance of physical distancing, and extra teaching and cleaning staff may be hired. Schools are also asked to reduce class sizes as much as possible, reconfigure classrooms and make use of spaces such as libraries and multipurpose rooms.

Masks: The province says all staff and students in Grades 7-12 are ""strongly recommended"" to wear masks when physical distancing cannot be maintained. Students from kindergarten through Grade 6 may wear masks when physical distancing is impossible. Staff interacting with children who have complex medical needs are strongly recommended to wear face shields and gloves.

Transportation: Parents are asked to take their kids to school whenever possible. To reduce the number of riders on buses, schools may add vehicles and routes or implement walk-to-school programs. It is strongly recommended that all students and drivers wear masks on the bus.

New routines: P.E.I. education authorities are revising curricula for this school year to make up for learning gaps caused by lockdown constraints. Schools will stagger schedules to minimize congestion. The provincial school food program will be expanded next year in keeping with public health precautions. Elementary school students will stay in their classrooms for lunch.

NOVA SCOTIA

Education Minister Zach Churchill says the province's objective is for schools to return to 100 per cent capacity in the fall, but its plan includes measures to address the possible onset of a second wave of COVID-19.

Back to class: The province aims to have all elementary and high school students in classrooms by Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be asked to keep to cohorts.

Physical distancing: Students and staff will be encouraged to maintain a two-metre distance whenever possible. Lecture rooms will be reorganized to increase space between desks.

Masks: All students in grades 4 to 12 will be required to wear a mask inside schools except when seated at desks that are two metres apart and facing the same direction. Masks must be worn in hallways and other common areas if a two-metre distance cannot be maintained. All students and staff will receive two free cloth masks. Disposable masks will be available if a student loses theirs or comes to school without one.

Transportation: Students who take the school bus will be required to wear non-medical masks.

New routines: Only students and staff will be permitted to enter school buildings. When possible, teachers will be asked to move their classes outdoors. Students will be asked to bring their own computers to school, and the province says it has acquired an additional 14,000 devices for those with limited access to technology. The ventilation systems of each school will be assessed to ensure the equipment is operating properly.

Backup plans: If a COVID-19 outbreak occurs during the academic year, schools will move to a blended learning model with smaller class sizes and home learning for older students.

NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR

The province's back-to-school plan aims to maximize in-class attendance with the option of a return to remote learning if the COVID-19 risk increases.

Back to class: The province's plan outlines three scenarios — in-class instruction, remote learning or a combination of both, depending on the COVID-19 risk in a particular community. The Newfoundland and Labrador English School District said in person classes will resume in September given low case numbers in the province and families can apply to homeschool their children.

Groups: Cohorting by class is recommended when feasible, but students' schedules shouldn't be disrupted to support smaller groupings. In the English School District, high school students will not be grouped by cohorts due to curriculum requirements.

Physical distancing: Schools should aim to create a two-metre distance between desks, or as close to that as possible. The English School District says signage will be placed inside schools reminding people about physical distancing.

Masks: Masks must be worn on school buses and in communal areas of high schools but they are not required inside classrooms. Staff will not be required to wear masks if physical distancing is possible. The province's English School District will provide two masks for each teacher and one for each student.

Transportation: Bus drivers and riders will be required to wear masks. The English School District has said bus ridership will be limited to 46 students per bus and up to 6,000 students may need to make alternate transportation arrangements.

New routines: All students must bring their own supplies in keeping with a ""no sharing"" policy. Students are advised to bring their own water bottles.

Backup plans: In the event of moderate-to-widespread transmission of COVID-19, school districts will move to online learning. Classroom attendance should be limited to about 50 per cent when the COVID-19 risk in a community is considered low to moderate. Newfoundland and Labrador says it will spend $20 million to purchase laptops for teachers and students in Grades 7 through 12 to support remote learning.

YUKON

The territorial government says it's making plans for the next school year that include flexibility around the number of students in classes if there's a second wave of COVID-19 or increased risk of transmission. It says each school will determine how it will adjust its operations to meet those guidelines, and school principals and staff are expected to share that information prior to September.

Back to class: Preliminary plans indicate that in rural communities, all students will return to school full time. In Whitehorse, however, kids in kindergarten through Grade 9 will return to full-day in-school instruction, while Grades 10 to 12 will spend half their day in the classroom, and the rest learning remotely.

Groups: Class sizes may be smaller to meet safety restrictions.

Masks: Wearing masks is a personal choice.

Transportation: Bus school and schedules will be posted to the territory's website.

New routines: Schedule shakeups may mean that some students won't have their regular teacher or the same classmates. School meal programs may be adapted with new safety measures and pickup options.

Backup plans: The territory has outlined a spectrum of school options if the risk to the community increases, ranging from rotating schedules to suspension of face-to-face learning.

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES

All N.W.T. schools have submitted plans to reopen their doors this fall. The territory says education authorities are taking a flexible approach in their planning to account for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall.

Back to class: While plans will vary from school to school, the territory will offer in-person instruction whenever possible, while ensuring alternative options are available.

Groups: Students in kindergarten through Grade 6 will be in classroom ""bubbles,"" and won't have to practise physical distancing within these groups.

Physical distancing: For Grades 7 to 9, students are asked to maintain a one-metre distance from each other, and two-metre distance from staff. Grade 10 to 12 students are asked to allow for two metres of distance from their peers and instructors.

Masks: Students of all ages may be required to wear masks in situations where physical distance cannot be practised, such as moving through the hallways.

Transportation: There may be changes to bus schedules, and all riders will be required to wear masks.

New routines: More time will be spent learning outside. School hours and schedules may also look different. Students are asked to label personal items and not share.

Backup plans: The territory says schools are preparing to shift between in-person, distance and blended learning at short notice should there become active COVID-19 cases.

NUNAVUT

The territory has released a four-stage plan for reopening schools based on the risk of the novel coronavirus in a community.

Back to class: There are no reported COVID-19 cases in Nunavut, so all schools are set to reopen this fall with enhanced cleaning and safety precautions.

Groups: It is recommended that schools cohort students by class and limit mixing as much as possible.

Physical distancing: Distance requirements will depend on what stage a community is in, and will primarily be achieved by limiting school attendance.

Masks: In most cases, the use of masks is not recommended for children. If there are exceptions, parents will be notified, and masks will be provided.

Transportation: As it stands, bus schedules are set to resume. Students older than 13 may be required to wear masks.

New routines: Group activities will be limited. Students won't be allowed to share food in lunchrooms.

Backup plans: The territory says schools could go part-time if contact tracing were to identify a possible source of COVID-19. All schools would be closed if community transmission were to take place.

Pandher, who lives near Whitehorse, has been dancing and travelling his way across Vancouver Island over the past week trying to spread a message of positivity during COVID-19.

""(The pandemic) created a lot of pressure and stresses. Some people are sharing it, some people are not, but everybody is feeling it ... I'd like to say be happy, be hopeful, even though it's hard,"" Pandher said in an interview.

He rose to fame with a series of viral videos showcasing his bhangra skills, dancing alongside members of the Canadian Armed Forces, local politicians and first responders.

Bhangra is a lively form of dance to music, originating from the Punjab region in India and characterized by leaps, kicks and arm movement.

""Bhangra has a lot of elements of positivity and happiness, and it's very high-energy,"" Pandher said. ""It's a workout dance, it's a happy dance, it brings people together.""

Pandher has been practising bhangra most of his life, punctuated by small breaks every now and then, but he's recently turned it into a full-time job, teaching it online to help those feeling cooped up due to the pandemic.

""Many professionals, doctors, high commissioners, politicians, they were taking these classes. I was quite touched,"" he said.

Yukon imposed COVID-19 border restrictions when the pandemic first hit, but opened its border to B.C. in July, prompting a vacation idea from Pandher.

""Vancouver Island is kind of like the Yukon. It's known for its wilderness, its natural beauty, the people and also the great thing is that both areas are remote,"" he said, clarifying that while not as remote as Yukon, Vancouver Island still had an ocean separating it from its mainland neighbours.

That separation was part of the reason for the holiday choice, as Pandher believes it helps protect it from COVID-19 outbreaks.

It's not the dance instructor's first visit to the island.

He previously visited the Canadian Armed Forces base in Esquimalt, leading 15 members in a bhangra session.

He said he's been stopped and visited by fans during this most recent trip, with a particular highlight being a visit and dance session with firefighters in Nanaimo and an attempt to surf at Tofino.

""It's just like dancing bhangra,"" Pander said of surfing. ""In bhangra you need to co-ordinate a lot of movements to put it together — same with surfing: balance, co-ordination — and just being on the beach and in the water was awesome.""

Pandher is scheduled to leave B.C. on Sunday but hopes to come back again in the future.

He says it drew a crowd, but officers were able to break it up.

Video of the party was shared on social media, and appeared to show a crowd of people dancing in close quarters.

Chow says groups of people have been congregating around music or buskers outside because there aren't many indoor options available during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The trend has prompted celebrities to respond to a plea from Premier John Horgan for help with messaging to younger residents about partying during the pandemic.

Vancouver-born actor and comedian Seth Rogen tweeted on Saturday that the ""people of British Columbia"" should forego parties, barbecues and other gatherings in favour of more low-key activities.

""It's more fun to hang out alone and smoke weed and watch movies and TV shows anyway!"" he wrote. ""Do that instead!""

British Columbia has seen a rise in cases over the past week, reporting 85, 78 and 84 new cases on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday respectively.

Previously, actor Ryan Reynolds lent his voice to the cause.

On Friday he posted a voice recording on Twitter, framed as a voicemail left for Horgan, warning B.C.'s younger residents of the dangers of COVID-19.

""Young folks in B.C., they're partying, which is of course dangerous,"" he said in the recording. ""They probably don't know that thousands of young people aren't just getting sick of coronavirus, they're dying of it too.""

He urged them not to kill some of B.C.'s coolest residents — including David Suzuki and Reynold's mom.

""Let's not kill anyone,"" he said. ""I think that's reasonable.""

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said Thursday that people between the ages of 20 and 29 now make up the group seeing the largest increase of infections.

As of Friday, 4,358 people in British Columbia had tested positive for the virus, the majority of whom have recovered. Public health officials have recorded 196 deaths linked to the virus.

Rogen joins fellow Vancouverite turned Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds in encouraging young British Columbians to stop partying amid the pandemic.

Reynolds, star and producer of the Deadpool franchise, responded to Horgan's plea in a Tweet Friday, stating, ""I got your message about the thing. Look, I'm not sure it's a great idea, frankly. People don't want medical advice from guys like me.""

Following his joke, Reynolds underscored that many young people may not realize how many young people are getting sick from COVID-19 and that many of them are dying.

Reynolds continued to inject levity into the serious message by saying that his mom would also like to be out having fun on Kitsilano Beach, and that he hoped that young people in the province would keep both her and Canadian icon David Suzuki safe during the health crisis.

""I hope that young people in B.C. don't kill my mom, frankly, or David Suzuki,"" said Reynolds.

With active COVID-19 cases at their highest in three months, earlier this week Horgan hinted at a carrot and stick approach to British Columbians — and especially younger people — to heed health and safety guidelines.

Provincial health officials announced 85 new cases Wednesday, Aug. 12, the highest one-day total for the province since late April. By Friday, B.C. had recorded its highest three-day total since the pandemic began.

This week, Horgan said if private house parties continue to contribute to the growing caseload in the province, enforcement will follow suit, with warnings escalating into more severe penalties.

A string of public exposure alerts has been issued recently for private parties, bars, restaurants, night clubs and stores across the Lower Mainland. Health officials also continue to flag flights through Vancouver for exposure to the virus.

Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a joint statement Friday that several bars, restaurants and nightclubs in the Vancouver Coastal Health region have been closed following transmission events, “some by public health order and others voluntarily.”

More than 70 new cases have been reported in B.C. over each of the past three days. On Friday, B.C.’s new cases totalled 84, and total active cases numbered 629.

Since late June, the majority of new cases have been driven by young people, particularly the 20 to 29 age group, as well as people in their 30s.

Henry has also cautioned that young people aren’t immune to long-lasting effects of COVID-19 – such as extreme fatigue and breathing difficulties – even if they were never hospitalized and their illness was relatively mild.

Meanwhile, the latest modelling by B.C.’s health agency, presented Thursday, suggests that the number of COVID-19 cases could soar to levels higher than was seen in April.

If the current rate of social contacts – which is sitting at 70 per cent of pre-pandemic levels – continues, B.C. could see over 100 cases a day by September. The province has recommended people keep their contacts to 60 per cent or lower in order to avoid a surge in cases.

However, Henry has noted that models aren’t firm predictions – rather, they suggest what can happen.

Henry and Dix urged British Columbians Friday to “stay strong and hold the line” this weekend.

“We have it within our ability to make the changes we need to bend our pandemic curve back down and continue in our B.C. restart, but it takes the combined efforts of everyone, not just a few.”

Earlier this week, the province announced it would be hiring 500 more contact tracers in preparation for a potential surge of the virus in the fall. The contact tracers should be in place by September."

Ottawa announced Friday that asylum seekers working in specific jobs in the health-care sector would be eligible for permanent residency without first having to wait for their asylum claims to be accepted, as is typically the process.

Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino said the move came in response to public demand for so-called ""Guardian Angels"" — many in Quebec — to be recognized for their work.

""They demonstrated a uniquely Canadian quality in that they were looking out for others and so that is why is today is so special,"" Mendicino said in an interview Friday afternoon.

But asylum seekers and their supporters say Ottawa's plan excludes thousands of workers without permanent status in Canada who have laboured on the front lines during the pandemic, often at great personal risk to themselves and their families.

That includes security guards and janitorial staff, factory workers, and farm labourers, among others.

""I have friends who worked with me in security that abandoned (their posts) because they were afraid of getting infected. But I stayed,"" said Nguessan Bi.

He said he wants Trudeau and Quebec Premier Francois Legault to do something to help asylum seekers who are not eligible for the new program.

Several dozen people rallied in front of Trudeau's office on Saturday to demand permanent residency for all asylum seekers.

""It's an act of recognition. They deserve status,"" Joseph Clormeus, a member of Debout pour la dignite, a Montreal advocacy group that organized the rally, told the crowd.

Anite Presume, a Haitian asylum seeker who came to Quebec in August 2017 from the United States, was among the protesters.

She works in a medication factory, and said she kept working during the pandemic despite the risks.

""To take the bus, we were all stressed, but we still went to work because it was essential. They needed medication for the hospitals,"" she said in an interview.

She said she has not received a response yet to her application for asylum in Canada, and lives under a cloud of uncertainty and stress about her future.

""It's a feeling of rejection,"" Presume said, about not being included in Ottawa's regularization program. ""They rejected us as if we did nothing.""

To apply for residency under the new program, applicants must have claimed asylum in Canada prior to March 13 and have spent no less than 120 hours working as an orderly, nurse or another designated occupation between the date of their claim and Aug. 14.

They must also demonstrate they have six months of experience in the profession before they can receive permanent residency and have until the end of August 2021 to meet that requirement.

The program was the result of negotiations between the federal government and Quebec, who have had a strained relationship on the question of immigration, and in particular the asylum claimants, in recent years.

Public support has been building for asylum seekers' demand for permanent residency after it was revealed that refugee claimants were among those toiling in Quebec's long-term care facilities, which were hard-hit by COVID-19.

While the majority of B.C’s new cases have been reported in people under the age of 40 – many in the 20 to 29 demographic – the province is still seeing cases from air travel, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said during Thursday’s media briefing.

“We do continue to have introductions (of COVID-19) into the province from international travel,” she said.

“Some of these are temporary foreign workers, who have come in from countries, particularly Mexico, and a number of them have become ill while in quarantine.”

Henry added that the province has been providing quarantine support to all of the temporary foreign workers coming into B.C. for two weeks, prior to them going to work on farms.

Cases also continue to be linked to Canadians returning from abroad.

“As well, we continue to have Canadians returning from other places around the world, including recently, a number of people from India, from the U.S. and we have had a number of cases related to that as well.”

Former Powell River resident Kendyl Oele, a 26-year-old personal trainer who now lives in Calgary, became seriously ill after contracting COVID-19 at a spin class in July.

“It’s not a far-off issue,” said Oele. “It’s happening and it’s happening in your own backyard. If I can be that resource for people to understand, I’m so happy to do that.”

On a Friday in early July, Oele attended an early morning spin class in an underground studio in Calgary. She said she has been very aware of COVID-19 previous to when she became ill. She had gone to that particular spin studio a handful of times before she became ill and felt “pretty safe” at the facility.

“On that particular day that I did contract it, there was a fan there that had not been there previous to that and the fan did make me feel a little uncomfortable,” said Oele. “I just happened to be on the bike near the fan.”

She said when she was at the class, she was with a group of people who are highly physically active and in tip-top shape.

“You wouldn’t be able to go to the class if you were not so, so I kind of thought I was in a population that would be healthy,” said Oele. “I was assuming risk but I thought the risk was quite low. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case.”

Oele said the onset of her symptoms was quite sudden. She said most of the doctors she spoke with couldn’t believe they manifested themselves so quickly. The theory is because she was close to the fan, the viral load she was subjected to was quite high.

While the spin participants were physically distanced, and it was clean, unfortunately that day, there was a fan, and Oele wishes in hindsight that she had walked away.

She said she began to feel the effects of COVID-19 about three days after her exposure. She was notified by the spin studio on the Monday afternoon following the class that there had been a COVID-19 exposure, and by Monday evening, she was feeling “a little bit off.” She went into isolation that night. She was tested for COVID-19 on the Wednesday, less than a week after the exposure.

By the time she was tested, she was having trouble breathing. She called Alberta Health Services and was advised she needed to go to emergency, so she went straight to the hospital after calling 811. She was tested at emergency and it took fewer than 24 hours before she heard a positive diagnosis.

Her boyfriend also was tested, but his results came back negative.

While Oele was sitting in emergency, she said she was not fighting for breath but she had a feeling of heaviness in her chest. She said when speaking, she would be taking in a deep breath after each sentence. She said that was the only symptom she had up until that time, other than a runny nose.

While waiting for her COVID-19 test, Oele said she was rocked with a fever, chills and a headache.

“When I came home, I pretty much just fell asleep and then I was sleeping all day Thursday,” said Oele. “I pretty much knew that I had it. There was no thought in my mind that I randomly picked up a sickness. When Alberta Health Services called me and told me that I tested positive, I had kind of come to terms with the fact that I had COVID-19.”

Oele said her thinking was that she was in a demographic where she would be okay, so she was preparing for the worst but expecting the best.

“I’m very lucky that was the case,” she said. “When they told me I was positive I felt scared but also prepared.”

Oele didn’t expect her isolation to be so strict. She said she is very fortunate in that she has a bedroom with an en suite attached, so she did not leave her 200-square-foot space for the full length of the quarantine.

“I was stuck in the bedroom and the only time the door was opened was for food,” said Oele. “When it was open I had to wear a mask and anything was allowed to come in, but nothing was allowed to leave, so I had garbage bags that I had sealed with my plastic cutlery and paper plates.”

Contracting COVID-19 turned Oele’s life upside down. She said the worst period was the Thursday and Friday after exposure.

“My fever was constant,” she said. “I’ve had bad flus in the past but I genuinely felt like I’d been in a car accident. It took everything out of me to just stand up and go to the bathroom. I was sleeping about 16 hours a day and the only thing that would wake me up was when my Advil wore off. I would have such a severe headache.”

On the following Saturday, just a little more than a week after exposure, she began to feel better, but the breathing difficulty intensified. She said she was so fortunate that she never got to the point where she was actually gasping for air. Breathing was laboured, although it never hurt. Oele said it felt like something was pushing on her chest.

She said going from being so physically fit to not being able to stand for more than five minutes was shocking and made breathing so much harder.

Recovery is a slow process and Oele, more than a month later, is still dealing with a lot of after-effects. She’s been out of quarantine almost three weeks nowand feels about 80 per cent. Oele said her taste receptors are pretty much gone, as is her sense of smell. She still has trouble taking long walks with her dog, and with any uphill or stairs, she has to take breaks.

Oele said health professionals are currently monitoring her for blood clots and it’s possible her heart could become enlarged as well. She said the odds are quite low, given her demographic, and she will be getting checked out to make sure she’s okay physically.

“The point I really want to get across is that I, in a demographic where, if I get COVID-19, I am expected to be fine,” said Oele. “It’s supposed to be a bad flu and we come out of it completely fine. That has not been my experience. I would not wish this on anybody.

“I’m continuing to struggle and if I’m being honest, I don’t see an end in sight for my struggles in the near future. I think I’m going to be dealing with this for some time and I want that known. It’s a life-changing event.”"

The promise of new arrivals comes as Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, warned Friday that a fall surge of COVID-19 cases could overwhelm the health-care system, including its supply of critical care beds and ventilators.

article continues below

""What we know based on what we learned from other countries and cities that had a devastating impact in that initial wave, if you exceeded that capacity the mortality goes up really, really high,"" she said.

Flu season and other respiratory infections common in the fall could put added pressure on the system if COVID-19 flares up in a big way.

Tam said there were many lessons learned from the spring, when the government was ill-prepared and without enough protective equipment for health-care workers, and feared a massive surge of COVID-19 would overwhelm the health-care system.

""We are much better prepared than we were before,"" she said.

In March, Canadians watched in horror as northern Italy's COVID-19 outbreak overran its health-care system, leaving doctors to choose which patients got a ventilator and which were left without one. That experience, coupled with warnings it could happen here too, compelled federal and provincial governments to order thousands of new ventilators.

But much like surgical face masks and N95 respirators, Canada didn't already produce many ventilators domestically, and getting them from international sources is tough when global need for new ventilators is in the hundreds of thousands. So Canada asked firms here if they could step up, and out of that four new consortiums to build ventilators were formed.

A fifth contract was signed with Thornhill Medical, a Toronto firm that at that point was making about 50 of its portable breathing machines a month.

In all, Canada ordered 40,328 ventilators, for an estimated $1.1 billion, and as of Friday, it had just 606 in hand.

Paul-Emile Cloutier, the president of national health-care advocate HealthCareCAN, said there is concern about the status of the government's orders for personal protective equipment and ventilators ahead of the possibility COVID-19 will surge again in Canada this fall.

""Details are crucial as we prepare for the expected next wave of COVID-19,"" he said.

Procurement Minister Anita Anand said Friday the government is pushing on to get the entirety of the orders in place. A statement from her department said ""Canada currently has sufficient ventilators to meet current demands"" and that the ones on order are to bolster existing Public Health Agency of Canada stockpiles, as well as the units already in hospitals and provincial warehouses across the country.

But Health Canada won't say how many ventilators the country now has in total. It will also not disclose any modelling for how many could be needed in a worst-case scenario situation. In March there were about 5,000 ventilators nationally, and another 500 in the national emergency stockpile.

Canada's ability to plank the COVID-19 curve in the spring meant warnings about running out of ventilators never came to fruition.

John Walmsley, the executive vice president at Starfish Medical in Victoria, said that took the pressure off his new coalition, Canadian Emergency Ventilators, Inc.

""We have a little bit more elbow room to do things in a bit of a controlled manner but I would say we're looking to get it done this year,"" he said.

""We're all concerned about a second wave and being ready for that and so we're on board to deliver for that.""

Canadian Emergency Ventilators is still waiting for Health Canada approval before it can start shipping its promised 7,500 machines. It submitted the documents in June and it is taking a bit longer than expected to get the green light.

Once that happens, the Public Health Agency of Canada would have to test the product, and then the units that have already been built could be shipped, said Walmsley. He is still hopeful to fill the order by the end of the year.

Thornhill Medical CEO Lesley Gouldie said her company's partnership with Linamar, a manufacturer based in Guelph, Ont., has been a great success. Thornhill is to provide 1,020 machines to Canada, and has shipped 27 so far.

Gouldie said Linamar can make as many as 100 of the units a week, but getting the supplies for the 1,500 parts that make up their portable device proved to be difficult in a pandemic.

""The limiting factor is the supply chains,"" Gouldie said.

She said the kinks are mostly worked out now, and she expects to ship enough machines each week to fulfil their contract by early December.

Rick Jamieson, the CEO of FTI Professional Grade, said they expect to fulfil their entire contract for 10,000 ventilators by Dec. 12. FTI is one of several companies in a consortium called Ventilators for Canadians, which has already delivered 132 ventilators. Another 120 are on track for delivery next week and 240 in the last week of August.

""We have activated a fourth shift to increase production knowing that a second wave is likely this fall and winter,"" said Jamieson.

Montreal's CAE received Health Canada approval for its new ventilator on June 17, and said that day it expected to begin shipping ""hundreds each week."" It has a contract to deliver 10,000.

The federal government announced Friday that Canada and the U.S. agreed to keep the border closed for another month. Despite increased pressure from families like McCall's and others, Ottawa has yet to loosen the limits on who is allowed to enter the country.

Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino said in an interview he knows that many people are in heartbreaking situations and he sympathizes with them.

He said he is reflecting on whether more exemptions need to be made as the government seeks to meet its twin objectives of commitment to family reunification and protecting public health.

""The measures that we've put in place at the border are helping to reduce the spread of the virus and that is saving lives,"" he said.

""We have to balance both of these important objectives and commitments and we will do that.""

McCall had been trying for months to get his adult children up from the U.S. to care for their ailing mother Donna.

Urgent requests to the Immigration Department for some kind of exemption to the existing rules went unanswered.

So, the McCalls decided to do what they said, in retrospect, they should have done many years ago — apply for Canadian citizenship for the kids.

Donna was Canadian, John is American, though his family has roots in the area they now call home.

While immigration officials did eventually put a rush on Canadian citizenship papers for the two children, the documents didn't make it time: Donna died last Monday.

John McCall said he knows his isn't the only case where border restrictions are keeping families apart in life-or-death situations.

""My only goal now is to say, please don't let this happen to anyone else,"" he said, dissolving into tears.

Their son Ian, 33, said that before COVID-19, his family had gone back and forth across the border with ease, and while they'd talked about getting their citizenship, it just didn't seem urgent.

He said he's not angry the restrictions are in place, but wishes officers had shown more leniency while there was still time.

Saying goodbye to your mother over video chat isn't something anyone should have to go through, he said.

""There are no words to describe how hard it is,"" he said.

When the border initially closed back in March, there were very limited exceptions to who was allowed in, beyond Canadian citizens and permanent residents.

Those restrictions were eased in June to allow for some relatives to enter, a move Mendicino pointed to in the interview as proof of the government's commitment to family reunification.

Adult children of citizens, like the McCalls, were not on the list. Mendicino did not explain why when asked on Friday.

Others caught in limbo include people whose common-law relationships don't meet the definition of those that is set out in immigration law.

Many affected people have banded together into an advocacy group that held a press conference on Parliament Hill last Wednesday demanding change.

They've also tabled a petition in the House of Commons with over 5,300 signatures.

""We ask that a timetable and plan be developed to safely reunite our families, said David Poon, a Regina doctor whose partner is stuck in Ireland.

""The NHL was allowed a quarantine plan to keep themselves and their families safe — where is the one for Canadian families?""

• 2,276 in Fraser Health (up 34);

• 150 in Island Health (no change);

• 399 in Interior Health (up one);

• 107 in Northern Health (up one); and

No new deaths were recorded, leaving the province's death toll from the coronavirus at 196. There were 33 people who have newly recovered from the virus, bringing the total number of recoveries to 3,533.

One new health facility has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre. Another health-facility outbreak is active at Vancouver's Joseph and Rosalie Segal Health Family Health Centre.

Seven seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

The plan was for the national app to roll out first in Ontario, while the prime minister signalled B.C. would follow soon after as an early partner in the venture.

Two months after that announcement, the national COVID Alert app has not been deployed beyond Ontario’s borders, although Canadians are free to download it regardless of their location (CBC reports it’s been downloaded 1.9 million times).

And instead of next hitting the West Coast as originally appeared to be the case, the Atlantic provinces will be the next to adopt it, while Alberta has confirmed it’s shifting from its own app to the national app.

“I’m very much surprised and at the same time puzzled,” said Mimik Technology Inc. CEO Fay Arjomandi.

She addressed a House of Commons standing committee May 21 to brief parliamentarians on the Vancouver company’s own contact-tracing app, Pandimik.

The federal government ultimately opted for an app developed in collaboration between the Canadian Digital Service, the Government of Ontario, BlackBerry Ltd. and Shopify Inc.

But Arjomandi told BIV she made it clear to those in the federal government her company’s contact-tracing would be ready to roll out much sooner, hence her surprise by how long it took for Ontario to launch the app.

She said the made-in-B.C. app has been enjoying quick adoption by enterprise clients eager to get employees back into workplace quickly while keeping their data secure and private.

But Arjomandi said privacy concerns remain over the COVID Alert app, such as issues in which users find themselves redirected from the app to a web portal to submit personal data.

B.C. provincial health officer Bonnie Henry told reporters she’s not sure when the app will make its debut on the West Coast while it still undergoes some “tweaking” in Ontario.

“We are supportive of having a single app in Canada,” she said, describing contact tracing as the “bread and butter” of public health.

“We’ve been working with them on how we can tailor it to be a tool that supports the work that we’re doing in contact tracing.”

But Henry said individuals on the ground – those that can talk to potential COVID-19 patients about their risks and steps they need to take next – remain the best resources for contact tracing.

“There’s no electronic magic bullet that can take that away,” she said.

“We’re hopeful it will be something we’ll be able to use to supplement and support our contact tracing.”

Earlier this week the province announced it was hiring 500 temporary contact tracers to work within individual health regions.

If a user tests positive for COVID-19, a health-care professional helps the patient anonymously upload their status on the COVID Alert app. The app will then alert other users who’ve been in close contact with the COVID-19-positive patient.

No personal information is ever shared and no location services information is collected.

Trudeau said the federal government consulted with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, and has insisted the app itself would not share any identifiers such as a phone number or address.

Instead, the app generates a randomized code used for alerts.

The code is stored in what the prime minister described as a secure national database.

The Pandimik app used by enterprise clients tracks and logs the proximity of individuals’ devices to one another.

If an app user discovers they’ve tested positive for COVID-19, they’re able to alert other app users with whom they’ve shared close contact via an alert that would appear on those other devices.

Mimik does not report the location of users to third parties and it does not retain users’ personal information.

Instead, the company uses edge-computing technology to ensure all data remains on the users’ respective devices.

Arjomandi said adoption, anonymity and adaptability will be the key to any contact-tracing app’s success in Canada, adding that a national app’s effectiveness will likely require at least half the general public to download it.

The app will also need to be able to interact with multiple health care partners across the provinces while maintaining data security, she said.

“I don’t have a crystal ball,” Arjomandi said, referring to a potential successful deployment in B.C.

“Time will tell but they [federal government] already made indications – it’s the end of August and we don’t have it anywhere else. It’s Ontario only.”"

Last month, the provincial government announced that renters will be expected to pay rent in full on Sept. 1, and renters with outstanding rent payments from March 18 to Aug. 17 will have until at least July 2021 to pay back what they owe.

The first repayments will not start until October at the earliest.

The terms of the repayment plan must include:

Amount of outstanding rent

Start date of the repayment plan

Amount of each installment

Dates for each installment

The repayment installments must begin at least 30 days after the date that the landlord gives the plan to the renter.

The plan must also give renters until July 2021 to repay the amount owed, unless the landlord and renter agree to a longer repayment period.

And while the rent will be paid back in equal installments, the province says that renters and landlords have the option of agreeing to smaller amounts being paid each month, in the beginning of the repayment process.

The installments must also be paid on the same date that rent is due.

Meanwhile, landlords are temporarily prohibited from increasing rent until December 2020. According to the province, if a renter has been issued a notice of rent increase for an earlier date, they shouldn’t pay the increase and instead continue to pay their current amount until December.

The Temporary Rental Supplement also remains available until Aug. 31.

To date, the supplement has assisted over 86,000 households with paying their rent during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Renters still experiencing a loss of income may also qualify for the Rental Assistance Program or the Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters – programs which provide ongoing rental subsidies to low- and moderate-income families and seniors."

That’s what B.C’s workplace safety regulator wants to buy as part of promotional merchandise offerings.

article continues below

Meanwhile, cash problems prevent WorkSafeBC from assisting employers with COVID-19 personal protective equipment (PPE).

BC NDP cabinet members won’t discuss the issue but the Liberal opposition is livid.

WorkSafeBC put out a request for proposals (RFP) August 4 seeking 250 stress balls; 3,000 pens, 50 microfleece hoodies; 50 soft-shell jackets; 1,000 tote bags; 500 embossed, leather-bound journals; 250 ball caps; 250 tumblers, 1,000 lanyards; 250 power bank chargers; 500 reflective safety flashers and 250 stainless steel water bottles.

Items were to be branded for WorkSafeBC – which has adopted the slogans, ‘We’re doing our part’ or ‘I’m doing my part’ in its COVID-19 messaging.

The request was published on the BCBid site for government contracts this week.

The workplace safety regulator is in charge of setting and enforcing the rules for reopening businesses closed by the pandemic.

However, WorkSafeBC can’t afford to help businesses buy protective equipment because it has lost much of its $2.9 billion surplus in the recent stock market collapse, it was revealed in May.

That meant WorkSafeBC didn’t have a surplus to give employers partial refunds for masks, gloves, Plexiglas shields and other safety gear, NDP Labour Minister Harry Bains said at the time.

Bains’ office referred questions about the swag RFP to the regulator. Requests to Premier John Horgan were unanswered.

“It’s pretty bizarre,” Liberal opposition labour critic John Martin said. “It’s odd.”

He said thousands of businesses are struggling with increased operating costs and revenue, they need all the help they can get right now to keep their doors open.

“[Bains] really needs to explain this spending for swag,” the Chilliwack MLA said.

WorkSafeBC director of government and media relations Craig Fitzsimmons said current contracts for branded, promotional merchandise expire Jan. 31.

“We are seeking proposals through an open, fair, and transparent competitive bidding process,” he said.

He said the merchandise has two main purposes – for purchase by staff or for WorkSafeBC booths at health and safety conferences.

“The budgets for branded merchandise are set within WorkSafeBC departments, depending on their needs,” Fitzsimmons said.

He said the quantities listed in the RFP are estimates only to allow interested suppliers to propose pricing.

“The eventual contracts will be a standing agreement and purchases will be made on an as needed basis,” her said. “This means that if there isn’t a need for the branded merchandise, we won’t be buying any.”

Fitzsimmons stressed WorkSafeBC is aware many businesses are struggling during the pandemic.

“That’s why WorkSafeBC has allowed employers who pay their premiums quarterly to defer payments for six months,” Fitzsimmons said. “WorkSafeBC also announced in late May that it was waiving premiums on wages paid to furloughed workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy.”

He said that change was retroactive to the March 15, 2020, start date of the subsidy and will continue for the duration of the program.

Martin said he understands having promotional merchandise available but said the timing couldn’t be worse.

“Put it on ice,” Martin said.

The agency’s priority right now should be worker safety, he said, noting the Liberals have proposed subsidizing PPE up to 30% of premiums.

On the WorkSafeBC finance side, Fitzsimmons said, “WorkSafeBC continues to exceed its target funding level, despite the volatility from the COVID-19 pandemic, with current funding estimates in the 145-150% range.”

“At this point, WorkSafeBC does not have a reliable estimate of expected investment income, premium revenues or claims costs for the year,” he added. “As such, we will not know the final impact of COVID-19 on our financial position for some time.”

“We do know that younger people are very likely to have very mild illness,” said Henry.","While some people can develop severe illness from COVID-19, others may have impacts lasting weeks or months – even if they were never hospitalized, and had a “relatively mild illness.”

That’s according to Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, who added that young people are telling of symptoms such as “fatigue – like difficulty even sitting up – profound fatigue that lasts for a long period of time.”

article continues below

Meanwhile, for people who have pneumonias, longer-lasting symptoms have included difficulty breathing and shortness of breath that can “last for a long time,” she said, during Thursday's COVID-19 media briefing.

There’s also a sub-group of people, more likely men than women – although Henry said the reasons for this aren’t completely understood – who have increased clotting in their blood which can lead to clotting of the arteries around the heart as well as heart attacks, challenges with brain injury or pulmonary embolism.

Some of those effects can happen “weeks later,” said Henry.

Young teenagers and young adults also aren't immune to longer-term impacts. There's a post-viral syndrome – seen in this demographic around the world – that can cause inflammation of the blood vessels, she said.

According to the U.S. Centres for Disease Control (CDC), MIS-C syndrome is a condition where body parts – such as the heart, lungs, kidneys, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs – can become inflamed.

The CDC notes that the syndrome has been seen in children.

While B.C. hasn’t yet seen any positive cases of MIS-C syndrome, Henry said health officials have been watching for it.

“So we are learning more, and we are learning that there can be long-term impacts that can be quite severe even for young people, that last – we only have months to go (by) right now – but that have lasted for many weeks and months for some people,” she said.

No evidence of virus mutation

Henry said there’s no evidence that the virus has mutated in B.C., although that’s something that has been seen in other places.

And when it does mutate, it does so “relatively slowly” compared to other viruses like influenza, which change rapidly.

“There’s a couple of reasons why that’s important,” said Henry. “It means that immunity is likely to last for a longer period of time. It also means that the chances of a vaccine being effective for a longer period of time, and in a broader population, is slightly more likely. So that (mutation) is something we watch really, really carefully.”

Virus is ‘quite stealthy’

While young people are more likely to have milder symptoms of COVID-19, some older patients in long-term care have also shown little to no symptoms at all, according to B.C.’s top doctor.

“We do know that younger people are very likely to have very mild illness,” said Henry.

“Having said that, we also found a very similar thing in elderly people, particularly our elders in long-term care – that sometimes they have very little to no symptoms at all, mostly things like fatigue, or they may not have had a fever, for example.

“So this virus has proven to be quite stealthy in that way, and that makes it a challenge for us. That’s why it’s so important that we reduce our potential for getting exposed in the first place.”

She also stressed the importance of getting tested, as people may not recognize they have symptoms of the virus.

“That’s why we’re saying, (any symptoms), go get tested, particularly if you’ve been at one of the exposure events, and people know who they are,” said Henry, adding that the province has done over 3,800 tests in the last 24 hours.

Some of those tests were people who tested positive Thursday.

B.C. reported 78 new cases Thursday, for a total of 4,274. There are currently 578 active cases in the province."

National modelling projections released Friday show an expected peak in cases this fall, followed by ongoing ups and downs, which chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam says could overwhelm health systems in different parts of the country.

That's why health officials across Canada are now getting ready for outbreaks that could surpass the highest spikes of the virus experienced in March and April, to ensure they're ready for the worst.

""It's preparing for — something could happen to this virus, who knows? Something could change,"" Tam told reporters Friday in Ottawa.

""We don't know the seasonality of this virus, it's continued throughout the summer, that's for sure, but what if it demonstrates a certain type of acceleration under certain conditions?""

Canada is better prepared than it was when the pandemic first hit the country this spring, she said, but officials are now planning for the likelihood of concurrent outbreaks of seasonal influenza, other respiratory illnesses and COVID-19 this fall and winter.

""We are over-planning beyond what we had for the previous wave and I think that's the prudent thing to do,"" Tam said.

""This planning scenario is to get all of our partners up and down the health system to over-plan.""

Increases in infection rates of COVID-19 are expected as economic and social activities resume, even with appropriate controls in place, according to the projection models.

The data released Friday suggests the number of cases by Aug. 23 could be as high as 127,740 and the number of deaths could reach as high as 9,115.

It also shows ""peaks and valleys"" of outbreaks are expected to continue in Canada until January 2022.

Continuing to build up capacity within the health system, while encouraging people to follow best public health practices, will give Canada the best chance of keeping the epidemic on a ""slow burn,"" Tam said, while also preparing for a need to quickly ramp up response measures if case numbers spike.

The lesson learned from other countries and cities that suffered devastating impacts during their initial wave of COVID-19 is that ""if you exceeded that capacity, the mortality goes up really, really high,"" Tam said.

""That's why you want to keep it below that capacity threshold in terms of activity.""

One method to stop large outbreaks is to ensure people who are infected can be identified and quarantined as soon as possible, Tam said.

That's why officials believe the COVID-19 exposure mobile application will be an important tool.

The pilot launch of the COVID Alert app in Ontario has seen two million people, out of a provincial population of 14 million, download the app to date. Tam says she finds that encouraging.

Meanwhile, provinces bracing for outbreaks of flu and other seasonal illnesses in addition to a second wave of the novel coronavirus are stocking up on this year's influenza vaccine and on personal protective equipment, she added.

Deputy chief health officer Dr. Howard Njoo said Friday he believes Canada has enough materials to also ramp up testing for COVID-19 in the event of a fall peak, thanks to ongoing bulk purchases by the federal government.

This is the fifth time that the closure has been extended since it was implemented in March. Since then, nearly 13,000 travellers have been refused entry to Canada, according to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).

However, the land border remains open to essential workers, such as truck drivers and health care professionals. Meanwhile, Canadians can still travel to the U.S. by air.

Last month, the federal government also took steps to close the so-called Alaska loophole. Currently, U.S. travellers headed to the northern state are limited to five crossings in Western Canada, must take a direct route, and report to CBSA officers when they leave the country."

Whereas between 40 and 45% of Latin Americans, West (including Arab) and South Asians reported having difficulty seeing their financial needs, only 29% of the category listed as ""Caucasians"" said they had experienced such difficulty.

“We’re starting to see the first families who have an active member with COVID,” said Byron Cruz, head of the group Sanctuary Health which has been supporting Latin American families struggling to pay rent and buy groceries throughout the pandemic.

“It’s definitely getting closer.”

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry reported the results of the province-wide survey Thursday, Aug. 13, in a rebuke of the notion that COVID-19 is ""a great leveler"" and on a day where another 78 new cases brought the total number of active cases in the province to 578, the most since the first week of May.

The survey found that respondents with the lowest income reported suffering the most, whether because they couldn’t meet their financial needs, had trouble accessing food or missed out on work. Those identifying themselves as Latin American, West Asian and Black were most likely to report not working due to COVID-19.

British Columbians surviving on lower incomes were also found to have an increased concern for health, were less likely to have the ability to stay home from work when sick, and more likely to have difficulty in accessing health care.

“The number of calls I’ve been getting is more than usual,” said Cruz.

Sanctuary Health works with migrants with precarious immigration status who are often ineligible for government supports. Lately, Cruz said he has been getting more requests for food deliveries from families his group never had contact with in the past, and requests for some kind of housing has seen an uptick as people are unable to pay their rent.

As many British Columbians can attest, the pandemic has wreaked havoc on people's anxieties as much as their finances.

While the survey found Latin Americans were the most likely to report an increased connection to family throughout the pandemic, children of those families were more likely to report increased levels of stress.

“Families are our main emotional support,” said Cruz “But we know that our families back home are in worse situations than we are here.”

That means sending home remittances at sometimes unsustainable levels, a heavy burden that is taxing on both bank accounts and stress levels.

Cruz said many of the 150-plus families his organization supports have had family members die from COVID-19 in places like Mexico and Guatemala, and his Nicaraguan neighbours have lost both parents back home as the virus rages across Latin America.

But even Cruz, who has a regular job and pay, said he’s feeling the pressure. He supports both his parents who have been shut in for three months in the highlands of Guatemala. Added to that, Cruz said he’s had to support his sister, who was forced to close her restaurant, and his brother, whose sandal factory has slowed to a crawl.

“That is a similar situation to so many people,” he said.

When he looks closer to home, Cruz and his organization worry that a spike in cases in the fall could decimate the non-profit's resources when people need it most. On Thursday, modelling from the province suggests the number of new daily COVID-19 cases could soar to over 100 cases per day, levels higher than their peak in April.

Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino announced the program Friday in response to public demand that the so-called ""Guardian Angels"" — many in Quebec — be recognized for their work in the health-care sector during the pandemic.

article continues below

Ordinarily, asylum seekers must wait for their claims to be accepted before they can become permanent residents, but the new program waives that requirement.

To apply for residency now, they must have claimed asylum in Canada prior to March 13 and have spent no less than 120 hours working as an orderly, nurse or another designated occupation between the date of their claim and Aug. 14.

Applicants must also demonstrate they have six months of experience in the profession before they can receive permanent residency and have until the end of Aug. 2021 to meet that requirement.

In an interview Friday, Mendicino called the announcement historic, and a reflection of the fact asylum claimants put themselves at risk to contribute day-after-day on the front lines, in hospitals and in retirement homes, even without permanent status in Canada.

""They demonstrated a uniquely Canadian quality in that they were looking out for others and so that is why is today is so special,"" he said.

The new program was the result of negotiations between the federal government and Quebec, who have had a strained relationship on the question of immigration, and in particular the asylum claimants, in recent years.

Quebec has housed many of the nearly 60,000 people who requested asylum in Canada after crossing on foot into the country from the U.S., the majority using an entry point in Quebec called Roxham Road.

The provincial government had long called for Ottawa to do more to stem the flow of people and also increase financial support to Quebec to deal with the new arrivals and the pressures they were placing on local resources.

But during the height of the COVID-19 crisis, when it emerged that refugee claimants were among those toiling in Quebec's hard-hit long-term care facilities, public support began to build in favour of granting them special residency status.

Frantz Andre, a Haitian community organizer in Montreal who advocates on behalf of asylum seekers, said he had received calls from many people expressing relief that they now have a path to permanent status.

""I'm very happy with the decision the government took because it provides a lot of relief and comfort,"" Andre said in an interview.

But, he said, the government's plan is bittersweet because many front-line workers are still ineligible for regularization. ""We're not giving up yet,"" Andre said. ""We're hoping we can influence the federal government and Quebec that they should enlarge their program.""

That was echoed by Wilner Cayo, president of Debout pour la dignite, a Montreal group that has pushed for the federal government to grant permanent status to all asylum seekers working on the front lines.

Cayo said Ottawa's plan excludes thousands of asylum seekers whose jobs were deemed ""essential"" during the pandemic, such as cooks or security guards in Quebec's long-term care homes, as well as labourers on farms and at food processing plants.

""We're treating these workers like disposable products,"" Cayo said in an interview. ""Yes, we salute this first step in the right direction, but we are profoundly shocked by these workers who are deemed essential but are left on the sidelines.""

Quebec Premier Francois Legault said earlier this year that while he was grateful for the asylum seekers' work, he was concerned that granting them fast-tracked residency status would encourage even more people to cross the border.

Speaking to reporters in Chibougamau, Que., Friday morning, Legault said he did not know how many asylum seekers would be eligible for the regularization program. But, he said, he was happy his government could come to an agreement with Ottawa.

""I'm happy to see the Quebec and federal governments work together for asylum seekers (who) took risks by working in the health-care system during the pandemic,"" Legault said. ""To thank them, we'll accept them as immigrants.""

At the news conference in Montreal, Mendicino said the Quebec government was a positive force in putting together the agreement.

He said efforts were made to allow as many people as possible to apply, and there is still some flexibility in the criteria, especially if people weren't able to work the required number of hours because they contracted COVID-19.

But Mendicino said the program was designed with strict parameters limiting who is eligible. ""This is about recognizing an exceptional contribution during a very exceptional period of time and we feel that will come across very clearly,"" he told The Canadian Press.

Many asylum seekers entered Canada at unofficial border points to get around a deal between Canada and the U.S. called the Safe Third Country Agreement.

Under the agreement, which took effect in 2004, Canada and the U.S. recognize each other as safe places to seek protection. It means Canada can turn back potential refugees who arrive at land ports of entry along the Canada-U.S. border on the basis they must pursue their claims in the U.S., the country where they first arrived.

A federal judge in July, however, struck down that agreement and gave Canada six months to change it before it becomes invalid.

Mendicino said the government is still reviewing the ruling. He pointed out the border is currently closed to most asylum seekers, under restrictions designed to limit the spread of COVID-19.

Based on the assumption that the trends in current caseloads continue, the province could see caseloads upwards of 100 per day come September.

Yet, as Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has noted, models aren’t forecasts and new cases depend on a collection of individual behaviours and no small dose of chance encounters.

On Wednesday, the province announced it would be hiring another 500 contact tracers across B.C. Their role in tracking down new cases and severing transmission chains has proved to be a key buffer against the renewed growth in cases, said Dr. Henry.

“We are at the point right now that we not only find everybody but that we do it in a timely way,” she said.

Still, Dr. Henry announced another 78 cases Thursday, Aug. 13, bringing the total active cases in the province up to 578, the highest total since May 8. Since July 30, the number of active COVID-19 cases has increased with every update from health officials.

The solid line represents the mean, whereas the shaded bands show 50% and 90% credible intervals. Open circles show reported cases. Note that the cases used for model fitting exclude outbreak clusters. - BCCDC

The bulk of those cases are now in Metro Vancouver, including at least two recent links to Coquitlam bars. But as the bulk of transmissions shifts to a younger demographic, deaths have plummeted, with only one fatality attributed to COVID-19 in August so far.

In the lab, Dr. Henry said the province is continuing to build up its testing capacity as we move into the fall. Turnaround time now sits at about a day, and over the last 24 hours, the province has completed roughly 3,800 tests.

As the province moves closer to a Sept. 10 school start date, the BC Centre for Disease Control’s COVID-19 modelling appeared to back the message that children are less susceptible to falling ill from the virus.

Of the roughly 468,000 children under 10-year-old in B.C., 78 have tested positive for the coronavirus. That represents only 2% of all COVID-19 cases, even though the group represents 9% of all people in the province.

Another 162 young people aged 10 to 19 have reportedly fallen ill with the virus. In a population of about 507,000 people, representing 10% of B.C.’s population, that accounts for only 4% of all cases.

“The percentage of children who get ill and who get this virus is still much less than their respective proportion in the population,” said Dr. Henry in response to a reporter’s question Thursday regarding reports of a 40% increase in the number of cases among children in the U.S.

“It does not surprise me. It concerns me immensely,” she said, adding that transmission in school settings is a reflection of caseloads in a community.

If active cases remain high, exposure to the virus is likely to occur at some point in B.C. schools, and under the worst-case scenario, a learning group of 60 or 120 will have to self-isolate.

“We have to have some flexibility in case something like that happens,” she said."

Adrian Dix says parties may not be immediately shut down but there would be consequences for those found flouting the rules.

""(Private parties) have been a significant source of problems,"" he said at a press conference on Thursday.

""I have to say this, if you're thinking of organizing a party — especially one involving alcohol, where there's so specific limits on distancing that you're putting in place — you should not do so.""

He warned that environmental health and bylaw officers would be out checking banquet halls and other places that hold events to ensure the 50-person capacity limit is being respected.

""They can expect to be visited,"" he said of those hosting private events. ""The rules will be enforced and that will have consequences.""

Dix's comments come as B.C. reported 78 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the province's total to 4,274.

No new deaths were reported Thursday, leaving the province's total at 196.

People between the ages of 20 to 29 now make up the group seeing the largest increase of infections, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said.

Those infections have been seen after exposure events, such as parties where young adults have been gathering, she added.

Henry said those in that age range as well as people between the ages of 30 to 39 make up a disproportionate number of the province's infections.

But she cautioned against criticizing the behaviour of all younger people.

""I think we have to be a little bit careful about demonizing. Most young people are doing the right things and they are socially responsible and they care a tremendous amount about their communities and their families. We have to be a little bit careful about tarring everybody with the same brush,"" she said.

Henry also revealed some of the responses to the B.C. COVID-19 Population Healthy Survey, laying out the toll the pandemic has had on people of different ethnic and racial backgrounds.

One in 10 adult British Columbians completed the survey, which asked questions regarding the financial and societal impact the pandemic had taken.

Those who identified as West Asian, Latin American and South Asian respondents were the most likely to report difficulties in meeting financial needs. West Asian, Latin American and Black respondents were the most likely to report job losses caused by the pandemic.

Caucasian respondents reported less financial difficulties and faced less job losses.

Those with lower incomes also reported issues with food security as well as a difficulty in meeting their financial needs.

In total, 1,878 people are self-isolating, including those who have been told to self-isolate as a result of potential exposure to the disease.

No new deaths were reported on August 13, leaving the province's death toll from the virus that has caused a global pandemic at 196.

Henry said 78 new cases of the coronavirus had been identified in the past 24 hours, and that younger people are increasingly those infected.

""We have to be a little bit careful about demonizing [others],"" Henry said. ""Most young people are doing the right thing and they are socially responsible. They care a tremendous amount about their communities and their families.""

The median age of the 550 people who have so far been hospitalized with the virus remains in the high 60s, Henry pointed out.

""Hospitalizations are very rare in young people and even in young adults,"" she said. ""We have had very few people who required ICU care and we've had no deaths in anybody under the age of 40. The deaths unfortunately are heavily skewed to the older population, particularly people over the age of 80.""

• 2,242 in Fraser Health (up 39);

• 150 in Island Health (no change);

• 398 in Interior Health (up four);

• 106 in Northern Health (up two); and

• 72 people who reside outside Canada (no change).

There are 3,500 people who have fully recovered from COVID-19 in B.C.

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby; and

BRITISH COLUMBIA

British Columbia has laid out its plan for studies to resume in ""learning groups"" this fall. School districts are to post final back-to-school details online by Aug. 26.

Back to class: Schools were initially scheduled to welcome students back full time on Sept. 8, but the province announced it is pushing back the restart date by two days to Sept. 10.

Groups: Students will be sorted into learning groups to reduce the number of people they come in contact with. For elementary and middle school students, groups will be no larger than 60 people. Secondary school groups will be capped at 120.

Physical distancing: Students and staff don't need to maintain physical distancing within their learning group, but contact should be minimized. Outside the group, physical distancing is required. Students should be more spaced out in classrooms.

Masks: Students and staff will not be required to wear masks in schools, but the province says it's a ""personal choice that will always be respected."" It says provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry recommends non-medical masks be worn by adults and older students when they are unable to physically distance like in hallways and on buses.

New routines: The province is urging schools to stagger recess, lunch and class transition times and take students outside whenever possible.

Transportation: Middle and high school students are asked to wear masks on buses. Students should be assigned seats, and a transparent barrier may be used to separate the driver.

ALBERTA

The province is planning to fully reopen schools from kindergarten to Grade 12 this fall. Measures will be tightened if an outbreak occurs and class sizes could be reduced to 20.

Back to class: School will be back in session with extra safety measures, but the province says there are programs to support remote and alternative learning.

Groups: Schools should sort students into cohorts by class when possible to minimize contact with others.

Physical distancing: Physical distancing is recommended when possible. Rooms should be rearranged to increase space between desks.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for staff and many students in some school settings. Students in Grades 4 to 12 must wear masks in all common areas, such as hallways and on buses. Staff are required to wear masks whenever physical distancing cannot be maintained. Mask use will be optional for kids in kindergarten through Grade 3. The government says all students and staff will receive two reusable masks as part of the policy.

Transportation: Parents are asked to bring their children to school if they can. Students who take the bus will sit in the same seat every day.

New routines: Schools are advised to consider a ""no sharing policy,"" with each student bringing their own supplies. Class, lunch and recess schedules will be staggered.

SASKATCHEWAN

Saskatchewan first unveiled a set of back-to-school guidelines in June, but released more details Aug. 4.

Back to class: Students will return to class as early as Sept. 1.

Groups: Groups of students and staff members assigned to them should stick together throughout the day and try not to mingle with other groups. Schools should aim to minimize the number of different instructors who interact with students throughout the day.

Physical distancing: Officials say maintaining physical distance is ""less practical"" for younger children, and the focus should be on limiting physical contact. Officials suggest limiting hugs and hand holding and suggest using alternative greetings such as air high fives. Schools are also to have dedicated quarantine areas where symptomatic students can go before they are picked up by parents.

Masks: The province says it's up to school boards to decide whether to make masks mandatory for students and staff. The chief medical health officer advises Grade 4 to 12 students should wear them in busy areas such as hallways and on buses.

Transportation: Parents should take their kids to school when possible, and pickup and drop-offs should happen outside. Students using school transportation should be assigned seats, and a partition may be used to separate the driver.

New routines: Start times, recess, lunch and class transitions may be staggered to allow for more space for physical distancing. Schools should rearrange their classrooms to space out students. Students and staff are asked to bring hand sanitizer.

---

MANITOBA

The Manitoba government says students are going back to the classroom on Sept. 8 with new guidelines.

Back to class: All students from kindergarten to Grade 8 are to have in-class instruction five days a week. High school students will also be in class full time, however, there may be some days of remote learning.

Groups: When physical distancing isn't possible, students will have to be organized into cohorts of no more than 75, and minimize contact with others. In these cases, there must be at least one metre between their desks.

Physical distancing: The province says students are required to maintain a two-metre distance to ""the greatest extent possible."" When it isn't possible, physical barriers may be an option. Spaces should be arranged to encourage separation.

Masks: Masks are strongly recommended for students in Grades 5 to 12. They are required when taking the bus.

Transportation: Masks are required for students Grade 5 and up, as well as drivers, on buses. Parents are encouraged to transport their children to school if they can.

New routines: Lunch and recess are to be staggered to minimize congestion, and in many cases teachers will change classrooms instead of students.

ONTARIO

Ontario students will be back in class September, but their schedules and class sizes may vary depending on where they live.

Back to class: Elementary students and many high schoolers will be in school five days a week in standard class sizes. However, secondary students at two dozen boards that are higher risk will only attend class half the time, and will spend the rest of the week working on ""curriculum-linked independent work."" Parents will also have the option to keep their kids out of class, and boards must provide options for remote learning.

Groups: For high schoolers in high-risk districts, class sizes will be capped at 15. Meanwhile, elementary students won't be broken up into smaller groups, but will be grouped into cohorts and their exposure to different teachers will be limited.

Physical distancing: While Education Minister Stephen Lecce said the aim is to keep students one metre apart from each other, a guidance document says only that schools should promote ""as much distancing as possible"" rather than being strictly enforced.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 through 12, and will be strongly encouraged for younger kids when they're in indoor common areas. Staff will be expected to wear masks.

Transportation: Some school boards may have more than one student assigned to a seat. When physical distancing isn't possible, masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 to 12, and younger students will be encouraged but not required to do the same.

New routines: Students in some districts will have to pre-register for in-person schooling. Some schools may limit or even ban visitors, including parents. Breaks will be scheduled to allow students to wash their hands.

---

QUEBEC

All elementary and high school students in Quebec will be required to attend class in September unless they have a doctor's note indicating they're at high risk of COVID-19 complications or they live with someone at risk. Those students will be allowed to study remotely.

Back to class: Class attendance is mandatory for elementary and high school students. For Grades 10 and 11, schools have the option of alternating schedules where students attend one day out of every two — as long as schools cannot maintain stable classroom bubbles. Grade 10 and 11 students are encouraged to attend classes as much as possible.

Groups: Each classroom will be its own bubble and students will not be required to maintain a two-metre distance between classmates.

Physical distancing: Students will need to keep a two-metre distance from all school staff, as well as all other students outside their classroom bubble. There are no physical distancing requirements for children or teachers in pre-school.

Masks: All students in Grade 5 and up — as well as all school staff — must wear a mask inside all common areas of the school except the classroom. Masks can also be removed when students are eating.

Transportation: No more than 48 students will be allowed on a school bus, with no more than two students sitting on the same bench. Preschool and elementary school students are strongly encouraged to wear masks, while older students are required to wear them.

New routines: When schools return in the fall, teachers will move from classroom to classroom, but students will stay put.

Backup plans: In the event of an outbreak in one class, the entire classroom bubble will be sent home to continue studies remotely. Authorities are also putting together an emergency protocol in the event of a second wave to ensure instruction continues online if entire schools are again forced to close. Ideas include quickly distributing tablets or laptops to students needing them and establishing a digital platform to continue courses and maintain communication.

NEW BRUNSWICK

The province has outlined a set of requirements schools must follow in developing their plans for the fall.

Back to class: Students in kindergarten to Grade 8 are to attend school full time, while those in Grades 9 to 12 are to be taught using a combination of in-class and remote instruction. At-home course work can include online learning, guided projects and experiential education.

Groups: For kindergarten through Grade 2, group sizes will be reduced to about 15, wherever possible. Group sizes should also be shrunk for Grades 3 to 5. Grades 6 to 8 will resume at regular class sizes. Students in Grades 9 to 12 will not be grouped because of their schedules and course options.

Physical distance: Grade 9 to 12 classrooms are required to maintain a one-metre distance, while a two-metre distance is recommended in common areas at all grade levels.

Masks: All students will be required to bring a mask to school, but masks will not be mandatory inside the classroom. Students in Grade 6-12 must wear masks on the school bus and in common areas of school buildings, while children in kindergarten to Grade 5 are encouraged to do so. Teachers for kindergarten to Grade 8 can choose whether they want to wear a mask or shield in the classroom while teachers for Grades 9-12 will be required to wear one when they cannot physically distance from students.

Transportation: Curtains will be installed inside school buses to separate drivers from students. If physical distancing is not possible, drivers will be required to wear a mask or face shield. Students must sit in the same seat every day. Students in kindergarten to Grade 5 will sit alone or with a member of their household. Students in Grades 6-12 wearing masks will sit two to a seat, and if they are sitting alone or with a member of their household, they do not have to wear a mask.

New routines: Arrivals, breaks and lunches are to be staggered. Public access to school buildings will be limited, and students, staff and visitors may also be subject to screening. High school students will be expected to have their own laptop or similar device, and some subsidies will be available. Drinking fountains will be replaced with water bottle-filling stations.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND

Schools on the Island are preparing to welcome all students back to class, while drafting backup plans for remote studies if required.

Back to class: Schools are to reopen for teachers and staff on Sept. 1 and for students on Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be organized into cohorts when possible and limit their exposure to others.

Physical distancing: Students will be taught about the importance of physical distancing, and extra teaching and cleaning staff may be hired. Schools are also asked to reduce class sizes as much as possible, reconfigure classrooms and make use of spaces such as libraries and multipurpose rooms.

Masks: The province says all staff and students in Grades 7-12 are ""strongly recommended"" to wear masks when physical distancing cannot be maintained. Students from kindergarten through Grade 6 may wear masks when physical distancing is impossible. Staff interacting with children who have complex medical needs are strongly recommended to wear face shields and gloves.

Transportation: Parents are asked to take their kids to school whenever possible. To reduce the number of riders on buses, schools may add vehicles and routes or implement walk-to-school programs. It is strongly recommended that all students and drivers wear masks on the bus.

New routines: P.E.I. education authorities are revising curricula for this school year to make up for learning gaps caused by lockdown constraints. Schools will stagger schedules to minimize congestion. The provincial school food program will be expanded next year in keeping with public health precautions. Elementary school students will stay in their classrooms for lunch.

NOVA SCOTIA

Education Minister Zach Churchill says the province's objective is for schools to return to 100 per cent capacity in the fall, but its plan includes measures to address the possible onset of a second wave of COVID-19.

Back to class: The province aims to have all elementary and high school students in classrooms by Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be asked to keep to cohorts.

Physical distancing: Students and staff will be encouraged to maintain a two-metre distance whenever possible. Lecture rooms will be reorganized to increase space between desks.

Masks: Masks are not required in classrooms, but students and staff may choose to wear them. While it's recommended that they bring their own, masks will be provided to those who don't have one. Staff and students in Grades 10 to 12 must wear masks when physical distancing is difficult.

Transportation: Students who take the school bus will be required to wear non-medical masks.

New routines: Only students and staff will be permitted to enter school buildings. When possible, teachers will be asked to move their classes outdoors. Students will be asked to bring their own computers to school, and the province says it has acquired an additional 14,000 devices for those with limited access to technology.

Backup plans: If a COVID-19 outbreak occurs during the academic year, schools will move to a blended learning model with smaller class sizes and home learning for older students.

---

NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR

The province's back-to-school plan aims to maximize in-class attendance with the option of a return to remote learning if the COVID-19 risk increases.

Back to class: The province's plan outlines three scenarios — in-class instruction, remote learning or a combination of both, depending on the COVID-19 risk in a particular community.

Groups: Cohorting by class is recommended when it's feasible, but students' schedules shouldn't be disrupted to support smaller groupings.

Physical distancing: Schools should aim to create a two-metre distance between desks, or as much distance as possible. However, provincial authorities say these precautions should not interfere with the daily school routine, and strict physical distancing should not be ""over-emphasized"" to children, because it is not practical and can cause psychological harm.

Masks: The province does not recommend masks for children, but says their use should not be ""stigmatized"" for those that choose to wear them. Staff will not be required to wear masks if physical distancing is possible.

Transportation: It will be up to school districts to determine their transportation operations, considering precautions such as assigning seats and separating the driver with a physical divider.

New routines: All students must bring their own supplies in keeping with a ""no sharing"" policy.

Backup plans: In the event of moderate-to-widespread transmission of COVID-19, school districts will move to online learning. Classroom attendance should be limited to about 50 per cent when the COVID-19 risk in a community is considered low to moderate. Newfoundland and Labrador says it will spend $20 million to purchase laptops for teachers and students in Grades 7 through 12 to support remote learning.

YUKON

The territorial government says it's making plans for the next school year that include flexibility around the number of students in classes if there's a second wave of COVID-19 or increased risk of transmission. It says each school will determine how it will adjust its operations to meet those guidelines, and school principals and staff are expected to share that information prior to September.

Back to class: Preliminary plans indicate that in rural communities, all students will return to school full time. In Whitehorse, however, kids in kindergarten through Grade 9 will return to full-day in-school instruction, while Grades 10 to 12 will spend half their day in the classroom, and the rest learning remotely.

Groups: Class sizes may be smaller to meet safety restrictions.

Masks: Wearing masks is a personal choice.

Transportation: Bus school and schedules will be posted to the territory's website.

New routines: Schedule shakeups may mean that some students won't have their regular teacher or the same classmates. School meal programs may be adapted with new safety measures and pickup options.

Backup plans: The territory has outlined a spectrum of school options if the risk to the community increases, ranging from rotating schedules to suspension of face-to-face learning.

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES

All N.W.T. schools have submitted plans to reopen their doors this fall. The territory says education authorities are taking a flexible approach in their planning to account for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall.

Back to class: While plans will vary from school to school, the territory will offer in-person instruction whenever possible, while ensuring alternative options are available.

Groups: Students in kindergarten through Grade 6 will be in classroom ""bubbles,"" and won't have to practise physical distancing within these groups.

Physical distancing: For Grades 7 to 9, students are asked to maintain a one-metre distance from each other, and two-metre distance from staff. Grade 10 to 12 students are asked to allow for two metres of distance from their peers and instructors.

Masks: Students of all ages may be required to wear masks in situations where physical distance cannot be practised, such as moving through the hallways.

Transportation: There may be changes to bus schedules, and all riders will be required to wear masks.

New routines: More time will be spent learning outside. School hours and schedules may also look different. Students are asked to label personal items and not share.

Backup plans: The territory says schools are preparing to shift between in-person, distance and blended learning at short notice should there become active COVID-19 cases.

---

NUNAVUT

The territory has released a four-stage plan for reopening schools based on the risk of the novel coronavirus in a community.

Back to class: There are no reported COVID-19 cases in Nunavut, so all schools are set to reopen this fall with enhanced cleaning and safety precautions.

Groups: It is recommended that schools cohort students by class and limit mixing as much as possible.

Physical distancing: Distance requirements will depend on what stage a community is in, and will primarily be achieved by limiting school attendance.

Masks: In most cases, the use of masks is not recommended for children. If there are exceptions, parents will be notified, and masks will be provided.

Transportation: As it stands, bus schedules are set to resume. Students older than 13 may be required to wear masks.

New routines: Group activities will be limited. Students won't be allowed to share food in lunchrooms.

Backup plans: The territory says schools could go part-time if contact tracing were to identify a possible source of COVID-19. All schools would be closed if community transmission were to take place.

The researchers found that 54 per cent of parents planned to vaccinate their children — up 16 percentage points from the previous year.

The study determined parents were more likely to get their child the flu shot if they thought there was potential for the child to catch COVID-19, and if their child was already up-to-date on other vaccinations.

Dr. Ran Goldman, the study's lead author, notes that public health officials around the world are concerned about the potentially harmful combination of COVID-19 and flu season.

In a phone interview with The Canadian Press, Goldman says immunizing children will be ""critical"" in protecting the population from both infections.

He said his team was ""very encouraged"" by the results of the study, but still would like to see a slightly higher proportion of parents willing to give their children the flu shot.

Goldman said the magic threshold for a vaccine to be highly effective is about 70 per cent.

Although he believes that goal can be reached, Goldman said the media and the scientific community must work harder to help dispel myths and disinformation about vaccine use.

""Vaccination is the world’s greatest public health achievement,"" Goldman said, stressing the impact vaccines have had on global mortality rates over the last century.

“While we are not at the same critical levels of PPE supply that we experienced a few months ago, it is concerning that a significant majority of continuing care organizations are concerned about their ability to maintain adequate PPE levels in the coming months,” says Jen Lyle, CEO, SafeCare BC. “Organizations should be focussed on providing great care, not worrying whether they will run out of PPE. This means the sector and government need to continue working together to ensure adequate levels of PPE for all healthcare workers.”

In response to the critical shortage of PPE, SafeCare BC launched its Operation Protect initiative, which in four months collected more than 1.2 million items of PPE from generous individuals and businesses. In addition, we sourced out new suppliers of PPE for our members. But the supply of donated PPE cannot be sustained, as the pandemic continues.

But what if the parents are separated or divorced and disagree on whether to send junior back to school or not? What happens then?

To find out more, The Chief caught up with Chantal Cattermole, a senior family lawyer with Vancouver firm Clark Wilson LLP.

What follows is an edited version of that conversation.

Q: If parents have an agreed-upon parenting regime — like a court order or an agreement — but looking at back to school during COVID-19, one parent wants to homeschool and the other wants the kids back in the classroom, what happens then?

A: If they can't negotiate something between them or with a mediator, then it is for the courts to decide. It is always about looking at the best interest of the child. The parents have to evaluate that. Does the child have specific health concerns that would make them compromised if they were going back? If there are, and one parent doesn't want to send him or her back, I think there would have to be third party evidence confirming that the child can't go back. Often, when it is health-related, you would need third party evidence to speak to why or why not the child could go back.

Q: How do you know what is in the best interest of the child? That is likely what both parents think they are doing.

A: Is your child immunocompromised to the point you would weigh that above the educational and social aspects of school or are the social and educational aspects greater or more important than the potential risk?

Maybe the child isn't immunocompromised and maybe it is just a parent who has some recognizable and fair concerns about the child returning to school with the current plan. You have to weigh those concerns with the other concerns, which would be, the child would not be educated [the same] or have access to the same programs. If the parents can't agree, they would have to consider going to the courts, mediation, or arbitration.

If the child is with the parent who doesn't want to send him to school when school starts, and the parent refuses to send him, the other parent may have to get an order compelling the child to attend school or compelling the child to return to their home and attend school with them.

Q: These are decisions that would have to be reached by the courts quickly, though, and the justice system seems to move slowly, so what is the timeline?

A: You would have to make an urgent application to the court. It is not appropriate for your child to miss out on an education, so the parent would have to make immediate arrangements to get some distance learning materials.

If you were the one applying for the child to not go to school, and you were making that application, you are going to need third party evidence with that application that supports your request.

If the courts say the child has to go, then the child has to go back.

If junior is refusing to go, and/or a parent is refusing to send them, then the police will be called, and junior will attend with the police. And it can go further and maybe the Ministry of Children and Family Development is called and the child is removed and taken to the other parent's home. It becomes a horrific mess.

Q: Back to the best interest of the child, at what age do kids have a say in whether they go back to school, or not?

A: I don't think the child really gets to have a say until they are of legal age to do so, which is 16 for schooling.

Q: And of course, there are costs associated with this legal process?

A: Yes. If you don't have a lawyer, you would pay the filing fees associated with bringing an application, if you have an existing claim. If you don't have an existing claim and you are filing a claim right away, you would likely file in provincial court and there would be a filing fee associated with that.

For legal fees, there are pro bono (without charge) programs available. Some law firms have them, as we do. If the firm doesn't then the person could apply for legal aid.

Q: With COVID-19, are you seeing a lot of parents coming to lawyers to change agreements?

A: Not so much, because I think it is still up in the air. I think people are still bumbling along, trying to figure out what is going to happen with COVID. At the early onset, in March and April, we had a lot where parents were trying to not participate in the regular parenting schedule, and saying that the other house was compromised, that kind of thing.

At the early stages, there was a lot of withholding of parenting time between people. But the court held first in Ontario and then in B.C. saying that unless there are specific reasons, they should abide by the parenting schedule and the houses should follow COVID-19 safety plans.

I haven't seen long-term agreements being changed.

We are all still living in this unknown land."

Addressing nervous parents in School District 43 and elsewhere, BC Teachers’ Federation president Teri Mooring counsels patience.

“We all have to take a deep breath and be patient and let that planning take time to occur.”

With a month to go before school starts, Mooring said planning is well underway with steering committees and working groups developing plans for back to school.

Mooring was one of the first critics of B.C.’s back-to-school plan in July, calling out the province for lack of consultation on cohort groups of 60 and 120 and seeking a phased in re-start.

But with Wednesday’s announcement that students won’t be back in class until Sept. 10 for orientation with school staff meeting Sept. 8 to firm up plans with their health and safety committees, Mooring is more optimistic about the direction schools, including 70 facilities in School District 43, will be taking.

That’s not to say she doesn’t have concerns.

Large school districts, such as School District 43, B.C.’s third largest, were facing crowded conditions before the pandemic, bringing in portables to stem the overflow.

Now, with COVID-19 requiring two metres of separation, how will classes of 30 students, the legislated maximum for Grades 4-12, keep people apart?

“We see a need for class density to be reduced so physical distancing is able to occur.”

That could mean some creative thinking for spreading out larger classes and Mooring said some districts may have to find available space.

Could that mean holding a class in a school gym?

“Districts will need to look at that,” Mooring said. “It’s not the same everywhere. We need to do our best.”

Within cohort groups of 60 staff and students at elementary and 120 at secondary contact will be avoided but a “a two-metre physical distance does not need to be maintained,” according to detailed information provided by the province.

However, Mooring says she’s looking forward to see what steering and working committees dealing with the plan will come up with on classroom formation.

Another issue is the availability and use of personal protective equipment.

Mooring said the province is making masks and face shields available for teachers and masks for students but it’s not clear when they should be worn, Mooring said, other than in situations where physical distancing can’t be maintained.

“We know they’re required on buses and hallways currently, but we think more needs to be done in that regard.”

With more information coming from the federal government on mask wearing for children, Mooring hopes the protocols can be fine-tuned.

In the meantime, with a month to go before school re-opens, she’s optimistic there is time to get all the details in place.

“We need to put together a plan that is really solid.”"

Staff will meet with schools’ health-and-safety committees beginning Sept. 8 to give staff the time to adjust to new routines and finalize lesson plans.

“We arrived at the two days after discussions with all the leaders of all the major partner groups in B.C.,” Fleming said on Wednesday. “This is the best scenario, I think, to continue to build the confidence and familiarity with the protocols that are in place.”

He said outdoor education will play a large role in the first two months of classes and emphasized the importance of students returning to schools to continue their education.

“We can’t sacrifice 18 months of education — we have to learn how to do things safely during this pandemic,” Fleming said. “That’s why we’ve developed and evolved the guidelines to maximize the return to in-class instruction.”

He acknowledged that some parents will not feel comfortable sending their kids back to school and the province’s distributed learning centres would help those who have concerns.

School districts will individually set the hours of the first two days back in school, Fleming added.

Premier John Horgan said he understands the concerns some people have about reopening schools.

“I absolutely get that there is anxiety in the community,” he said. “It’s not just about K-12 — for many people it’s extremely difficult and filling them with anxiety to go to the grocery store to get their basic needs filled on a weekly basis.

“We are in a global pandemic, we need to be cautious, we need to be aware. We don’t want to be fearmongers, but we want people to recognize that there is no immunity at this point in time, there is no vaccine at this point in time.”

Measures such as physical-distancing, frequent hand-washing and limiting contacts remain important, Horgan said. “That sounds counter to opening up our K-12 system but we, unlike every other jurisdiction in North America, have the benefit of a month of activity in June that has allowed us to shape what we believe the fall can look like,” he said. “We have taken a pause to allow educators to get into the schools and prepare for the first two days of the school year.”

Going back to school is a memorable occasion each September, Horgan said.

“This is an extraordinary time,” he said of life during the pandemic. “Our children are going to be extraordinary because of this time we’re living in.”

Horgan said adjustments will be made “as required” during the school year, while recognizing that every school and every district are different.

“As I’ve said repeatedly, what’s needed in Salmon Arm is not the same as what’s needed in Saanich or Salmo in the Kootenays.”

Greater Victoria Teachers’ Association president Winona Waldron was pleased with the prospect of more lead time for teachers but said she is disappointed that only two days have been allocated. More time is needed for “walk-through planning” to acclimate teachers to new ways of doing things, she said.

She suggested having more preparation time at elementary schools during the first week, along with a staggered start for the students.

Secondary schools should have their openings delayed for a week, Waldron said. “They’re going to have to rework the whole schedule.”

She said the system that sees secondary students attend four classes per semester won’t work in the current situation because they would come in contact with too many people.

“The teachers need an opportunity see how that looks,” she said.

In-person learning in B.C. was called off March 17 due to COVID-19. Optional, part-time school openings were offered in June, in part to give the province a dry run for restarting classes in September.

The government is spending $45.6 million on safety measures, including increased cleaning of high-contact surfaces, an increased number of hand-hygiene stations and boosting the availability of masks.

A government steering committee, established to help schools plan their restart, will issue operational guidelines next week on issues ranging from health and safety protocols to supporting the mental health of students.

Students will be organized into “cohorts” to reduce the number of people they come in contact with. The learning groups will be made up of about 60 people in elementary and middle schools, and about 120 in secondary schools.

Because it takes time to correct a credit score error, waiting until you ""need"" your high credit score is a risky move, she says.
So I would encourage people to check their credit report and make sure that everything on there looks right.""","TORONTO — Hundreds of thousands of Canadians have been negotiating with lenders over the past few months, hoping to hold off paying debt amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Now, those payments are beginning to filter through the credit reporting system.

article continues below

""We have seen the average number of accounts that are in a payment deferral status triple since before the pandemic,"" says Eva Wong, co-founder and chief operating officer of Borrowell, which offers free credit scores and reports.

""It shouldn't impact the credit score, but it should show up on the credit report.""

The Canadian Bankers Association said that as of June 30, 760,000 account holders had negotiated mortgage deferrals or skipped payments, while 445,000 had requested deferral for credit card debt.

According to Equifax, deferred payments — many agreed to as part of COVID-19 relief programs — don't harm borrowers' credit scores. But the payments must be reported in a certain way, and the status of these payments may not get reported to Equifax for up to 30 days.

It's important to make sure these deferred payments are reported correctly to credit bureaus, because even one false late payment can drop a credit score by as much as 150 points, says Wong. Credit scores are used not only by lenders, but also checked by cellphone carriers, employers and landlords, Wong says. Because it takes time to correct a credit score error, waiting until you ""need"" your high credit score is a risky move, she says.

""Depending on the type of error, the longer it persists, the more negative the impact,"" says Wong. ""If it's showing up as a late payment and it goes to month two, then it's two months of missed payments as opposed to just one. So I would encourage people to check their credit report and make sure that everything on there looks right.""

Anne Arbour, a financial educator at the Credit Counselling Society in Toronto, says that Canada's two credit-reporting agencies, Equifax Canada and TransUnion Canada, are data aggregators, and it is up to the lenders to create policies on how they report the deferred payments. It's important for consumers to get clear documentation of their agreement with their lender — such as a bank — when it comes to how they are reporting deferred payments, she says.

""Get as much detail from the lender, from the creditor, as possible about what a deferral will mean and what their practices as far as reporting it — so, whether it will impact somebody's rating or their score or not,"" says Arbour. ""And if there is any issue or concern, deal with the creditor first, getting as much written information as possible.""

Arbour noted that deferrals are not an automatic license to skip payments — not only must a formal agreement be struck, but many lenders may have explicit instructions on how interest or even late fees accrues while payments are halted.

Taylor Little, chief of Vancouver-based alternative lender, Neighbourhood Holdings, says that many people skipped payments based on reading about deferral programs, without actually checking to make sure whether the lender was offering deferrals or some other type of payment plan instead. Doing that can hurt a credit score, and likely won't be counted as an error, he says.

When checking with lenders, Arbour says people should collect a copy of the agreement, a file ID or reference number, and the name of the agent with whom they spoke, in case this information is needed to file a credit score dispute down the road.

If a consumer notices something that might be wrong on their credit score —such as a deferred payment being counted as ""late"" — the lender is once again the first stop, she says.

""Going back to the creditor themselves is a good first step,"" she says. ""[Equifax and TransUnion] have worked closely with the Canadian Bankers Association, with the lenders, everybody to try and come up with a way to report any deferrals, whether it was mortgages or credit cards, in a way that wouldn't penalize the consumer. But the onus ultimately was on and is on the creditors to change their systems.""

In addition to requesting a fix from the lender, consumers can ask Equifax or TransUnion to investigate a mismarked payment, through a credit report update form or investigation request form. Separately, consumers can also now put a ""consumer statement"" to a credit report to signal to lenders that something is being disputed. Equifax Canada gives an example: ""Be advised that the negative accounts on my credit report are related to the Covid-19 pandemic. I intend to make these up as soon as I can find a job.""

Keeping on top of errors — and being quick to correct them if they happen — is easier if consumers stick with a routine and understand the parts of the credit scoring process, says Arbour. For example, free services that offer credit monitoring offer more frequent updates and are different from Equifax or TransUnion's free yearly reports. Those annual reports from Equifax or TransUnion are also different from the formal scores checked by lenders in a ""hard"" credit check, she says.

She advised that consumers can take advantage of both credit monitoring services and free yearly reports.

""There's no sort of one size fits all answer — very often mortgages don't actually appear on credit reports,"" says Arbour. ""[Mismarked deferrals] haven't been brought up as a concern just yet. . . . I think come September, it might be a different story. Once deferrals are over, unless people are checking their credit report, they won't notice it unless they're in a situation where they're having to renew their term or renegotiate a rate or a debt management program.""

Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau announced Thursday that the government has signed eight agreements worth nearly $50 million to help align the needs of food banks and other community groups with what farmers and producers can supply.

article continues below

In an interview with The Canadian Press, Bibeau called the program a ""win-win-win.""

""It's reaching three objectives,"" she said.

""The first one to feed the people in need, second to support our farmers by buying some of their surplus at the cost of production and the third one was avoiding food waste.""

The organizations receiving the money include Food Banks Canada, Second Harvest and the Quebec group La Tablee des Chefs.

Altogether, approximately 12 million kilograms of everything from fish to fowl will be purchased from food producers and then redistributed under the $50-million food surplus program announced by the Liberals earlier this year.

The near shutdown of the hospitality industry has meant a sharp decline in the number of places to sell perishable foods.

That has led to litres of milk being dumped down drains, potatoes going bad in storage and farmers facing higher costs to hold on to animals they had nowhere to sell if slaughtered.

At the same time, food banks have reported sharp increases in the number of people seeking assistance, having lost their jobs due to the pandemic, and there were calls for the federal government to find a way to match up the two.

Lori Nikkel, the chief executive officer at Second Harvest, said pre-pandemic, an estimated 58 per cent of all the food produced for Canadians was going to waste.

That number was definitely pushed higher by COVID-19, she said, and she applauded the federal government's leadership in spooling up the program.

Second Harvest uses an online platform, FoodRescue.ca, to link up organizations that need food for their programs with farmers and producers who have surplus goods.

They received $11 million from the government to expand that program to include paying producers directly for their food, and ensure the groups on the receiving end have what they need to process, distribute and store it.

Nikkel said the money will go fast, and she hopes the federal government will consider a new round of funding at a later date as the need will not go away.

""The commodities are going to change,"" she said.

""Who we are helping now may not be the people we are helping tomorrow.""

Bibeau said the government will keep an eye on whether the demand from organizations, and oversupply from producers, remains in the coming months.

""We'll keep the door open in the sense that for now, we feel it's a very worthwhile program, and we look forward to seeing how it will evolve in the coming weeks.""

Ten per cent of the product being purchased by the surplus program is being sent to northern communities.

Among the projects focused on those is one with Fisher River Cree Nation in Manitoba, which received $10.8 million to catch millions of kilograms of walleye and redistribute the fish to more than 75 Indigenous communities.

Now, as someone who is often in the public eye for my work with Victoria’s homeless plus my earlier work at Monday magazine, you may think I’m used to being a target for online abuse.

But the truth is, passion makes one vulnerable. And I’m not alone in this. I also work alongside hundreds of compassionate people who work on the frontlines of two simultaneous pandemics (opioid poisoning and COVID-19) and expose their hearts every single day.

In a time when we should be coming closer together, when we should be looking at the exposed cracks in our society and working on solutions, too many people are eager to grab the keyboard and spew hate into the mix.

Recently, for example, I was told that I should “be fired” and “go back to Scotland” because I work with people experiencing poverty, homelessness, mental health struggles and opioid dependency. It is clearly hate speech, and I’m seeing it more and more.

“Go back to where you came from,” is the last gasp cry for racists who lack the intellect to rally for solutions.

Instead of wasting our energy disseminating hate, isn’t it possible to rise above it and look at our problems through fresh eyes?

There is passion in that hatred and fear, but it’s being wasted. And what the toxic online world is teaching us is that wasting time and energy attacking strangers and neighbours is perfectly normal.

It isn’t.

So let’s do something positive. Instead of being divided, let’s unite. Whether you work for a non-profit or local businesses, live in a downtown condo or a sea-view home, we all want the same thing: to see people given access to housing, treatment, and the dignity of not living in a park.

Let’s write to our MPs and our MLAs and say it is time for a national strategy to deal with the severe mental health issues that are leaving people to die on our streets. Our current solution is not working. We need a multi-pronged program that includes care facilities, supported care homes, and the compassionate professionals necessary to actually make changes in people’s lives.

I know a young woman in her 20s who smokes crystal meth to deal with the voices that swirl in her brain from schizophrenia. She lives in a transitional home and performs sex work to pay for her drugs.

All we’re doing at the moment is watching her slowly die. That is not good enough. If she were to be placed into a compassionate mental-health program, away from drugs and under professional care, there is a chance she could find a new lease on life.

Instead, she’s treated as disposable.

I want us all to do better, and the first step is looking deep into our own hearts, swallow down that knee-jerk reaction to spout hate, and rally for the good of all people.

Come on, Victoria, I believe in you."

Premier John Horgan announced Wednesday that 500 more health-care workers are being hired to do contact-tracing after patients test positive for the virus.

Dr. Bonnie Henry and others have warned for months that pandemics often come in at least two surges. The scale of hiring for the contact- tracing effort and the timing suggest it is more than just a precautionary move.

It would hike the number of staff now available to do that work by 70 per cent. The move was announced just two hours before the latest daily count showed 85 new cases, the highest tally since March 23. There are now 531 active cases in B.C., up from 160 on July 1.

Last month, Health Minister Adrian Dix outlined the resources in that field. He said there were 697 staff in the health authorities around B.C. who were considered available to do such work if needed and 264 were engaged in doing so as of mid-July. He advised at the time that the $30 million in extra costs could go higher if more are needed.

Now the Provincial Health Authority is hiring 500 more temporary staff.

Horgan said they are expected to be retired health-care professionals who can be deployed around the province in teams, starting in September.

Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, said contact tracing is “exceedingly important” in the COVID-19 pandemic. There’s no way yet to cure victims, and the only way to control the spread is to limit exposure and track people who have been exposed to get them isolated. Self-isolation is mandatory under a health order and about 1,700 people are currently undergoing it. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control states 3,300 people have done so since the coronavirus arrived.

The process has been underway since the first case in January. So far, on average, it identifies an estimated 98 per cent of individual carriers’ contacts. Henry said they track all contacts confidentially and monitor people continuously over the two-week incubation period to check their symptoms and also their adherence to the self-isolation requirement.

Henry said the mass hiring will ensure B.C. is prepared “if there is a surge of cases in the coming months.”

“We need to keep going for the next few months, maybe even years until there is an effective vaccine.”

The workload increased significantly in recent months. B.C.’s daily cases ebbed through May and June then started increasing in July and has stayed higher through August. The restart of the economy involved relaxing some restrictions that allowed social circles to broaden. So contact tracers are chasing more cases, and the cases have more contacts than previously.

The higher summer caseload might also suggest a surge in the fall. In early spring, officials, including Henry, discussed expectations that the virus might subside during the hot summer months. But it rampaged through some hot southern American states over that time and also increased in B.C., although hospitalization and fatality rates remain low.

Officials are still congratulating British Columbians for their efforts to curtail the virus, but there was renewed emphasis on condemning poor practices that could spread it.

Horgan said: “The good behaviour, the common sense of British Columbians, is not consistent across the board.” He said in cases where people are flaunting restrictions, “We’re going to be looking hard at enforcement when it comes to situations like that.”

There was also a suggestion that the new mass hiring is related to more stringent monitoring and enforcement of social distancing.

Horgan said the government needs to get the message out to the audience that’s not hearing it. “Taking pressure off contract tracers will allow us to redeploy resources to get to that objective.”

Wednesday’s case count of 85 is just short of the record daily total of 91 on March 25. If it firms up into a trend, that fall surge will have begun sooner than expected and the crackdown will be coming sooner rather than later.

BRITISH COLUMBIA

British Columbia has laid out its plan for studies to resume in ""learning groups"" this fall. School districts are to post final back-to-school details online by Aug. 26.

Back to class: Schools were initially scheduled to welcome students back full time on Sept. 8, but the province announced it is pushing back the restart date by two days to Sept. 10.

Groups: Students will be sorted into learning groups to reduce the number of people they come in contact with. For elementary and middle school students, groups will be no larger than 60 people. Secondary school groups will be capped at 120.

Physical distancing: Students and staff don't need to maintain physical distancing within their learning group, but contact should be minimized. Outside the group, physical distancing is required. Students should be more spaced out in classrooms.

Masks: Students and staff will not be required to wear masks in schools, but the province says it's a ""personal choice that will always be respected."" It says provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry recommends non-medical masks be worn by adults and older students when they are unable to physically distance like in hallways and on buses.

New routines: The province is urging schools to stagger recess, lunch and class transition times and take students outside whenever possible.

Transportation: Middle and high school students are asked to wear masks on buses. Students should be assigned seats, and a transparent barrier may be used to separate the driver.

---

ALBERTA

The province is planning to fully reopen schools from kindergarten to Grade 12 this fall. Measures will be tightened if an outbreak occurs and class sizes could be reduced to 20.

Back to class: School will be back in session with extra safety measures, but the province says there are programs to support remote and alternative learning.

Groups: Schools should sort students into cohorts by class when possible to minimize contact with others.

Physical distancing: Physical distancing is recommended when possible. Rooms should be rearranged to increase space between desks.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for staff and many students in some school settings. Students in Grades 4 to 12 must wear masks in all common areas, such as hallways and on buses. Staff are required to wear masks whenever physical distancing cannot be maintained. Mask use will be optional for kids in kindergarten through Grade 3. The government says all students and staff will receive two reusable masks as part of the policy.

Transportation: Parents are asked to bring their children to school if they can. Students who take the bus will sit in the same seat every day.

New routines: Schools are advised to consider a ""no sharing policy,"" with each student bringing their own supplies. Class, lunch and recess schedules will be staggered.

---

SASKATCHEWAN

Saskatchewan first unveiled a set of back-to-school guidelines in June, but released more details Aug. 4.

Back to class: Students will return to class as early as Sept. 1.

Groups: Groups of students and staff members assigned to them should stick together throughout the day and try not to mingle with other groups. Schools should aim to minimize the number of different instructors who interact with students throughout the day.

Physical distancing: Officials say maintaining physical distance is ""less practical"" for younger children, and the focus should be on limiting physical contact. Officials suggest limiting hugs and hand holding and suggest using alternative greetings such as air high fives. Schools are also to have dedicated quarantine areas where symptomatic students can go before they are picked up by parents.

Masks: The province says it's up to school boards to decide whether to make masks mandatory for students and staff. The chief medical health officer advises Grade 4 to 12 students should wear them in busy areas such as hallways and on buses.

Transportation: Parents should take their kids to school when possible, and pickup and drop-offs should happen outside. Students using school transportation should be assigned seats, and a partition may be used to separate the driver.

New routines: Start times, recess, lunch and class transitions may be staggered to allow for more space for physical distancing. Schools should rearrange their classrooms to space out students. Students and staff are asked to bring hand sanitizer.

---

MANITOBA

The Manitoba government says most students are to be back in classrooms on Sept. 8 with new guidelines to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Back to class: All students from kindergarten to Grade 8 are to have in-class instruction five days a week. High school students will also be in class full time, except in schools where there is inadequate space for physical distancing, in which case there will be some days of remote learning.

Groups: When physical distancing isn't possible, students will have to be organized into cohorts no larger than 75, and minimize contact with others. In these cases, there must be at least one metre between their desks.

Physical distancing: The province says students are required to maintain a two-metre distance to ""the greatest extent possible."" When it isn't possible, physical barriers may be an option. Spaces should be arranged to encourage separation.

Masks: Masks are not required for students or staff.

Transportation: Buses will be running at reduced capacity, and parents will be asked to transport their children to school if they can.

New routines: Lunch and recess are to be staggered to minimize congestion, and in many cases teachers will change classrooms instead of students.

ONTARIO

Ontario students will be back in class September, but their schedules and class sizes may vary depending on where they live.

Back to class: Elementary students and many high schoolers will be in school five days a week in standard class sizes. However, secondary students at two dozen boards that are higher risk will only attend class half the time, and will spend the rest of the week working on ""curriculum-linked independent work."" Parents will also have the option to keep their kids out of class, and boards must provide options for remote learning.

Groups: For high schoolers in high-risk districts, class sizes will be capped at 15. Meanwhile, elementary students won't be broken up into smaller groups, but will be grouped into cohorts and their exposure to different teachers will be limited.

Physical distancing: While Education Minister Stephen Lecce said the aim is to keep students one metre apart from each other, a guidance document says only that schools should promote ""as much distancing as possible"" rather than being strictly enforced.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 through 12, and will be strongly encouraged for younger kids when they're in indoor common areas. Staff will be expected to wear masks.

Transportation: Some school boards may have more than one student assigned to a seat. When physical distancing isn't possible, masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 to 12, and younger students will be encouraged but not required to do the same.

New routines: Students in some districts will have to pre-register for in-person schooling. Some schools may limit or even ban visitors, including parents. Breaks will be scheduled to allow students to wash their hands.

---

QUEBEC

All elementary and high school students in Quebec will be required to attend class in September unless they have a doctor's note indicating they're at high risk of COVID-19 complications or they live with someone at risk. Those students will be allowed to study remotely.

Back to class: Class attendance is mandatory for elementary and high school students. For Grades 10 and 11, schools have the option of alternating schedules where students attend one day out of every two — as long as schools cannot maintain stable classroom bubbles. Grade 10 and 11 students are encouraged to attend classes as much as possible.

Groups: Each classroom will be its own bubble and students will not be required to maintain a two-metre distance between classmates.

Physical distancing: Students will need to keep a two-metre distance from all school staff, as well as all other students outside their classroom bubble. There are no physical distancing requirements for children or teachers in pre-school.

Masks: All students in Grade 5 and up — as well as all school staff — must wear a mask inside all common areas of the school except the classroom. Masks can also be removed when students are eating.

Transportation: No more than 48 students will be allowed on a school bus, with no more than two students sitting on the same bench. Preschool and elementary school students are strongly encouraged to wear masks, while older students are required to wear them.

New routines: When schools return in the fall, teachers will move from classroom to classroom, but students will stay put.

Backup plans: In the event of an outbreak in one class, the entire classroom bubble will be sent home to continue studies remotely. Authorities are also putting together an emergency protocol in the event of a second wave to ensure instruction continues online if entire schools are again forced to close. Ideas include quickly distributing tablets or laptops to students needing them and establishing a digital platform to continue courses and maintain communication.

NEW BRUNSWICK

The province has outlined a set of requirements schools must follow in developing their plans for the fall.

Back to class: Students in kindergarten to Grade 8 are to attend school full time, while those in Grades 9 to 12 are to be taught using a combination of in-class and remote instruction. At-home course work can include online learning, guided projects and experiential education.

Groups: For kindergarten through Grade 2, group sizes will be reduced to about 15, wherever possible. Group sizes should also be shrunk for Grades 3 to 5. Grades 6 to 8 will resume at regular class sizes. Students in Grades 9 to 12 will not be grouped because of their schedules and course options.

Physical distance: Grade 9 to 12 classrooms are required to maintain a one-metre distance, while a two-metre distance is recommended in common areas at all grade levels.

Masks: It's unclear where the province stands on staff and students wearing masks.

Transportation: The province says it's working with school districts to develop plans for transportation. Pickup and drop-off schedules may be staggered.

New routines: Arrivals, breaks and lunches are to be staggered. Public access to school buildings will be limited, and students, staff and visitors may also be subject to screening. High school students will be expected to have their own laptop or similar device, and some subsidies will be available.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND

Schools on the Island are preparing to welcome all students back to class, while drafting backup plans for remote studies if required.

Back to class: Schools are to reopen for teachers and staff on Sept. 1 and for students on Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be organized into cohorts when possible and limit their exposure to others.

Physical distancing: Students will be taught about the importance of physical distancing, and extra teaching and cleaning staff may be hired. Schools are also asked to reduce class sizes as much as possible, reconfigure classrooms and make use of spaces such as libraries and multipurpose rooms.

Masks: The province says all staff and students in Grades 7-12 are ""strongly recommended"" to wear masks when physical distancing cannot be maintained. Students from kindergarten through Grade 6 may wear masks when physical distancing is impossible. Staff interacting with children who have complex medical needs are strongly recommended to wear face shields and gloves.

Transportation: Parents are asked to take their kids to school whenever possible. To reduce the number of riders on buses, schools may add vehicles and routes or implement walk-to-school programs. It is strongly recommended that all students and drivers wear masks on the bus.

New routines: P.E.I. education authorities are revising curricula for this school year to make up for learning gaps caused by lockdown constraints. Schools will stagger schedules to minimize congestion. The provincial school food program will be expanded next year in keeping with public health precautions. Elementary school students will stay in their classrooms for lunch.

NOVA SCOTIA

Education Minister Zach Churchill says the province's objective is for schools to return to 100 per cent capacity in the fall, but its plan includes measures to address the possible onset of a second wave of COVID-19.

Back to class: The province aims to have all elementary and high school students in classrooms by Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be asked to keep to cohorts.

Physical distancing: Students and staff will be encouraged to maintain a two-metre distance whenever possible. Lecture rooms will be reorganized to increase space between desks.

Masks: Masks are not required in classrooms, but students and staff may choose to wear them. While it's recommended that they bring their own, masks will be provided to those who don't have one. Staff and students in Grades 10 to 12 must wear masks when physical distancing is difficult.

Transportation: Students who take the school bus will be required to wear non-medical masks.

New routines: Only students and staff will be permitted to enter school buildings. When possible, teachers will be asked to move their classes outdoors. Students will be asked to bring their own computers to school, and the province says it has acquired an additional 14,000 devices for those with limited access to technology.

Backup plans: If a COVID-19 outbreak occurs during the academic year, schools will move to a blended learning model with smaller class sizes and home learning for older students.

---

NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR

The province's back-to-school plan aims to maximize in-class attendance with the option of a return to remote learning if the COVID-19 risk increases.

Back to class: The province's plan outlines three scenarios — in-class instruction, remote learning or a combination of both, depending on the COVID-19 risk in a particular community.

Groups: Cohorting by class is recommended when it's feasible, but students' schedules shouldn't be disrupted to support smaller groupings.

Physical distancing: Schools should aim to create a two-metre distance between desks, or as much distance as possible. However, provincial authorities say these precautions should not interfere with the daily school routine, and strict physical distancing should not be ""over-emphasized"" to children, because it is not practical and can cause psychological harm.

Masks: The province does not recommend masks for children, but says their use should not be ""stigmatized"" for those that choose to wear them. Staff will not be required to wear masks if physical distancing is possible.

Transportation: It will be up to school districts to determine their transportation operations, considering precautions such as assigning seats and separating the driver with a physical divider.

New routines: All students must bring their own supplies in keeping with a ""no sharing"" policy.

Backup plans: In the event of moderate-to-widespread transmission of COVID-19, school districts will move to online learning. Classroom attendance should be limited to about 50 per cent when the COVID-19 risk in a community is considered low to moderate. Newfoundland and Labrador says it will spend $20 million to purchase laptops for teachers and students in Grades 7 through 12 to support remote learning.

YUKON

The territorial government says it's making plans for the next school year that include flexibility around the number of students in classes if there's a second wave of COVID-19 or increased risk of transmission. It says each school will determine how it will adjust its operations to meet those guidelines, and school principals and staff are expected to share that information prior to September.

Back to class: Preliminary plans indicate that in rural communities, all students will return to school full time. In Whitehorse, however, kids in kindergarten through Grade 9 will return to full-day in-school instruction, while Grades 10 to 12 will spend half their day in the classroom, and the rest learning remotely.

Groups: Class sizes may be smaller to meet safety restrictions.

Masks: Wearing masks is a personal choice.

Transportation: Bus school and schedules will be posted to the territory's website.

New routines: Schedule shakeups may mean that some students won't have their regular teacher or the same classmates. School meal programs may be adapted with new safety measures and pickup options.

Backup plans: The territory has outlined a spectrum of school options if the risk to the community increases, ranging from rotating schedules to suspension of face-to-face learning.

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES

All N.W.T. schools have submitted plans to reopen their doors this fall. The territory says education authorities are taking a flexible approach in their planning to account for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall.

Back to class: While plans will vary from school to school, the territory will offer in-person instruction whenever possible, while ensuring alternative options are available.

Groups: Students in kindergarten through Grade 6 will be in classroom ""bubbles,"" and won't have to practise physical distancing within these groups.

Physical distancing: For Grades 7 to 9, students are asked to maintain a one-metre distance from each other, and two-metre distance from staff. Grade 10 to 12 students are asked to allow for two metres of distance from their peers and instructors.

Masks: Students of all ages may be required to wear masks in situations where physical distance cannot be practised, such as moving through the hallways.

Transportation: There may be changes to bus schedules, and all riders will be required to wear masks.

New routines: More time will be spent learning outside. School hours and schedules may also look different. Students are asked to label personal items and not share.

Backup plans: The territory says schools are preparing to shift between in-person, distance and blended learning at short notice should there become active COVID-19 cases.

---

NUNAVUT

The territory has released a four-stage plan for reopening schools based on the risk of the novel coronavirus in a community.

Back to class: There are no reported COVID-19 cases in Nunavut, so all schools are set to reopen this fall with enhanced cleaning and safety precautions.

Groups: It is recommended that schools cohort students by class and limit mixing as much as possible.

Physical distancing: Distance requirements will depend on what stage a community is in, and will primarily be achieved by limiting school attendance.

Masks: In most cases, the use of masks is not recommended for children. If there are exceptions, parents will be notified, and masks will be provided.

Transportation: As it stands, bus schedules are set to resume. Students older than 13 may be required to wear masks.

New routines: Group activities will be limited. Students won't be allowed to share food in lunchrooms.

Backup plans: The territory says schools could go part-time if contact tracing were to identify a possible source of COVID-19. All schools would be closed if community transmission were to take place.

In a press conference before the day’s new COVID-19 cases were released, Horgan said if private house parties continue to contribute to the growing caseload in the province, enforcement will follow suit, with warnings escalating into more severe penalties.

“If people continue to work around, or try and disregard the rules that the rest of British Columbians are following, then we will, of course, take action,” he said.

That’s the stick.

The carrot? Home-grown celebrities.

“My number is on the Internet,” quipped Horgan as he called on such Vancouver-raised actors as Ryan Reynolds and Seth Rogen to help communicate health and safety guidelines to young people via social media.

“This is a call out to Deadpool right now,"" he said. “Ryan, we need your help out here, get in touch with us.”

Neither actor has yet to comment on Horgan’s call through their Twitter channels, though both often lend their voices, if virtually, to causes in the city.

“This is bread and butter work for public health,” said Dr. Henry, adding, the new positions will “make sure that we’re prepared if there’s a surge in the coming weeks.”

The announcement comes a day after the province reported more active COVID-19 cases than at any time in the last three months. The additional new 46 cases announced yesterday surpassed that of Ontario for the first time in months, an ominous reversal even as fatalities caused by COVID-19 have not been recorded for over a week.

Dr. Henry said public health officials are using social network analysis to track social contacts with overlapping social circles in multiple parties. That kind of tool has helped track people attending multiple parties as well as the second generation spillover into other places in the province.

Premier John Horgan had stern words for those in the province that aren’t taking public health’s COVID-19 guidelines seriously.

“The good behaviour, the common sense of British Columbians is not consistent across the board,” said Horgan. “We’re going to be looking hard at enforcement.”

Horgan said if private house parties continue to contribute to the growing caseload in the province, enforcement will follow suit, with warnings escalating into more severe penalties.

“If people continue to work around, or try and disregard the rules that he rest of British Columbians are following, then we will of course take action,” he said.

On a lighter note, Horgan also called on such Vancouver-raised actors as Ryan Reynolds and Seth Rogen to help communicate health and safety guidelines to young people via social media.

There are already some positive signs that the message is getting through. Dr. Henry said the number of people going in for testing has increased across the province, and among younger people, the percentage of positive cases is increasing.

In a Facebook post, management of the bar said the exposure relates to one customer who later tested positive for the coronavirus and that, so far, “all of our staff members have stayed healthy.”

The second exposure occurred at Charlie Hamiltons Pub at 1031-1163 Pinetree Way (facing Lincoln Avenue) on Aug 4 from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.

In both cases, the health authority is warning the public through its new exposure portal, a step it triggers when contact tracers are “unable to reach or identify all potentially exposed via contact tracing.”

However, if you were at either location during the times and dates indicated, it does not necessarily mean you’ll develop the symptoms of COVID-19.

Anyone who visited the the two bars are asked to monitor themselves for symptoms.

“If you develop any symptoms of COVID-19, please seek testing and then self-isolate. Please call ahead and wear a mask when seeking testing,” notes Fraser Health.

The Tri-City News has attempted to reach both businesses but has not yet received a reply. But according to promotional material on both bars' social media channels — and an Aug. 10 recorded voice message on Charlie Hamiltons Pub's voice mail — they appear to have remained open in the intervening time.

In its Facebook post, The Taphouse Coquitlam wrote it had not received information about the exposures until recently.

“It is important to mention that we wish this information was shared with us sooner, so we could have shared it with you sooner,” wrote management. “Regardless of this, we are doing everything in our power to trace any possible exposure to our guests and staff members.""

Fraser Health advises that there is no risk to anyone who attended either of the establishments outside the flagged dates and times.

The Tri-Cities' latest publically acknowledged exposures come amidst a steady stream of new infections across B.C. In an ominous reversal Tuesday, Aug. 11, B.C. reported more new cases than Ontario (46 versus 33). At 472 infections, the province now has the highest number of active COVID-19 cases in three months.

Baumbusch is concerned that these families who typically use health care services are struggling on alone and may be facing additional challenges.

For example, they might not be able to work if they are providing nursing care for their children.

“People are drowning, this has been going on how many months — for four or five with no end in sight. A lot of people who might have had registered nurses or support in their home and had to stop that because of concerns for their children’s health.”

Also, party buses - now?","If you are wondering how party buses are still on Vancouver's streets in the middle of a pandemic, you are not alone.

Despite strict guidelines outlining the maximum allowable number of people in many stores, clubs, and restaurants, the rules are decidedly murky about how many people may occupy a vehicle.

article continues below

WorkSafeBC Media Spokesperson Ivy Yuen tells Vancouver Is Awesome in an email that guidance to employers in the transportation sector during the pandemic includes a hierarchy of controls.

""The first level of protection is physical distance, which may include occupancy limits or rearranging work spaces. If physical distancing is not possible, other levels of protection include installing barriers, such as Plexiglass, implementing rigorous cleaning and disinfecting practices, and personal protective equipment, such as masks,' writes Yuen.

That said, Yuen also notes that it is up to employers to assess the risks to workers and implement measures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 in the workplace.

To assist employers with the COVID-19 Safety Plan, WorkSafeBC has developed safety protocols for the transportation sector during the pandemic. However, the agency notes that the nature of this sector can make it difficult to exercise adequate physical distancing, particularly in smaller vehicles. And while employers are expected to limit the number of customers, a party bus can hold as many as 35 people.

Some of the companies that V.I.A. reached out to said that they have 35 to 30 person party buses, but that they are reducing the number of passengers to ensure physical distancing. However, in some cases, as many as 25 people could still be booked on a 30 person bus. With the total number of passengers reduced by a mere five individuals, it is difficult to imagine that there could be adequate physical distance between bus occupants.

In addition, many party bus companies do not require that passengers wear masks.

For restaurants, WorkSafeBC guidelines clearly state that no more than six persons may occupy a table. When it comes to the transportation sector, there is no specific number. As such, the maximum number of allowable occupants for a given vehicle may vary significantly depending on what the employer feels is appropriate.

Here are some of things people are saying on social media about party buses operating in B.C. during the pandemic.

Thank you for being an intelligent person! People like you (& me) will help us all get through this pandemic by following Dr Henry's rules.

The announcement Tuesday by Russian President Vladimir Putin that his country was the first to approve a coronavirus vaccine did not provoke the awe and wonder of the Soviet Union’s launch of the first satellite into orbit in 1957. Instead, it was met by doubts about the science and safety.

But the claim underscored how, like the space race, the competition to have the first vaccine is about international rivalries as well as science. The first nation to develop a way to defeat the novel coronavirus will achieve a kind of moonshot victory and the global status that goes along with it.

That's valuable to Putin, whose popularity at home has declined amid a stagnant economy and the ravages of the virus outbreak.

""To be the first one out of the block with a coronavirus vaccine would be a real — pardon the pun — shot in the arm for the Kremlin,"" said Timothy Frye, a political science professor at Columbia University who specializes in post-Soviet politics.

Russia is not alone in viewing a vaccine in this light. China, where the virus first emerged, has also raced to make progress on a vaccine. A state-owned Chinese company is boasting that its employees, including top executives, received experimental shots even before the government approved testing in people.

President Donald Trump, whose handling of the coronavirus pandemic has put his political fate in grave jeopardy, is hoping to get credit for his administration’s aggressive push for a vaccine, ideally one that arrives before Election Day in November.

It's far from clear at this point whether Putin has beaten Trump to this medical milestone.

Putin said the Health Ministry gave its approval after the vaccine, named ""Sputnik V,"" underwent the necessary tests. he said one of his two adult daughters had been inoculated. ""We should be grateful to those who have taken this first step, which is very important for our country and the whole world,"" he said.

No proof was offered and scientists in Russia warned that more testing would be necessary to establish it is safe and effective. Nonetheless, officials said vaccination of doctors could start as early as this month and mass vaccination may begin as early as October.

Scientists around the world have been cautioning that even if vaccine candidates are proven to work, it will take even more time to tell how long the protection will last.

""It’s a too early stage to truly assess whether it’s going to be effective, whether it’s going to work or not,"" said Dr. Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton.

It was also too soon to dismiss the Russian claim out of hand.

The country, though economically dependent on the export of natural resources, does have a history of achievement in science, medicine and aerospace — including becoming the first to put a person into space, in 1961.

""It is possible that they concentrated and could do this,"" said Daniel Fried, a retired senior U.S. diplomat. ""I’m not scoffing at it, but it doesn’t mean that the Russian economy is advanced.""

A vaccine would be the kind of significant achievement that would elevate Putin at home and in the international community.

""They would love to be able to claim credit because the first country to develop the vaccine will gain enormous prestige,"" said Fried, a former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs who is now a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council.

It’s also possible Russia had help. The U.S., Britain and Canada l ast month accused hackers working for Russian intelligence of trying to steal information about a coronavirus vaccine from academic and pharmaceutical research institutions.

In any case, the public is eager for a vaccine as global deaths from the virus surpass 730,000. Some say they would even welcome one from Russia, provided it passes muster with the Food and Drug Administration, which approves vaccines used in the U.S., and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends who should receive them.

""I can’t take it anymore. I’m getting crazy,"" said Fernanda Henderson, as she strapped her infant into a car seat at a park in the Maryland suburbs of Washington for a break from quarantining at home. ""I don’t think the CDC or the FDA would approve something that is not going to work.""

But to Vesna Jezic, a 79-year-old native of Croatia and immunologist who was taking her grandchildren to the same park, the suspiciously fast progress on the vaccine announced by Putin was reason to be doubtful. ""You can imagine we don’t trust anything that comes from Russia,"" she said.

The Russian president may face similar doubts at home. Frye noted a 2018 Gallup Poll that showed the former Soviet countries have some of the highest rates of anti-vaccination sentiment in the world.

""If it turns out not to work, it would be a real black eye,"" he said.

The Singapore biotech company Tychan Pte Ltd. also is testing an antibody drug and has similar products in development for Zika virus and yellow fever.
All the antibody drugs are given through an IV and must make their way through the bloodstream to wherever they’re needed.","With a coronavirus vaccine still months off, companies are rushing to test what may be the next best thing: drugs that deliver antibodies to fight the virus right away, without having to train the immune system to make them.

Antibodies are proteins the body makes when an infection occurs; they attach to a virus and help it be eliminated. Vaccines work by tricking the body into thinking there’s an infection so it makes antibodies and remembers how to do that if the real bug turns up.

article continues below

But it can take a month or two after vaccination or infection for the most effective antibodies to form. The experimental drugs shortcut that process by giving concentrated versions of specific ones that worked best against the coronavirus in lab and animal tests.

""A vaccine takes time to work, to force the development of antibodies. But when you give an antibody, you get immediate protection,"" said University of North Carolina virologist Dr. Myron Cohen. ""If we can generate them in large concentrations, in big vats in an antibody factory ... we can kind of bypass the immune system.""

These drugs are believed to last for a month or more and could give quick, temporary immunity to people at high risk of infection, such as health workers and housemates of someone with COVID-19. If they proved effective and if a vaccine doesn't materialize or protect as hoped, the drugs might eventually be considered for wider use, perhaps for teachers or other groups.

They’re also being tested as treatments, to help the immune system and prevent severe symptoms or death.

""The hope there is to target people who are in the first week of their illness and that we can treat them with the antibody and prevent them from getting sick,"" said Dr. Marshall Lyon, an infectious disease specialist helping to test one such drug at Emory University in Atlanta.

Having such a tool ""would be a really momentous thing in our fight against COVID,"" Cohen said.

Vaccines are seen as a key to controlling the virus, which has been confirmed to have infected more than 20 million people worldwide and killed more than 738,000. Several companies are racing to develop vaccines, but the results of the large final tests needed to evaluate them are months away.

The antibody drugs are ""very promising"" and, in contrast, could be available ""fairly soon,"" said Dr. Janet Woodcock, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration official who is leading government efforts to speed COVID-19 therapies. Key studies are underway and some answers should come by early fall.

One company, Eli Lilly, has already started manufacturing its antibody drug, betting that studies now underway will give positive results.

""Our goal is to get something out as soon as possible"" and to have hundreds of thousands of doses ready by fall, said Lilly’s chief scientific officer, Dr. Daniel Skovronsky.

Another company that developed an antibody drug cocktail against Ebola — Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. — now is testing one for coronavirus.

""The success with our Ebola program gives us some confidence that we can potentially do this again,"" said Christos Kyratsous, a Regeneron microbiologist who helped lead that work.

Regeneron’s drug uses two antibodies to enhance chances the drug will work even if the virus evolves to evade action by one.

Lilly is testing two different, single-antibody drugs — one with the Canadian company AbCellera and another with a Chinese company, Junshi Biosciences. In July, Junshi said no safety concerns emerged in 40 healthy people who tried it and that larger studies were getting underway.

Others working on antibody drugs include Amgen and Adaptive Biotechnologies. The Singapore biotech company Tychan Pte Ltd. also is testing an antibody drug and has similar products in development for Zika virus and yellow fever.

""I’m cautiously optimistic"" about the drugs, said the nation's top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci. ""I’m heartened by the experience that we had with Ebola,"" where the drugs proved effective.

What could go wrong?

— The antibodies may not reach all of the places in the body where they need to act, such as deep in the lungs. All the antibody drugs are given through an IV and must make their way through the bloodstream to wherever they’re needed.

— The virus might mutate to avoid the antibody — the reason Regeneron is testing a two-antibody combo that binds to the virus in different places to help prevent its escape.

Skovronsky said Lilly stuck with one antibody because manufacturing capacity would essentially be cut in half to make two, and ""you will have less doses available."" If a single antibody works, ""we can treat twice as many people,"" he said.

— The antibodies might not last long enough. If they fade within a month, it’s still OK for treatment since COVID-19 illness usually resolves in that time. But for prevention, it may not be practical to give infusions more often than every month or two.

A San Francisco company, Vir Biotechnology Inc., says it has engineered antibodies to last longer than they usually do to avoid this problem. GlaxoSmithKline has invested $250 million in Vir to test them.

Giving a higher dose also may help. If half of antibodies disappear after a month, ""if you give twice as much, you will have two months’ protection,"" Lilly’s Skovronsky said.

— The big fear: Antibodies may do the opposite of what’s hoped and actually enhance the virus’s ability to get into cells or stimulate the immune system in a way that makes people sicker. It’s a theoretical concern that hasn’t been seen in testing so far, but large, definitive experiments are needed to prove safety.

""As best as we can tell, the antibodies are helpful,"" Lyon said.

Education Minister Rob Fleming told reporters Tuesday that students wouldn't be expected back on the original date of Sept. 8 to help give administrators and teachers more time to prepare for education amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Wednesday, the ministry put out a media release saying staff will meet on Sept. 8, while students will be welcomed in classrooms by Sept. 10.

Fleming said the government and its steering committee are working to finalize how school operations will work. He said he expects operating guidelines for schools to be released next week.

“Having the restart week staged in some kind of manner that would have staff teams together for a couple days before we gradually welcome kids back to make sure that every school — all 1,500 of them in the province — are truly ready to welcome students is a good idea, and that’s the approach that we’ll be taking,” Fleming said.

In the past, students going back to class would return to their previous classrooms before moving to new ones, but he said that isn’t safe now.

“That obviously can’t happen under these pandemic conditions.”

The province said it would add $45.6 million to the B.C. COVID-19 Action Plan to help school districts and independent schools get started on the school year. The funds are for such things as better access to hand hygiene, more cleaning staff and opportunities for remote learning.

Students will be put into cohorts, or learning groups, made up of about 60 people in elementary and middle schools and about 120 in secondary school. People will interact primarily with members of their group while at school.

School administrators are currently looking at, or have started, changing the physical layout of classrooms and common areas to help students ensure social distancing is maintained, Fleming added.

The change in the start date comes after concerns were raised by the B.C. Teachers’ Federation and the B.C. Principals’ and Vice-Principals’ Association last week.

The federation called for more time to work on the return to school plan while the association for school administrators asked the government to consider a flexible classroom start date, depending on the readiness of each school.

Teri Mooring, president of the teachers’ federation, said she’s still looking for more details from the provincial government.

“The plans are still underway but there aren’t enough details and information right now for folks,” she said. “It’s understandable that there’s a high level of concern and stress about what it’ll look like in schools in September.”

Mooring emphasized that the safety of staff and students is the top priority.

Don Peterson, president of the Saanich Teachers’ Association, said that putting the start of the year off is a good step if teachers can get into the schools ahead of students.

“My biggest concern with the [back-to-school] plan is how are teachers going to be properly briefed,” he said.

Greater Victoria Teachers’ Association president Winona Waldron also likes the idea of a later school start in order to be more prepared.

“Clearly, there’s a task ahead for teachers and administrators to figure out how to set up these learning groups and to make sure that health-and-safety protocols are in place and that everybody’s familiar with what needs to be done — basically a walk-through before kids are back at school.”

Saanich School District superintendent Dave Eberwein said Tuesday afternoon that he hadn’t received anything official on the issue from the Ministry of Education.

“We’ll certainly take our direction from the ministry in terms of start-up and what they expect for that,” he said. “So if there is additional time for preparation, that’s always appreciated, and we’ll certainly make the best use of it.”

The announcement of a phased-in approach to returning to classrooms came as Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement on Tuesday that community transmission of COVID-19 affects schools.

“As we look to fall, what we’ve learned from other jurisdictions is that transmission in a school setting is a reflection of what’s happening in our communities; keeping our community transmission low and slow keeps us all safe.

“And behind the scenes, public health is using contact tracing to mitigate the new growth in cases.”

There were 46 new cases in the province on Tuesday for a total of 4,111.

The Ministry of Education previously announced that most students would be back in classes after Labour Day but several groups, including the BC Teachers’ Federation and the BC Principals and Vice-Principals Association (BCPVPA), asked for the start to be delayed.

“Previously students would come back into class, usually with their previous year's teachers, and wait a few days for school to be organized for the coming school year,” Fleming said in the legislature. “We can't do that in a pandemic. That would not be in compliance with the BCCDC guidelines.”

Darren Danyluk, president of the BCPVPA, told the Richmond News if students and staff all arrive on Sept. 8, they won’t necessarily have been briefed in COVID-19-related safety protocols.

He added it could prove to be “very challenging” if there is no time before Sept. 8 to plan how to restart school during a pandemic.

“If we don’t get together as a team beforehand, how do (teachers) know their tasks, their roles,” Danyluk said.

The Richmond District Parents Association (RDPA) president Dionne McFie said they’ve heard many families are concerned about sending their kids back on Sept. 8. in groups of 60 or 120 and many have said they’d like to see a hybrid model for learning as an option.

“From what I’ve heard, there’s not a lot of support for going back,” McFie told the News on Monday before the minister’s announcement.

Fleming said the announcement coming in a few days will outline what Sept. 8 will be like for support staff, administration and teachers to make sure students are “organized into the classes where they will be with their peers in a unit that is designed to limit the student interactions.”

“If that takes some extra time and builds additional confidence and fulfils the guidelines that have been developed by Dr. Bonnie Henry and her team, that's what we're going to do in the province of British Columbia,” he added."

As news emerged that Russia had approved the world's first such vaccine, Dr. Theresa Tam said she is as anxious as anyone for a safe and effective vaccine to be ready, but that getting one quickly doesn't mean compromising safety.

article continues below

""Getting this done in record time is no easy feat, as we must ensure any vaccine demonstrates the highest standard of safety and effectiveness,"" Tam said at a media briefing in Ottawa.

""There are many steps and partners across research, government and industry required to produce and deliver a safe and effective vaccine. All steps and partners are crucial. Nothing gets cut.""

Tam said for Canada, fast-tracking a vaccine means trying to do some things at the same time. That could mean while a vaccine candidate is still in its third and final clinical trial phase, governments are developing plans to produce, distribute and administer that vaccine if it gets approved.

Scientists both within Russia and outside it sounded alarm at the early approval of the Russian vaccine, which was developed by the Gamaleya Institute in Moscow and Russia's ministry of defence. Russia's health ministry claimed that the vaccine, which modifies a common cold virus to try and mimic the novel coronavirus, will make someone immune to COVID-19 for up to two years.

But Russian scientists have published no data on the evidence to back that up.

Tam would not comment on Russia's vaccine at all because she said she doesn't have enough information about it.

Her deputy, Dr. Howard Njoo, said there is just not much information available about how effective that vaccine has been, any side effects it had for the people it was tested on, or how many people were involved in those trials. He said one of the only indicators is the amount of time that passed between the discovery of the vaccine and the decision to approve it.

""It seems quite short, based on what we know about how normally vaccine trials go,"" Njoo said.

Vaccines normally go through at least three phases of testing, with very small numbers of volunteers receiving it in the first two phases. In phase three, the number of people it is tested on grows exponentially. At least two of the vaccine candidates being developed in the United States are testing their product on 30,000 healthy adults in phase three.

The Moscow vaccine appears to have been given approval before any phase three trial, citing enough success in the first two phases.

Tam warned last week that getting a vaccine approved won't be a ""silver bullet"" to stop the pandemic because approval is just the first step. She said Tuesday the success of any approved vaccine will depend heavily on getting Canadians to take it.

The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada surpassed the 120,000 mark Tuesday, with 8,987 deaths attributed to the disease. Tam says almost nine in 10 patients have already recovered.

There are more than two dozen COVID-19 vaccine candidates in various clinical testing phases around the world, and Tam said eight are in the third and final phase. Most companies behind those trials have said not to expect results until the fall.

Last week, Canada signed deals with two vaccine developers, Pfizer and Moderna, to get access to millions of doses of their experimental vaccines if they succeed at phase three trials and are approved by Health Canada. The earliest either is expected to arrive in Canada for use in patients is next winter.

Tam said she is ""cautiously optimistic"" a vaccine is coming and she has full confidence in Health Canada's approval process to ensure any vaccine Canadians are given is both safe and effective.

Back in June, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry shared graphic models of what the COVID-19 virus would do in BC if our social interactions rose over 60 per cent. The steeply rising number of new cases now looks a lot like the 70 to 80 per cent models we were shown two months ago, and that isn’t good news.

article continues below

There are a lot of reasons why BC may be starting to lose its grip on pandemic control. Some point to young people, or alcohol, or summer barbecues; others cite the lack of mask wearing, people not staying home when sick or not bothering to keep social circles small. Some blame tourists. Some argue that stress and fatigue are making us complacent. All of these may be true to varying degrees.

Simply put, the biggest challenge in the pandemic response might just be human nature. We are social beings, and limiting our human connections has been extremely difficult. Maybe not surprisingly, our local COVID-19 survey found that feeling disconnected from family and friends was reported as the biggest negative impact of the pandemic, more than worry, health or finances.

It seems only natural, then, that we would feel fearful or angry or simply tired of the threat and precautions that separate us. Given all the harms of social restrictions, it is also natural we would resist and test these limits.

As the risk appeared to fade, at least temporarily, our leaders knew they needed to help promote a new balance of isolation versus connections and commerce. Only time will tell if we have collectively found that balance, but we do know we will need to adapt and make changes if we haven’t.

Thankfully, we know what to do if cases continue to rise. We’ve seen how much we can reduce the spread of this virus when we diligently practice physical distancing, stay home when sick and wash our hands. Additionally, we now know masks (when used properly) can reduce virus transmission in situations where distancing isn’t possible. Finally, critically, we can now do testing (and contact tracing if positive) for anyone with potential symptoms of COVID-19.

Truly, we have the tools we need to help us manage this virus until we have a vaccine or effective therapy (likely many months away), but it requires the majority of us to make changes to our daily routines and behaviours. We need not be perfect in our efforts, but the more intentional and consistent we are as individuals and communities, the less likely we will see widespread closures again.

While it may be in our natures to be social, it is also our nature to look out for one another. Local residents who answered our survey overwhelmingly reported that they worry more about their loved ones getting sick than they do about themselves. Sometimes we are motivated to change not for ourselves, but for those around us.

So here we are. Fall is going to bring unique challenges to navigate during the pandemic, such as school reopening, more indoor time and influenza season. As a city and region, and as health-care workers, we hope to meet these challenges with clarity, care and compassion. And we hope to meet them together.

Be calm, be safe, and be kind.

Education Minister Rob Fleming announced on Tuesday that students wouldn't be returning to class as originally planned on Sept. 8.

He said the government was looking at a more gradual return with classes starting later in the second week of September.

The Montreal-based French language teacher, 34, was surfing the internet one day when she came across SOS Sitter, a service that connects groups of six or seven children with a caretaker by Zoom for around an hour. Looking for a way to keep her four-year-old son, Adam, occupied over long days in lockdown, she gave a few lessons a try and quickly becoming hooked.

Tanasyuk now has Adam enrolled in a few hours of virtual care each morning, time she relishes to get her own work done.

""When I'm working, he's busy too,"" Tanasyuk says.

She's one of many young Canadian parents finding solace in creative solutions to the sudden lack of childcare ushered in by COVID-19. Virtual babysitting is one of the solutions for working parents grappling with the double demands of a day job and parenting duties.

Though Tanasyuk's son is not yet old enough for kindergarten, she doesn't plan to send him to daycare any time soon because Quebec's daily coronavirus infection rate remain higher than she'd like. She's grateful to know she has other options that work, and plans to use SOS Sitter to keep her son busy for at least part of each workday.

As an only child, it lets Adam can socialize with other children and adults — which has been a strugle for many kids with no siblings during social isolation.

""He likes to listen to others,"" Tanasyuk says. ""[The lessons offer] a lot of conversation from every kid, and he likes to hear his name. He wants to hear his name, he wants a teacher to call him, ask him if everything is good.""

Everyday, Tanasyuk sits him in front of the computer with materials SOS Sitter childcare providers have instructed her to prep in advance such as books to read, crayons for craft-themed sessions, or comprehension tools for Spanish-language lessons. Adam prefers to take his courses alone, Tanasyuk says, so she lets him enjoy his time independently while she works from another room.

Since pivoting SOS Sitter's services online at the start of the pandemic, company founder Paulina Podgorska says she's heard from a number of parents who are grateful to have pockets of free time.

""For 40 minutes at a time, parents can be free of kids and can organize the time to have that important meeting, call the client, talk to the boss ... whatever they need,"" Podgorska says.

Her company currently offers group sessions at $12 per time-slot, with discounted rates for sessions bought in bulk, but she's working on orchestrating one-on-one sessions at a slightly higher fee.

Virtual care rates are slightly more affordable than traditional in-person babysitting, which typically hovers at around $15 an hour, primarily because the time and travel are cut from the equation, Podgorska says.

To Tanasyuk, the cost is worth it for parents who have the extra budget.

""I would recommend it,"" she says. ""It's an opportunity to continue to learn while being at home.""

Though it's too soon to say whether school reopenings across the country will affect demand for services like SOS Sitter, Podgorska remains hopeful that parents will continue to rely on virtual babysitting to break up evenings, weekends or days off.

""There are so many situations when [school is not necessarily] closed, but the child is at home today,"" Podgorska says. ""This service covers the need.""

Elize Shirdel, founder of Toronto-based virtual daycare platform HELM Life holds a similar views. She sees her service, which offers virtual daycare sessions for $9 each, as ""a component of a rounded childcare strategy.""

A working parent herself, Shirdel admits she was originally skeptical about increasing screen time for her children. But after realizing that time spent learning via computer has a far different effect on young minds than recreational activities, she eagerly recommends remote learning to other millennial parents.

""When I put my kids in front of YouTube, or Netflix ... that gets me back grouchy kids,"" Shirdel says. ""But when they do an online activity it's different. They spend a little while drawing and creating and talking and playing, then we get back happy kids.""

Podgorska, too, believes technology can be an advantageous learning tool; she recalls the early days of the pandemic, when SOS Sitter had just launched its online services. She was surprised to learn quickly that Zoom came intuitively to even young children.

""We were so new to this whole thing: I was new to the virtual babysitting, my teachers were new, parents were new, and kids were new,"" Podgorska says. ""Guess which one took [it] on the best and the quickest? The kids.""

""They are the foundation and the backstop for all of us,"" she says.

Reducing the numbers of people allowed on site, staggering start times and recess/lunch breaks, keeping groups small and using masks when appropriate are some of the measures that will be used in schools.

""It may be that two or three classes all start at the same time and have recess at the same time. It doesn't mean that all of those children will be intermingling every day. It means they may go for recess at the same time, but they'll be in different areas of the school yard.""

Outside classrooms will also be considered in efforts to increase ventilation and the capacity for physical distancing.

Masks will be used in contexts where physical distancing cannot be maintained, but if data on the transmission of COVID-19 in children and use of masks shows a need to adapt, that could change.

""To think of a young child, 10, 11, 12, sitting all day in a classroom with the mask on is probably not realistic,"" says Dr. Henry. ""There's lots of things that we can do to make those environment safe without requiring somebody to sit with a mask on for long periods of time.""

Grandparents involved in the care of a child, such as those who provide before or after-school care, should remain involved in the child's life following the school restart if the family feels it is safe, advised Dr. Henry.

However, she says although significant work is being done to ensure the safety of children, parents, families and teachers, she acknowledges the fear people may feel about the restart of in-class learning.

""This anxiety, this fear, this not knowing what it's going to look like in the face of a global pandemic, is perfectly normal. We are all feeling that, and I understand that.

""Schools will look different. We have to put aside what classes were like in March or even in June, and we learn from what we know about this virus and about how it spreads and about things that we can do around the world."""

The worldwide count of known COVID-19 infections climbed past 20 million on Monday, with more than half of them from just three countries: the U.S., India and Brazil, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.

The average number of new cases per day in the U.S. has declined in recent weeks but is still running high at over 54,000, versus almost 59,000 in India and nearly 44,000 in Brazil.

In other developments Tuesday:

— Russia became the first country to approve a vaccine against the virus. While a proven coronavirus vaccine would be an epic medical breakthrough, the move raised alarms among scientists because the shots have not been subjected to large-scale testing in humans. They have only been studied in dozens of people, not the thousands typically involved.

— The Big Ten and Pac-12 announced they won’t play football this fall because of the virus, taking two of college sports’ five powerhouse conferences out of the season. The Big Ten includes Ohio State, Michigan, Nebraska and Penn State, while the Pac-12 includes Arizona, Arizona State, UCLA, the University of Southern California, Oregon, Utah and Washington.

The severe and sustained crisis in the U.S. — over 5 million cases and 163,000 deaths, easily the highest totals of any country — has dismayed and surprised many around the world, given the nation’s vaunted scientific ingenuity and the head start it had over Europe and Asia to prepare.

South Africa, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Russia and the Philippines round out the list of the top 10 countries contributing the most new cases to the global tally since July 22, according to an Associated Press analysis of Johns Hopkins data through Monday.

The real number of people infected by the virus around the world is believed to be much higher — perhaps 10 times higher in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — given testing limitations and the many mild cases that have gone unreported or unrecognized.

Some of the worst-hit nations have been those whose leaders have downplayed the severity of COVID-19, undercut the advice of health experts and pushed unproven remedies.

President Donald Trump, Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, for example, all rarely wear masks and have resisted calls for strict lockdowns. Trump and Bolsonaro have promoted the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, even though studies have shown it to be useless against the virus, with potentially deadly side effects.

In the U.S., Mexico and Brazil, testing has been criticized as inadequate. While the U.S. has ramped up testing in recent months, Americans have faced discouragingly long lines and delays in getting the results. In Mexico, 47% of tests are coming back positive, suggesting that only seriously ill people are getting screened.

Contact tracing, which has helped authorities in other countries get a handle on the spread, has also been criticized as insufficient in all three countries.

The U.S., with about 4% of the world’s population, accounts for about 25% of the known coronavirus infections and 22% of the deaths.

Mexico has reported nearly 500,000 cases and more than 50,300 deaths, but the president’s point man on the epidemic, Assistant Health Secretary Hugo López-Gatell, said a full lockdown would prove too costly for people with little savings and tenuous daily incomes.

""We do not want a solution that would, in social terms, be more costly than the disease itself,"" he said.

Cases have begun to rise significantly in Caracas, Venezuela, perhaps one of the world’s least-prepared cities to face the pandemic.

The country has been under a lockdown since March, but limited testing, open defiance of quarantine measures and the return of tens of thousands of Venezuelan migrants from countries with higher caseloads have resulted in a steady expansion that is starting to overwhelm hospitals with scarce supplies.

""What has been successful in other countries is massive testing and isolating the population that is sick,"" said Domingo Subero, 66, an engineer worried about the situation in Caracas. ""Here, neither of those two things is happening.""

Elsewhere around the world, New Zealand, which has been praised for quickly getting the virus under control, reported the first cases of local transmission in the country in 102 days. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said four cases were discovered in a single Auckland household.

Ardern said Auckland, the nation's largest city, will be moved to Alert Level 3 from midday Wednesday through midnight Friday, meaning that people will be asked to stay at home, while bars and many other businesses will be closed.

""These three days will give us time to assess the situation, gather information, make sure we have widespread contact tracing so we can find out more about how this case arose and make decisions about how to respond to it once we have further information,"" Ardern said at a hastily called news conference late Tuesday.

""I know that this information will be very difficult to receive,"" Ardern said. ""We had all hoped not to find ourselves in this position again. But we had also prepared for it. And as a team, we have also been here before.""

She said that travelling into Auckland will be banned unless people live there and are travelling home.

She said the rest of the country will be raised to Level 2 through Friday, meaning that mass gatherings will be limited to 100 attendees and people would need to socially distance themselves from each other.

Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said the infections were confirmed after a person in their 50s went to their doctor on Monday with symptoms and was swabbed twice, testing positive both times. Six other people in the person's household were then tested, with three more positive results.

""Importantly, the person has no history of overseas travel,"" Bloomfield said, adding that the source of the infections remains unknown.

Until Tuesday, the only known cases of the virus in New Zealand were 22 travellers who had recently returned from abroad and were being held in quarantine at the border.

The country has been praised globally for its virus response.

New Zealand initially got rid of the virus by imposing a strict lockdown in late March when only about 100 people had tested positive for the disease. That stopped its spread.

Life had returned to normal for many people in the South Pacific nation of 5 million, as they attended rugby games at packed stadiums and sat down in bars and restaurants without fear of getting infected. But some had warned that the country had become complacent.

President Vladimir Putin announced the Health Ministry's approval and said one of his two adult daughters already was inoculated. He said the vaccine underwent the necessary tests and was shown to provide lasting immunity to the coronavirus, although Russian authorities have offered no proof to back up claims of safety or effectiveness.

""I know it has proven efficient and forms a stable immunity,"" Putin said. ""We must be grateful to those who made that first step very important for our country and the entire world.""

However, scientists in Russia and other countries sounded an alarm, saying that rushing to offer the vaccine before final-stage testing could backfire. What's called a Phase 3 trial — which involves tens of thousands of people and can take months — is the only way to prove if an experimental vaccine is safe and really works.

By comparison, vaccines entering final-stage testing in the U.S. require studies of 30,000 people each. Two vaccine candidates already have begun those huge studies, with three more set to get underway by fall.

""Fast-tracked approval will not make Russia the leader in the race, it will just expose consumers of the vaccine to unnecessary danger,"" said Russia’s Association of Clinical Trials Organizations, in urging government officials to postpone approving the vaccine without completed advanced trials.

While Russian officials have said large-scale production of the vaccine wasn't scheduled until September, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said vaccination of doctors could start as early as this month. Officials say they will be closely monitored after the injections. Mass vaccination may begin as early as October.

""We expect tens of thousands of volunteers to be vaccinated within the next months,"" Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund that bankrolled the vaccine, told reporters.

The vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Institute in Moscow with assistance from Russia's Defence Ministry uses a different virus -- the common cold-causing adenovirus -- that’s been modified to carry genes for the ""spike"" protein that coats the coronavirus, as a way to prime the body to recognize if a real COVID-19 infection comes along.

That’s a similar technology as vaccines being developed by China’s CanSino Biologics and Britain’s Oxford University and AstraZeneca — but unlike those companies, Russian scientists haven't published any scientific information about how the vaccine has performed in animal tests or in early-stage human studies.

Dmitriev said even as Russian doctors and teachers start getting vaccinated, advanced trials are set to start Wednesday that will involve ""several thousand people"" and span several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines and possibly Brazil.

The Associated Press couldn't find documentation in the Russian Health Ministry's records indicating that permission to start the advanced trials was granted. The ministry has not responded to a request for comment.

Putin said one of his daughters has received two doses, and had minor side effects such as slight fever, and is now ""feeling well and has a high number of antibodies."" It wasn't clear if she was one of the study volunteers.

The Health Ministry said in a statement Tuesday that the vaccine is expected to provide immunity from the coronavirus for up to two years, citing its experience with vaccines made with similar technology.

However, scientists around the world have been cautioning that even if vaccine candidates are proven to work, it will take even more time to tell how long the protection will last.

""The collateral damage from release of any vaccine that was less than safe and effective would exacerbate our current problems insurmountably,"" Imperial College London immunology professor Danny Altmann said in a statement Tuesday.

The World Health Organization has urged that all vaccine candidates go through full stages of testing before being rolled out, and said Tuesday it is in touch with the Russian scientists and ""looks forward to reviewing"" Russia’s study data. Experts have warned that vaccines that are not properly tested can cause harm in many ways — from harming health to creating a false sense of security or undermining trust in vaccinations.

Becoming the first country in the world to approve a vaccine was a matter of national prestige for the Kremlin as it tries to assert the image of Russia as a global power. Putin repeatedly praised Russia’s effective response to the outbreak in televised addresses to the nation, while some of Moscow’s top officials – including the country’s prime minister and Putin’s own spokesperson – became infected.

And the U.S., Britain and Canada last month accused Russia of using hackers to steal vaccine research from Western labs. Russia has denied involvement.

Russia has so far registered 897,599 coronavirus cases, including 15,131 deaths.

The Gamaleya Institute’s director, Alexander Gintsburg, raised eyebrows in May when he said that he and other researchers tried the vaccine on themselves before the start of human studies.

Those trials started June 17 with 76 volunteers. Half were injected with a vaccine in liquid form and the other half with a vaccine that came as soluble powder. Some in the first group were recruited from the military, which raised concerns that servicemen may have been pressured to participate. The test was declared completed earlier this month.

""It’s a too early stage to truly assess whether it’s going to be effective, whether it’s going to work or not,"" said Dr. Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at England's University of Southampton.

It's not Russia's first controversial vaccine. Putin has bragged that Russian scientists delivered an Ebola vaccine that ""proved to be the most effective in the world"" and ""made a real contribution to fighting the Ebola fever in Africa."" However, there is little evidence either of the two Ebola vaccines approved in Russia was widely used in Africa. As of 2019, both of those vaccines were listed by the WHO as ""candidate vaccines.""

""Our number of new cases is climbing, and it's climbing to levels that we haven't seen in a number of months,"" said B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix. ""The number of people now in self-isolation is disturbing. Though some increase was expected, each of us knows our numbers are too high.""

He urged people to stop going to private parties, as most of the new cases are related to large gatherings.

""We need to say 'enough' to private parties, where alcohol is being used and where physical distancing isn't possible,"" Dix said.

There have been two new outbreaks at long-term care homes – George Derby Centre and the New Vista Care Centre. That brings the number of long-term care homes with active cases – once whittled down to just three – to seven.

But there have been no deaths from COVID-19 for 10 consecutive days in B.C., and the number of people in hospital with the virus is down.

On a positive note, Henry said the province is having good success with contract tracing. Many of those who tested positive for the virus were notified because they were on a contract tracing list.

""The vast majority of the people who tested positive over the past three days were people who were on our contact list,"" Henry said. ""That means that, as they developed their illness, they were isolated and they no longer exposed others, breaking those chains of transmission.""

However, she added: ""We need to do better collectively to stop these exposure events from happening.""

With the resumption of school in the fall looming, Henry's office is under increasing pressure to require students to wear masks in class, when school resumes.

But Henry said it would be impractical to require students, especially younger children, to wear masks in class all day, and reiterated that it is the least effective of the measures that reduce the risk of spreading the virus.

""We know that there is a place for masks,"" she said. ""They are the end of our hierarchy of controls...the least effective of the layers that we need.""

While students will be allowed to wear masks if they choose to, it won't generally being a requirement in public schools.

BRITISH COLUMBIA

British Columbia has laid out its plan for studies to resume in ""learning groups"" this fall. School districts are to post final back-to-school details online by Aug. 26.

Back to class: Schools will welcome students back full time on Sept. 8, but parents will still have the option of registering their kids for remote learning or home schooling.

Groups: Students will be sorted into learning groups to reduce the number of people they come in contact with. For elementary and middle school students, groups will be no larger than 60 people. Secondary school groups will be capped at 120.

Physical distancing: Students and staff don't need to maintain physical distancing within their learning group, but contact should be minimized. Outside the group, physical distancing is required. Students should be more spaced out in classrooms.

Masks: Students and staff will not be required to wear masks in schools, but the province says it's a ""personal choice that will always be respected.""

New routines: The province is urging schools to stagger recess, lunch and class transition times and take students outside whenever possible.

Transportation: Middle and high school students are asked to wear masks on buses. Students should be assigned seats, and a transparent barrier may be used to separate the driver.

ALBERTA

The province is planning to fully reopen schools from kindergarten to Grade 12 this fall. Measures will be tightened if an outbreak occurs and class sizes could be reduced to 20.

Back to class: School will be back in session with extra safety measures, but the province says there are programs to support remote and alternative learning.

Groups: Schools should sort students into cohorts by class when possible to minimize contact with others.

Physical distancing: Physical distancing is recommended when possible. Rooms should be rearranged to increase space between desks.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for staff and many students in some school settings. Students in Grades 4 to 12 must wear masks in all common areas, such as hallways and on buses. Staff are required to wear masks whenever physical distancing cannot be maintained. Mask use will be optional for kids in kindergarten through Grade 3. The government says all students and staff will receive two reusable masks as part of the policy.

Transportation: Parents are asked to bring their children to school if they can. Students who take the bus will sit in the same seat every day.

New routines: Schools are advised to consider a ""no sharing policy,"" with each student bringing their own supplies. Class, lunch and recess schedules will be staggered.

SASKATCHEWAN

Saskatchewan first unveiled a set of back-to-school guidelines in June, but released more details Aug. 4.

Back to class: Students will return to class as early as Sept. 1.

Groups: Groups of students and staff members assigned to them should stick together throughout the day and try not to mingle with other groups. Schools should aim to minimize the number of different instructors who interact with students throughout the day.

Physical distancing: Officials say maintaining physical distance is ""less practical"" for younger children, and the focus should be on limiting physical contact. Officials suggest limiting hugs and hand holding and suggest using alternative greetings such as air high fives. Schools are also to have dedicated quarantine areas where symptomatic students can go before they are picked up by parents.

Masks: Staff are not required to wear masks or eye protection except when in close contact with someone who is sick. The province says they should only be used when ""all other controls have been fully explored.""

Transportation: Parents should take their kids to school when possible, and pickup and drop-offs should happen outside. Students using school transportation should be assigned seats, and a partition may be used to separate the driver.

New routines: Start times, recess, lunch and class transitions may be staggered to allow for more space for physical distancing. Schools should rearrange their classrooms to space out students. Students and staff are asked to bring hand sanitizer.

MANITOBA

The Manitoba government says most students are to be back in classrooms on Sept. 8 with new guidelines to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Back to class: All students from kindergarten to Grade 8 are to have in-class instruction five days a week. High school students will also be in class full time, except in schools where there is inadequate space for physical distancing, in which case there will be some days of remote learning.

Groups: When physical distancing isn't possible, students will have to be organized into cohorts no larger than 75, and minimize contact with others. In these cases, there must be at least one metre between their desks.

Physical distancing: The province says students are required to maintain a two-metre distance to ""the greatest extent possible."" When it isn't possible, physical barriers may be an option. Spaces should be arranged to encourage separation.

Masks: Masks are not required for students or staff.

Transportation: Buses will be running at reduced capacity, and parents will be asked to transport their children to school if they can.

New routines: Lunch and recess are to be staggered to minimize congestion, and in many cases teachers will change classrooms instead of students.

ONTARIO

Ontario students will be back in class September, but their schedules and class sizes may vary depending on where they live.

Back to class: Elementary students and many high schoolers will be in school five days a week in standard class sizes. However, secondary students at two dozen boards that are higher risk will only attend class half the time, and will spend the rest of the week working on ""curriculum-linked independent work."" Parents will also have the option to keep their kids out of class, and boards must provide options for remote learning.

Groups: For high schoolers in high-risk districts, class sizes will be capped at 15. Meanwhile, elementary students won't be broken up into smaller groups, but will be grouped into cohorts and their exposure to different teachers will be limited.

Physical distancing: While Education Minister Stephen Lecce said the aim is to keep students one metre apart from each other, a guidance document says only that schools should promote ""as much distancing as possible"" rather than being strictly enforced.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 through 12, and will be strongly encouraged for younger kids when they're in indoor common areas. Staff will be expected to wear masks.

Transportation: Some school boards may have more than one student assigned to a seat. When physical distancing isn't possible, masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 to 12, and younger students will be encouraged but not required to do the same.

New routines: Students in some districts will have to pre-register for in-person schooling. Some schools may limit or even ban visitors, including parents. Breaks will be scheduled to allow students to wash their hands.

QUEBEC

All elementary and high school students in Quebec will be required to attend class in September unless they have a doctor's note indicating they're at high risk of COVID-19 complications or they live with someone at risk. Those students will be allowed to study remotely.

Back to class: Class attendance is mandatory for elementary and high school students. For Grades 10 and 11, schools have the option of alternating schedules where students attend one day out of every two — as long as schools cannot maintain stable classroom bubbles. Grade 10 and 11 students are encouraged to attend classes as much as possible.

Groups: Each classroom will be its own bubble and students will not be required to maintain a two-metre distance between classmates.

Physical distancing: Students will need to keep a two-metre distance from all school staff, as well as all other students outside their classroom bubble. There are no physical distancing requirements for children or teachers in pre-school.

Masks: All students in Grade 5 and up — as well as all school staff — must wear a mask inside all common areas of the school except the classroom. Masks can also be removed when students are eating.

Transportation: No more than 48 students will be allowed on a school bus, with no more than two students sitting on the same bench. Preschool and elementary school students are strongly encouraged to wear masks, while older students are required to wear them.

New routines: When schools return in the fall, teachers will move from classroom to classroom, but students will stay put.

Backup plans: In the event of an outbreak in one class, the entire classroom bubble will be sent home to continue studies remotely. Authorities are also putting together an emergency protocol in the event of a second wave to ensure instruction continues online if entire schools are again forced to close. Ideas include quickly distributing tablets or laptops to students needing them and establishing a digital platform to continue courses and maintain communication.

NEW BRUNSWICK

The province has outlined a set of requirements schools must follow in developing their plans for the fall.

Back to class: Students in kindergarten to Grade 8 are to attend school full time, while those in Grades 9 to 12 are to be taught using a combination of in-class and remote instruction. At-home course work can include online learning, guided projects and experiential education.

Groups: For kindergarten through Grade 2, group sizes will be reduced to about 15, wherever possible. Group sizes should also be shrunk for Grades 3 to 5. Grades 6 to 8 will resume at regular class sizes. Students in Grades 9 to 12 will not be grouped because of their schedules and course options.

Physical distance: Grade 9 to 12 classrooms are required to maintain a one-metre distance, while a two-metre distance is recommended in common areas at all grade levels.

Masks: It's unclear where the province stands on staff and students wearing masks.

Transportation: The province says it's working with school districts to develop plans for transportation. Pickup and drop-off schedules may be staggered.

New routines: Arrivals, breaks and lunches are to be staggered. Public access to school buildings will be limited, and students, staff and visitors may also be subject to screening. High school students will be expected to have their own laptop or similar device, and some subsidies will be available.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND

Schools on the Island are preparing to welcome all students back to class, while drafting backup plans for remote studies if required.

Back to class: Schools are to reopen for teachers and staff on Sept. 1 and for students on Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be organized into cohorts when possible and limit their exposure to others.

Physical distancing: Students will be taught about the importance of physical distancing, and extra teaching and cleaning staff may be hired. Schools are also asked to reduce class sizes as much as possible, reconfigure classrooms and make use of spaces such as libraries and multipurpose rooms.

Masks: The province says all staff and students in Grades 7-12 are ""strongly recommended"" to wear masks when physical distancing cannot be maintained. Students from kindergarten through Grade 6 may wear masks when physical distancing is impossible. Staff interacting with children who have complex medical needs are strongly recommended to wear face shields and gloves.

Transportation: Parents are asked to take their kids to school whenever possible. To reduce the number of riders on buses, schools may add vehicles and routes or implement walk-to-school programs. It is strongly recommended that all students and drivers wear masks on the bus.

New routines: P.E.I. education authorities are revising curricula for this school year to make up for learning gaps caused by lockdown constraints. Schools will stagger schedules to minimize congestion. The provincial school food program will be expanded next year in keeping with public health precautions. Elementary school students will stay in their classrooms for lunch.

NOVA SCOTIA

Education Minister Zach Churchill says the province's objective is for schools to return to 100 per cent capacity in the fall, but its plan includes measures to address the possible onset of a second wave of COVID-19.

Back to class: The province aims to have all elementary and high school students in classrooms by Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be asked to keep to cohorts.

Physical distancing: Students and staff will be encouraged to maintain a two-metre distance whenever possible. Lecture rooms will be reorganized to increase space between desks.

Masks: Masks are not required in classrooms, but students and staff may choose to wear them. While it's recommended that they bring their own, masks will be provided to those who don't have one. Staff and students in Grades 10 to 12 must wear masks when physical distancing is difficult.

Transportation: Students who take the school bus will be required to wear non-medical masks.

New routines: Only students and staff will be permitted to enter school buildings. When possible, teachers will be asked to move their classes outdoors. Students will be asked to bring their own computers to school, and the province says it has acquired an additional 14,000 devices for those with limited access to technology.

Backup plans: If a COVID-19 outbreak occurs during the academic year, schools will move to a blended learning model with smaller class sizes and home learning for older students.

NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR

The province's back-to-school plan aims to maximize in-class attendance with the option of a return to remote learning if the COVID-19 risk increases.

Back to class: The province's plan outlines three scenarios — in-class instruction, remote learning or a combination of both, depending on the COVID-19 risk in a particular community.

Groups: Cohorting by class is recommended when it's feasible, but students' schedules shouldn't be disrupted to support smaller groupings.

Physical distancing: Schools should aim to create a two-metre distance between desks, or as much distance as possible. However, provincial authorities say these precautions should not interfere with the daily school routine, and strict physical distancing should not be ""over-emphasized"" to children, because it is not practical and can cause psychological harm.

Masks: The province does not recommend masks for children, but says their use should not be ""stigmatized"" for those that choose to wear them. Staff will not be required to wear masks if physical distancing is possible.

Transportation: It will be up to school districts to determine their transportation operations, considering precautions such as assigning seats and separating the driver with a physical divider.

New routines: All students must bring their own supplies in keeping with a ""no sharing"" policy.

Backup plans: In the event of moderate-to-widespread transmission of COVID-19, school districts will move to online learning. Classroom attendance should be limited to about 50 per cent when the COVID-19 risk in a community is considered low to moderate. Newfoundland and Labrador says it will spend $20 million to purchase laptops for teachers and students in Grades 7 through 12 to support remote learning.

YUKON

The territorial government says it's making plans for the next school year that include flexibility around the number of students in classes if there's a second wave of COVID-19 or increased risk of transmission. It says each school will determine how it will adjust its operations to meet those guidelines, and school principals and staff are expected to share that information prior to September.

Back to class: Preliminary plans indicate that in rural communities, all students will return to school full time. In Whitehorse, however, kids in kindergarten through Grade 9 will return to full-day in-school instruction, while Grades 10 to 12 will spend half their day in the classroom, and the rest learning remotely.

Groups: Class sizes may be smaller to meet safety restrictions.

Masks: Wearing masks is a personal choice.

Transportation: Bus school and schedules will be posted to the territory's website.

New routines: Schedule shakeups may mean that some students won't have their regular teacher or the same classmates. School meal programs may be adapted with new safety measures and pickup options.

Backup plans: The territory has outlined a spectrum of school options if the risk to the community increases, ranging from rotating schedules to suspension of face-to-face learning.

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES

All N.W.T. schools have submitted plans to reopen their doors this fall. The territory says education authorities are taking a flexible approach in their planning to account for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall.

Back to class: While plans will vary from school to school, the territory will offer in-person instruction whenever possible, while ensuring alternative options are available.

Groups: Students in kindergarten through Grade 6 will be in classroom ""bubbles,"" and won't have to practise physical distancing within these groups.

Physical distancing: For Grades 7 to 9, students are asked to maintain a one-metre distance from each other, and two-metre distance from staff. Grade 10 to 12 students are asked to allow for two metres of distance from their peers and instructors.

Masks: Students of all ages may be required to wear masks in situations where physical distance cannot be practised, such as moving through the hallways.

Transportation: There may be changes to bus schedules, and all riders will be required to wear masks.

New routines: More time will be spent learning outside. School hours and schedules may also look different. Students are asked to label personal items and not share.

Backup plans: The territory says schools are preparing to shift between in-person, distance and blended learning at short notice should there become active COVID-19 cases.

---

NUNAVUT

The territory has released a four-stage plan for reopening schools based on the risk of the novel coronavirus in a community.

Back to class: There are no reported COVID-19 cases in Nunavut, so all schools are set to reopen this fall with enhanced cleaning and safety precautions.

Groups: It is recommended that schools cohort students by class and limit mixing as much as possible.

Physical distancing: Distance requirements will depend on what stage a community is in, and will primarily be achieved by limiting school attendance.

Masks: In most cases, the use of masks is not recommended for children. If there are exceptions, parents will be notified, and masks will be provided.

Transportation: As it stands, bus schedules are set to resume. Students older than 13 may be required to wear masks.

New routines: Group activities will be limited. Students won't be allowed to share food in lunchrooms.

Backup plans: The territory says schools could go part-time if contact tracing were to identify a possible source of COVID-19. All schools would be closed if community transmission were to take place.

Since March, the COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on the economy, spurring widespread closures of businesses to curb the spread of the virus. That has prompted millions of applications for CERB, an alternative to employment insurance rolled out in April.

Without things like CERB and B.C.’s evictions moratorium, Carol-Ann Flanagan, with the Society to End Homelessness in Burnaby, said service providers were spared the full potential of the economic downturn and the spike in demand for services that would have followed.

But that doesn’t mean there hasn’t been an increase in people seeking those services. Flanagan pointed to the society’s outreach resource centre. The centre opens every Thursday morning at Southside Community Church (7135 Walker Ave.) and, announced last week, every Monday morning at St. Timothy Anglican Church (4550 Kitchener St.).

There, patrons can access food bank bags, harm reduction supplies and meals, and they can see an outreach worker.

“We are used to seeing 100, 120 people a week on that one morning,” she said. “But now I’m also seeing more families, and that’s because of COVID.”

In all of July, the centre saw 538 single patrons, along with 74 families.

April, on the other hand, was an outlier in the opposite direction – the centre only saw about 160 the entire month.

“Everybody was frightened. A lot of people have health issues, and so they’re compromised, so they could not come,” she said.

April’s numbers average out to around 40 people per week. By comparison, the centre saw about 100 singles and 25 families in the first week of August.

“So as we go from Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 (of reopening), people are coming out, and people are seeking services,” Flanagan said."

Before I begin, I really want to acknowledge what a humble treasure Henry is to our province. She has inspired shoes, paintings, award nominations and gained international fame for her devotion to our health as British Columbians. She has been featured in the New York Times and still finds time to talk to columnists such as me.

I asked Henry how we can find balance in our lives by staying safe from COVID-19 and ensuring we keep joy, happiness, and fulfilment in our lives.

When my daughter returned to day camps mid-May, she came home telling me that some kids were playing a game of tag outside. I told her I didn’t want her playing tag and she should find a different activity. I’ve re-evaluated this situation many times in my mind.

What were the risks versus the rewards from a game a tag? Ultimately, I think I made a mistake when I told her she couldn’t play.

I shared this scenario with Henry and she agreed that children playing tag outside with minimal contact is OK.

“When the pandemic hit, we were all scared and we didn’t know everything we know now,” said Henry. “Now, we need to pull back a little, but kids need to know that they still can’t kiss and hug, and they still have to wash their hands.”

As a parent, I want my daughter to be cautious, but not to live in a perpetual state of fear.

“Parents should limit media coverage for children. What children see and hear, especially from the United States, is inundating and can be quite frightening,” said Henry.

Henry explained that children pick up on fear, stress and anxiety of their parents and everyone around them. This means we don’t know everything they are absorbing and internalizing.

“I have heard from a lot of parents about how children’s mental health has been affected by the pandemic,” said Henry. “Some children act out, some regress, some have anxiety and some have trouble sleeping.”

We may be more vigilant on identifying a cough, sniffle, or sore throat, but I think we should also be adding the same vigilance on the mental health of ourselves and those around us.

“Children have vivid imaginations and if they don’t know something, they can imagine an answer that is way beyond the truth,” said Henry. “For example, a kid could think: ‘The virus is everywhere, and if don’t wash my hands my mom will die.’ ”

Henry suggests starting the conversation by asking children what they know, and follow up by comforting young children and researching answers with older children.

Henry said she often hears the term “immune compromised” being used incorrectly and she explained what it truly means.

“A child with asthma isn’t immune compromised. Healthy people with asthma or diabetes aren’t immune compromised. People who are immune compromised have uncontrolled asthma that required hospitalization, or uncontrolled diabetes.”

As we talked about mental health in children, Henry reminded me that home isn’t always a safe place for all children. It’s sad and something that we need to acknowledge. Schools opening in the fall can help address this.

Mental health affects us all and we need to make sure we are addressing our own needs, so we are able to support others. We all have a social responsibility to check on our friends and colleagues during this time. Even a quick text message can be helpful.

Henry said there has been a rise in overdoses and many have occurred from people who are working from home. Henry suggests workplaces implement buddy systems or regular check-ins with team members working from home.

“This helps people feel connected,” Henry said.

By now we all know that we need to wash our hands, limit close contact, and stay home if we are feeling unwell. We also need to factor in mental health, stress and anxiety levels.

Henry reminded me that we can be both cautious and optimistic at the same time.

“This has been a crazy summer, and one different from all the rest,” said Henry. “We need to remind ourselves and children that we can still have fun and do things that make this summer special.”"

By Monday morning, 130 people had signed, with the plan being to send it to B.C.’s medical health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, health minister Adrian Dix and Premier John Horgan.

Lam - who's going into Grade 11 at Burnett secondary - said he organized the petition because he has a family member who is immunocompromised and that he is aware of fellow students in a similar position, none of whom want to risk bringing COVID-19 home.

“The government has only imposed measures such as learning cohorts of 60 and 120, without any social distancing or mask requirement whatsoever. Public Health Ontario has previously mentioned in a report that children of all ages appear to be susceptible to the virus,” Lam’s petition reads.

Ontario and Alberta have made plans to include mandatory face coverings for students who are physically able to wear them and who are more than 10 years old.

While new federal guidelines for grade school environments suggest kids and youth over 10 should be wearing masks indoors and when distancing isn’t possible.

The federal guidelines also say policies in schools should stick to provincial health authority advice for non-medical mask use in all indoor spaces or where distancing isn’t possible, and not just in common areas.

“Both Dr. Bonnie Henry and the CDC have previously mentioned that non-medical masks or face coverings should be used in situations where physical distancing is impossible,” Lam continues in his petition.

“To protect the safety of all students and teachers, face coverings should be mandatory for all in schools.”

Lam asked people not to donate any money to the cause, just their voices and signatures.

“No student, teacher or their families should be forced to be in an environment where their health is in danger. Many recent studies have proved masks and face coverings useful to significantly reduce the spread of COVID-19,” he added in the petition.

Think you might have symptoms? Take a self-assessment

On this page

Symptoms of COVID-19

Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from person to person. Symptoms may also vary in different age groups. Some of the more commonly reported symptoms include:

new or worsening cough

shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

temperature equal to or over 38°C

feeling feverish

chills

fatigue or weakness

muscle or body aches

new loss of smell or taste

headache

gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting)

feeling very unwell



Children have been more commonly reported to have abdominal symptoms, and skin changes or rashes.

In severe cases, infection can lead to death.

Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19.

Evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to others from someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes people who:

have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic)

never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)

While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening among those in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to what extent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.

If you or your child become ill

If you are showing symptoms of COVID-19, reduce your contact with others:

isolate yourself at home for 14 days to avoid spreading it to others if you live with others, stay in a separate room or keep a 2-metre distance

visit a health care professional or call your local public health authority for information on getting tested call ahead to tell them your symptoms and follow their instructions



Children who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without needing hospitalization. If you are caring for a child who has suspected or probable COVID-19, it is important to follow the advice for caregivers. This advice will help you protect yourself, others in your home, as well as others in the community.

If you become sick while travelling back to Canada:

inform the flight attendant or a Canadian border services officer

advise a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada if you believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, even if you do not have symptoms this is required under the Quarantine Act the Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow



Check if you have been exposed

Have you been on a recent flight, cruise or train? Check the listed exposure locations to see if you may have been exposed to COVID-19.

You can also join the effort to limit the spread of COVID-19 with Canada's free COVID Alert app. It notifies you if someone you were near in the past 14 days tells the app they tested positive. Download COVID Alert.

Take care of your mental health

The COVID-19 pandemic is new and unexpected. This situation can be unsettling and can cause a sense of loss of control. It is normal to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared or worried in a crisis. Make sure to care for your mental and physical wellbeing and to ask for help if you feel overwhelmed.

Getting tested

Since the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 can be absent, mild, severe or can look like the flu or other illnesses, the only way to confirm you have COVID-19 is through a laboratory test.

For information about COVID-19 testing in your area, contact your local public health authority.

If you have tested positive

If you've been tested for coronavirus and receive a positive test result, you must isolate at home, whether you have symptoms or not.

If you have symptoms (symptomatic), you must

isolate at home (as soon as your symptoms start), and remain isolated for 14 days or as directed by your public health authority

If you do not have symptoms (asymptomatic) you must:

isolate at home as soon as you receive the confirmed laboratory test, and remain isolated for 14 days or as directed by your public health authority

as directed by your public health authority if you did not have symptoms when you got tested, but then develop symptoms during your 14-day isolation period, you must restart your isolation time

Refer to your public health authority to find out how many days you should remain in isolation.

Treating coronavirus

Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own.

If you are concerned about your symptoms, you should self-monitor and consult your health care provider. They may recommend steps you can take to relieve symptoms.

Vaccine, therapeutics and medical devices

We do not yet have a vaccine to prevent COVID-19, but research and development are underway. Health Canada has introduced innovative and agile regulatory measures that will speed up the review of COVID-19 health products while still meeting standards for:

safety

quality

efficacy

Learn more about vaccines and treatments being developed for COVID-19.

Flu vaccine

If you have received a flu vaccine, it will not protect against coronaviruses, but will help prevent the flu. Getting the flu could make you more vulnerable to other infections.

Getting the flu vaccine will not increase your risk of illness from coronavirus. For more information, please refer to this recently published Canadian research study.

About coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people and others cause illness in animals. Human coronaviruses are common and are typically associated with mild illnesses, similar to the common cold.

COVID-19 is a new disease that has not been previously identified in humans. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people, and more rarely, these can then spread from person to person through close contact.

There have been 2 other specific coronaviruses that have spread from animals to humans and which have caused severe illness in humans. These are the:"

Wearing masks Medical masks are recommended for COVID-19 patients in the home and for protection for those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home.
A non-medical mask or face covering may also be worn by those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home.","If you are caring for a person who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, follow this advice to protect yourself and others in the home, as well as those in your community.

Limit contact

Only one healthy person should provide care.

Do not share personal items with the ill person, such as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic devices.

Use a separate bathroom from the ill person, if possible. If not possible, the ill person should put the toilet lid down before flushing.

Some people may transmit COVID-19 even though they do not show any symptoms. Wearing a mask, including a non-medical mask or face covering (i.e. made with at least two layers of tightly woven fabric, constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can help protect others around you.

Prevent contact with animals, as there have been several reports of people transmitting COVID-19 to their pets.

Protect yourself

If possible, people who are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19 should not care for someone with COVID-19. These people include elderly persons, those with chronic medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes) or compromised immune systems.

If you need to be within 2 metres of the ill person, wear personal protective equipment: a medical mask disposable gloves eye protection

Wear disposable gloves when touching the ill person, their environment and soiled items or surfaces.

Avoid re-using medical masks or gloves.

Clean your hands often for at least 20 seconds, especially after contact with the ill person and after removing gloves, face masks and eye protection.

Dry your hands with disposable paper towels. If not available, use a reusable towel and replace it when it becomes wet.

You can also remove dirt with a wet wipe and then use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Wearing masks Medical masks are recommended for COVID-19 patients in the home and for protection for those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home.

N95 respirators must be reserved for healthcare workers and should not be used for caregiving at home.

If medical masks are not available, non-medical masks or face coverings (i.e. constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can be worn by the ill person, if tolerable. This will cover their mouth and nose, and may prevent respiratory droplets from contaminating others or landing on surfaces.

A non-medical mask or face covering may also be worn by those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home. However, wearing a non-medical mask or facial covering in the community has not been proven to protect the person wearing it.

Strict hygiene and public health measures, including frequent hand washing and maintaining a physical distance of at least 2 metres from the ill person, will reduce the chance of being exposed to the virus.

Non-medical cloth masks should be carefully removed when soiled or damp, laundered in hot water and then dried thoroughly.

Hands must be cleaned before and after putting on and removing a mask.

Keep your environment clean

Place used medical masks, gloves and other contaminated items in a lined container, secure the contents and dispose of them with other household waste.

Place possibly contaminated laundry, including non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings, into a container with a plastic liner and do not shake. Wash with regular laundry soap and hot water (60-90°C), and dry well. Clothing, linens and non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings belonging to the ill person can be washed with other laundry.

At least once daily, clean and disinfect surfaces that people touch often, such as toilets, laundry containers, bedside tables, doorknobs, phones and television remotes.

Use only approved hard-surface disinfectants that have a Drug Identification Number (DIN). A DIN is an 8-digit number given by Health Canada that confirms the disinfectant product is approved and safe for use in Canada.

When approved hard surface disinfectants are not available, for household disinfection, a diluted bleach solution can be prepared in accordance with the instructions on the label, or in a ratio of 5 millilitres (mL) of bleach per 250 mL of water OR 20 mL of bleach per litre of water. This ratio is based on bleach containing 5% sodium hypochlorite, to give a 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution. Follow instructions for proper handling of household (chlorine) bleach.

If they can withstand the use of liquids for disinfection, high-touch electronic devices (e.g. keyboards, tablets, smartboards) may be disinfected with 70% alcohol (e.g. alcohol prep wipes) at least daily.

Monitor yourself for symptoms

If you have always used the recommended precautions, then monitor yourself for symptoms for 14 days following your last close contact with the ill person.

Quarantine (self-isolate) at home for 14 days from your last exposure and contact your local public health authority if you have no symptoms but: cared for a person who has COVID-19 without the recommended personal protective equipment live with or had close physical contact (e.g. intimate partner) without using the recommended personal protective equipment live with or have had regular close contact (within 2 metres) with a person who has COVID-19 up to 48 hours prior to symptom onset or while they were symptomatic and not isolating had direct contact with the body fluids of a person who has COVID-19 (e.g. were coughed or sneezed on) without the recommended personal protective equipment



If you start to develop symptoms, isolate yourself as quickly as possible and contact your local public health authority for further instructions.

Maintain these supplies

Medical masks if available, or non-medical mask or face covering

Eye protection (face shield or goggles) for use by caregiver

Disposable gloves (do not re-use) for use by caregiver

Disposable paper towels

Tissues

Waste container with plastic liner

In today's Ministry of Health briefing, Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Réka Gustafson, B.C.'s deputy provincial health officer, reported 236 new cases in B.C. since last Friday, Those include:

100 new cases from Aug. 14 to 15

88 new cases from Aug. 15 to 16

48 new cases in the last 24 hours

There have been a total of 4,594 cases in British Columbia since the pandemic began. Of those, 1,419 cases have been in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Currently, four people are hospitalized in B.C. with COVID-19, three of whom are in intensive care, and 3,653 people have fully recovered. There have been two new health-care facility outbreaks, including one at the Arbutus Care Centre in the VCH region. The outbreak at the Joseph and Rosalie Segal Family Health Centre has been declared over. In total, nine long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility have active outbreaks. There are no new community outbreaks, however there continue to be community exposure events, including in Vancouver Coastal Health, and on flights into and out of British Columbia. Check the Vancouver Coastal Health Public Exposures page for the locations and times of known possible exposures to COVID-19 to the public in our region.

Stay home if you're sick

Dr. Gustafson spoke about the ability of the virus to spread with very mild symptoms, especially for young adults. Many people may not even realize they have COVID-19 and inadvertently spread it to others; to friends, colleagues, family members or vulnerable people in the community. She issued a reminder: if you are informed by public health teams that you are a close contact, it is essential you stay home for the full 14-day self-isolation period. With the number of people in B.C. with COVID-19 today, we are at a time that we all need to be particularly alert to how we are feeling. You may feel well enough to see friends or go into work. However, if you are feeling ever so slightly unwell, stay home from work and gatherings. Our COVID-19 champions are the people who choose to stay home and stay away from others when feeling even the slightest bit sick. Making the choice to stay home is choosing to keep yourself and those around you safe.

Updated guidelines for masks in schools

Earlier today, the Ministry of Education announced updated health and safety guidelines to help ensure a consistent province-wide approach to keep schools safe for all students, teachers and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the guidelines, masks will be required for staff, middle and secondary students in high traffic areas such as buses and in common areas such as hallways, or anytime outside of their learning group whenever physical distancing cannot be maintained. Exceptions will be made for students who cannot wear masks for medical reasons. The guidelines also cover the key components of delivering K-12 education during the pandemic, including curriculum, report cards, supports for students with disabilities/diverse abilities, and finance and operations. In order to support staff and students to meet this expectation, the ministry is providing additional funding to school districts that will support the purchase of up to 1.5 million masks, enough for every public-school staff member and student to have at least two masks.

Guides for a COVID-safe summer

Wondering how you can see friends safely or work out in a fitness centre? Eat in a restaurant? Spend a day at the beach? Vancouver Coastal Health is publishing a series of Safe summer guides, where you can find tips on how to enjoy your summer safely. Whether it's stocking up on supplies before leaving for a road trip, wiping down fitness equipment, paying by tap, or collecting contact info at a rec sports game, we have all the information you need to stay safe while having fun. Find them on our VCH social channels (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) or download the graphics on VCH.ca.

Testing

Anyone in the VCH region with cold, influenza or COVID-19-like symptoms, however mild, can now be assessed for and get a COVID-19 test. Contact your physician or nurse practitioner's office, or a local community collection centre to arrange for a test. Phone numbers and locations of collection centre can be found by visiting: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testing or by calling 8-1-1. In Vancouver, the City Centre and REACH urgent and primary care centres can provide testing as well as the St. Vincent's drive-up location at 4875 Heather Street. The Richmond Assessment Centre is located at 6820 Gilbert Road, in the parking lot of the Richmond Tennis Club. On the North Shore, testing is available at the North Vancouver Urgent and Primary Care Centre.

Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps said in a recent message to parents that she doesn’t think the tents should be in that portion of Beacon Hill Park. “It has become clear over the last few weeks, with the needles, feces and garbage on school property and all the broken windows, that it is not appropriate to have people camping across from an elementary school.”

Parent representative Rich Fleming said there has been a “strong commitment from the city” to try to use bylaws to solve the problem.

“They’re pushing the resources they can toward it,” he said.

For now, Fleming said, there could be a committee of parents formed to “sweep” the grounds each morning for things like needles. “Obviously, that’s not the desired solution at all.”

Like many others, people in the South Park community have a “deep desire” to see a more overarching solution to homelessness issues, beyond what they see near the school, Fleming said.

“Obviously, we don’t want [tents] near a school and [to] put the kids at risk,” said Fleming, who has a child entering Grade 2 at the school as well as two younger children.

He said there have been up to 20 tents visible from South Park.

Greater Victoria School Board chairwoman Jordan Watters said that safety is “the No. 1 priority.”

“We’re watching the situation,” she said.

Overnight sheltering is allowed in several city parks, including Beacon Hill, and council has opted not to enforce rules requiring people to pack up during the day while there is a pandemic. The city received an injunction allowing it to remove people from sensitive areas of the park, but there are still dozens of tents in the area.

Helps said she believes it is appropriate to amend the parks bylaw to prohibit sheltering close to the school.

“I understand that staff are working on a series of bylaw amendments to propose to council in September that will address this and other issues around the city,” she said.

She noted that provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has advised that students returning to school should spend as much time as possible outdoors, something that unsafe grounds would prevent.

Victoria Coun. Marianne Alto said she agrees with Helps about the tents needing to move.

“I think there’s no doubt at all that having tents … that close to a school isn’t the most optimal situation,” she said. “We’re very well aware that there are better ways to deal with the reality of that site.”

Alto said Victoria’s committee of the whole meets next on Sept. 3, so she doesn’t expect measures to be in place by the time students return to school on Sept. 10.

“I’m really hoping that we’ll be able to get a handle on this very soon.”

Crew members on a fishing boat in the area tried to provide a tow, but the line they attached to the sailing vessel off the cleats on the sailing vessel that their lines were tied to.

HMCS Whitehorse, which was already in the area for search-and-rescue exercises, responded, Dery said. The exercises are held twice a year.

A rope from the navy vessel was attached to the main mast to make a tow possible, he said.

“It took about an hour in the dark to that up.”

It was another 4 1/2 hours to tow the sailboat to Winter Harbour, on the northwest of the Island.

The CRD is developing new management plans for East Sooke and a joint plan for Roche Cove and Matheson Lake, which are in close proximity.

As part of initial engagement, the CRD said the surveys will help CRD Regional Parks gather background information on how members use the parks.

CRD is also seeking input from First Nations, government agencies and stakeholder groups.

“These plans will provide strategic and specific management direction and will guide environmental conservation, cultural heritage management, visitor use and park development over the next 15 to 20 years,” the CRD said in a statement.

Matheson Lake Regional Park is a 156-hectare property in Metchosin acquired in 1994. It features the lake and small beach, forested hills and several kilometres of trails.

Roche Cove Regional Park was established in 1985 and comprises 162 hectares around a sheltered cove in the Sooke Basin. The park has trails through cedar forests, along Matheson Creek and to mossy hilltops.

East Sooke Regional Park, established in 1970, is the third largest park in CRD system at 1,457 hectares. It has 49 kilometres of trails through forest, marsh and fields, including a challenging 10-kilometre trail along the coast.

“It is anticipated that the fire will be 100 per cent contained [Tuesday afternoon] as it is exhausting its fuel source,” the CRD said.

Lightning strikes Sunday night, after days of extreme heat, sparked more a dozen fires on the South Island. High temperatures and steady winds continue today and more resources have been added to fight the fires.

The CRD said the other fire, near Horton Lake, is in an isolated area and is approaching about five hectares in size.

Aircraft dropped fire retardant and water over the most of the day on Monday and are continuing today.

At least seven skimmer aircraft are filling pontoons on Shawnigan Lake and helicopters with water buckets arebeing used.

The CRD said ground crews were hiking in this morning to set up a containment perimeter.

A fire control specialist from the B.C. Wildfire Management Branch is the commander on the fires and is working with the CRD’s watershed protection wildfire staff.

The CRD said there are 18 CRD watershed protection staff and two water tanker trucks working on containing the Mount Healey wildfire.

“It appears that the nature of the terrain and fuels in the area should reduce the potential for further spread,” the CRD said.

The B.C. Wildfire Management Branch has committed two 20-person crews, 16 contract firefighters and four helicopters with water buckets to the fire today. Provincial staff will be working on both fires. The focus of the helicopter water drops will be on preventing the spread of the fire near Horton Lake.

The CRD said there is no impact to operations or water quality at this time.

However, because the fires have burned areas in the catchment of Sooke Lake Reservoir, CRD staff have started preparations for an assessment of impacts and erosion potential after the fires have been suppressed and are developing plans for minimizing any post-wildfire erosion this winter.

Between Friday and Sunday, West Shore RCMP, View Royal Fire and Capital Regional District bylaw officers, some in the fire department’s zodiac and some walking the trails, ejected 14 people who were drunk and disorderly. West Shore RCMP arrested one person who were taken to the station to sober up and on Sunday nabbed an impaired driver after bylaw officers saw the person stumbling to the parking lot.

article continues below

View Royal Fire Chief Paul Hurst said the main measure of success is that there were no calls for services relating to injuries in the park.

“This was a proactive initiative instead of a reactive measure,” Hurst said. “Having all three agencies there was a success.”

Don Brown, the CRD’s chief bylaw officer, said the focus was on educating people about the rules and preventing people from doing risky things like cliff jumping while intoxicated.

Bylaw officers issued 12 written warnings, mostly for smoking or having open alcohol, and handed out four bylaw tickets for open alcohol.

Having View Royal Fire’s zodiac patrol the water was a major deterrent for people thinking of risky behaviour, Brown said.

Brown said many families thanked the officers for patrolling and keeping the park safe. West Shore RCMP said Friday they will be working with CRD bylaw officers and View Royal Fire to patrol popular parks for the rest of the summer.

Hurst said there were hundreds of people in the water on Sunday, despite the CRD’s advisory that people and animals shouldn’t swim because of a blue-green algae bloom. The poisonous algae bloom produces cyanotoxins which can be lethal to dogs if ingested and for humans can results in symptoms such as headaches and abdominal pain.

Brown said people in the water were warned about the health impacts of the blue-green algae.

Hurst has been calling for enhanced safety measures at the park after a series of concerning calls in July, including one involving an unconscious and apparently intoxicated person on a trail and another where a man who was drinking injured himself while jumping from a cliff into the lake.

“The obvious concern we have is the alcohol consumption coupled with jumping off the cliffs,” he said. “Those two behaviours don’t go well together.”

Hurst has suggested closing the back side of the park in the summer months to prevent people from cliff jumping, or even sending the emergency response bill to intoxicated or careless people who injure themselves while jumping.

“Currently there’s nothing prohibiting people from jumping off the cliffs other than common sense,” he said. “Why is it the responsibility for the View Royal taxpayer to foot the bill for people who are making conscious bad decisions? These are conscious decisions to put yourself in harms way.”

Hurst said once the summer is over, he will meet with CRD officials to talk about longer term safety strategies for Thetis Lake Regional Park. According to CRD statistics, Thetis Lake has become increasingly busy with 500,000 visits to the park in 2018 compared to 350,000 in 2010.

One fire crew from Saanich’s Vernon Avenue fire station currently operates out of the recreational centre.

The District of Saanich said it hopes to work with community partners to offer alternate services for youth in the Tillicum neighbourhood in the fall.

“We are well aware of the impact the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social and physical isolation has had on youth in the community,” said Chris Filler, youth programmer for the municipality. “Teens are disproportionately affected by the social impact of COVID-19 and as a result of the disruption to school, social connections, music, art and sport routines, youth have had a hard time connecting with each other as well as meeting their own needs of self-care and well-being.”

Other recreation centres offering youth programs include the Upside Teen Centre at Saanich Commonwealth Place and the Backdoor Teen Centre at Gordon Head Recreation Centre.

Programs including Red Cross babysitting, judo, pottery, home alone, Aikido and some organized sports. In addition, the Backdoor Teen Centre offers specialty programming such as an outdoor club, LGBTQ2+ social program and crafters club.

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

article continues below

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister.
""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.
""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.
MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.","OTTAWA — Chrystia Freeland shattered a glass ceiling Tuesday, becoming the first woman to be sworn in as Canada's finance minister.

The gravitas of the moment was not lost on the former journalist and mother of three. After she spoke the English words of her oath of office, she paused to take a deep breath, before repeating the oath in French.

article continues below

""It's about time,"" Freeland said later at a press conference on Parliament Hill.

She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.

Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.

But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.

""There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,"" said Turnbull. ""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.""

Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.

She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.

""We don't like their representative very much,"" he said of her in September 2018.

Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said ""Mama (does not equal) chopped liver."" On the back it said ""Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.""

When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.

And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.

""She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,"" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.

He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.

""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.

""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.

""I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,"" he said. ""And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.""

She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.

""What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,"" Kelly said on Twitter. ""This has been missing in the department for several years.""

MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.

While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.

Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.

The Nisga'a Lisims government said Tuesday that Gosnell died in his home in New Aiyansh after a long battle with cancer.

Gosnell was a hereditary Nisga'a chieftain of the Eagle Clan and was president of the nation when it finalized a landmark treaty in 2000 that gave the First Nation control over its land including forestry and fishing rights. It was the first modern-day treaty signed in B.C. since the 1800s.

Nisga'a Nation president Eva Clayton said Gosnell's wisdom, dignity and determination helped lead the First Nation into self-government over its territory northeast of Prince Rupert.

""Today, we have lost a giant,"" Clayton said in a statement. ""His legacy will help shape the project of reconciliation for generations to come.""

Gosnell was a recipient of the Order of Canada, the Order of B.C. and held an honorary doctorate of laws from Royal Roads University in Victoria.

He is survived by his wife of 64 years, Audrey, their seven children and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Gosnell grew up in the Nass River Valley in B.C.'s northwest. He worked as a commercial fisherman, carpenter and traditional carver before he was elected as a band councillor and chief of the Gitlaxt'aamiks Band, one of the Nisga'a village governments.

Gosnell was appointed chancellor of the University of Northern B.C. last year and served until his death.

University interim president Geoffrey Payne said Gosnell's dedication to education was evident during his time as chancellor.

""The world has lost a tremendous leader, a man who repeatedly demonstrated a love for his community, his people, education and a commitment to enhancing the lives of others,"" Payne said in a statement.

Clayton said Gosnell's work to negotiate the Nisga'a Treaty produced a ""beacon of hope"" for people around the world.

""His focus was always on what the Nisga'a, British Columbians and Canadians can achieve together,"" she said.

When a bill to accept the treaty was introduced in the legislature in December 1998, Gosnell told the house the agreement proved to the world that reasonable people can sit down and settle historical wrongs.

""It's a triumph because under the treaty, we will no longer be wards of the state, no longer beggars in our own land. It's a triumph because under the treaty, we will collectively own approximately 2,000 square kilometres of land, far exceeding the postage-stamp reserve set aside for us by colonial governments.""

He said the treaty proved that negotiations — not lawsuits, blockades or violence — are the most effective and honourable way to resolve Aboriginal issues.

""It's a triumph, I believe, that signals the end of the Indian Act, the end of more than a century of humiliation, degradation and despair for the Nisga'a Nation.""

Premier John Horgan said in a tweet that everyone can learn from Gosnell's legacy of working to make life better for people and he'll be missed.

""He was instrumental in helping the Nisga'a chart a new path of self-governance through BC's first modern treaty.""

The nation said funeral arrangements will be announced by the family.

That worst-case scenario was on the minds of some federal politicians as they watched New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs pull the plug Monday on his minority Conservative government, becoming the first jurisdiction in Canada to send voters to the polls in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

New Brunswick's example will doubtless offer some lessons on how to conduct an election safely.

It may also embolden other federal opposition parties to join the Bloc Quebecois in its determination to bring down Justin Trudeau's government at the first opportunity. That opportunity will arise sooner than expected with the prime minister's announcement Tuesday that Parliament is being prorogued and will return Sept. 23 with a throne speech. A vote on the speech will be a test of confidence in the government.

For that matter, Higgs' example may embolden Trudeau to pull the plug himself.

And it has NDP democratic reform critic Daniel Blaikie appealing to his counterparts in other federal parties to begin discussing now how best to safely conduct a federal election during the pandemic rather than sleepwalk into potential chaos.

""The worst thing would be to get to the point where we're saying, 'OK, we're having an election' and then having these disputes about the process and having somebody within the political system decide that it's in their best interests to start assailing the legitimacy of the process that's already under way,"" he said in an interview.

Without some all-party consensus on how to conduct an election safely, Blaikie fears Canada could wind up in a situation similar to the United States, where Donald Trump is making unsubstantiated assertions that mail-in ballots will result in rampant voter fraud during November's presidential election.

""We don't need a political crisis on top of a public health and economic crisis,"" he said.

As part of its preparations for a possible election during the pandemic, Elections Canada has set up an internal working group to assess the agency's ability to conduct the vote safely — including its capacity to handle mail-in ballots, find alternative polling station locations and keep both voters and poll workers safe.

But there's only so much Elections Canada can do under current law. In a post on its website about the impact of the pandemic on election planning, the agency notes for instance that Parliament would have to change the Canada Elections Act to allow for an election to be conducted entirely by mail-in ballots.

And it adds this warning: ""In an extreme case, based on the advice of public health experts, the chief electoral officer could certify that it has become impracticable for Elections Canada to administer the election in one or more electoral districts and recommend to the governor-in-council (the governor general on the advice of cabinet) that the election writ be withdrawn.

""This has never been done in Elections Canada's history.""

It's that warning that particularly worries Blaikie. His nightmare scenario is that the government is defeated or Trudeau chooses to call an election, the governor general duly dissolves Parliament ""and then Elections Canada says, 'We're actually not sure we can do this.'""

""So then you have a dissolved Parliament, you have an executive with no Parliament to hold it to account and how long does that go on? ... If that is a possibility, I think it's one we should all be very concerned about.""

Back on June 25, Blaikie wrote his counterparts in the other federal parties asking that they work together to find a way to ensure an election can be conducted safely during the pandemic with a process that is ""politically legitimate.""

No one has so far responded to his letter.

""I find it kind of shocking that we've got people out there talking really strongly about wanting an election and the conditions under which they would precipitate an election when we don't actually know how to have an election properly right now.""

Higgs predicted Monday that New Brunswick will have little difficulty pulling off a safe election, albeit one in which candidates don't go door-to-door or hand out pamphlets.

With fewer than 200 cases of COVID-19 and just two deaths since March, New Brunswick has been relatively unscathed by the virus, which has infected more than 122,000 and killed more than 9,000 countrywide. Moreover, the pandemic is in something of a lull at the moment - which may no longer be the case later in the fall when the Trudeau government's fate could be on the line.

The province's chief electoral officer, Kim Poffenroth, said her agency has instituted a number of measures to ensure voters' and electoral workers' safety. Among them: marking the floors at polling stations to keep voters at least two-meters apart, requiring the use of hand sanitizer when voters enter and exit polling stations, providing disposable masks to electors, requiring workers to wear masks or face shields and hiring additional workers to manage the flow of voters and to clean high-touch surfaces.

As well, she said Elections New Brunswick has cancelled polling stations in long-term care and seniors' homes and will make it easier for residents in those facilities to vote by mail. It has also stocked up on mail-in ballots.

However, should a second surge of COVID-19 cases erupt before Sept. 14, Poffenroth conceded it could impact voter turnout.

""We may have even greater challenges finding workers to work at the polls and then we may run into problems with the owners of buildings where we're supposed to have polling locations not wanting us to use those locations.""

But regardless of how difficult it might become to administer the election, Poffenroth has no legal authority to recommend that it be called off - unlike Canada's chief electoral officer, Stephane Perrault.

""There's really no playbook for how to do this,"" she said. ""It's a learning curve for both ourselves and other election management bodies across the country and we just happen to be the first ones out the gate.""

The prime minister shared his uncertainty during a news conference on Parliament Hill on Tuesday, only weeks before classes in Ontario and much of the rest of the country are set to resume after being suspended in the spring due to the pandemic.

""Like so many parents, that's something we are in very active discussions on,"" Trudeau said outside the House of Commons, where he announced that Parliament was being prorogued after a small cabinet shuffle.

""We are looking at what the schools' plans are, we're looking at class sizes, we're looking at how the kids are feeling about wearing masks. All my friends as parents are asking these same questions.""

A new survey by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies suggested the majority of parents plan to send their kids to school, but that most would want classes cancelled if there is a new COVID-19 outbreak in their community.

Those results suggested many parents are torn, with 66 per cent of respondents with children saying they were worried about children returning to school but 63 per cent saying they planned to send their kids anyway.

Yet 69 per cent also felt all classes should be suspended and learning shifted back to home if there is a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in their community, with 19 per cent saying classes should continue and 12 per cent unsure either way.

The online survey of 1,510 Canadians over age 18, including 385 parents with school-aged children in their households, took place Aug. 14-16. An internet poll cannot be given a margin of error because it is not a random sample.

The results underscore the nervousness and sensitivities around the planned reopening of school, says Leger president Jean-Marc Leger, with many parents supporting the return of classes but ready to shut it down again at the drop of a hat.

""People are nervous,"" he said. ""It's a very sensitive question.""

For his part, Trudeau said the federal government is making infrastructure money available for provinces to help retrofit schools and other public buildings to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. But he also acknowledged the concern many parents are feeling.

""I know that lots of parents are going to be watching carefully what their local school boards' plans are,"" he said. ""There is a lot of reflection in a lot of households, including mine, as to what's going to happen when September rolls around.""

The Leger survey also found strong support among respondents with children for requiring certain protections to be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at schools, including 76 per cent who said students should have to wear masks.

The result was not broken down by whether masks should be required for only high school students or students in both high school and elementary. Some provinces such as Ontario are requiring masks for students in certain grades but not others.

Eighty-four per cent of respondents with kids said teachers and school staff should be required to wear masks while 75 per cent supported temperature checks for children and 71 per cent wanted screening questionnaires.

""People are saying: 'OK, we agree. We support the government's initiative. But at the same time, you should ensure that the rules are respected at school,'"" said Leger.

Parents were more divided over what to do if a student or teacher in their kid's class tested positive for COVID-19.

While 24 per cent reported they would keep their kids home from school indefinitely, 35 per cent said they would keep them home for at least 14 days while 33 per cent indicated they would follow the advice of their school on next steps.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada has estimated returning sockeye would hit a record low this year, with about 283,000 fish or fewer making it from the ocean to their Fraser River spawning grounds.

Just last month, the department estimated 941,000 sockeye would return, though it noted salmon forecasts were highly uncertain, in part because of a lack of understanding of the effects of warming ocean waters.

The council, made up of the B.C. Assembly of First Nations, the First Nations Summit and Union of B.C. Indian chiefs, says Indigenous communities that rely on the salmon for food face the greatest impacts, but the department has consistently prioritized commercial fishing.

Representatives with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans were not immediately available for comment.

First Nations fishing rights are protected by the Constitution and the council says the federal government has failed in its duty to ensure they have priority access to salmon.

Robert Phillips with the First Nations Summit says Indigenous leaders have been calling on Ottawa to save the salmon for decades and it's time for full jurisdiction over salmon stocks to be transferred back to First Nations.

Five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations on Vancouver Island have also accused federal fisheries officials of systemic racism after the government decided to exclude them in the allocation of 15,000 extra salmon this year — a surplus that arose because fewer people were fishing recreationally during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Salmon returning to the Fraser River also face the added hurdle of making it over a massive landslide along a remote stretch of the river north of Lillooet.

A pneumatic pump and tube system and the construction of a fish ladder have been installed to help salmon over the five-metre waterfall created by the slide.

In an update last week, Fisheries and Oceans said water levels have dropped sufficiently in recent days to allow fish to pass over the slide on their own steam.

A Department of Fisheries document from 2017 says total adult returns of Fraser River sockeye are highly variable ranging from 2 to 28 million, with an average of 9.6 million, between 1980 and 2014.

A year ago children felt safe playing on the street. That isn’t the case anymore, residents say. Some youngsters don’t sleep in their own rooms but in their parents room where it is deemed to be safer.

On Sunday, residents with signs demonstrated at the alley behind Milton Street and more were on the street to raise attention to their continuing concerns, which have continued since mid-March, Natalie Cunliffe, a Milton Street resident, said Monday.

Nanaimo RCMP searched the house in June, arresting two people who were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking. Police found crystal methamphetamine, a small amount of what they suspected was fentanyl, drug paraphernalia and $2,500 in cash.

Last month, Nanaimo council voted unanimously to designate 560 Milton St. a nuisance property. A $250 fine is imposed whenever government officials such as bylaw and police officers are called to the site. The house is in Nob Hill area, on the south side of Nanamo.

After the long-term owner and resident of the Milton Street house died, the ownership and probate were left in control of his brother who lives in Gibsons, Dave LeBerge, Nanaimo’s bylaw services manager, told council. The deceased owner’s roommate was permitted to remain.

But the house was taken over by the street drug culture, turning into a “tremendously busy drug house,” LeBerge said. The city and RCMP received close to 30 complaints from about 15 residences and businesses, he said.

Cunliffe said, “Every day, every hour it impacts us and it has escalated.”

Residents are not sleeping and feel unsafe, she said.

An overgrown vacant property close by is used by people who frequent the house, she said.

People use drugs there, sleep in dugouts and defecate there. “You can imagine the stench,” Cunliffe said.

Two four-hour-long work parties have cut down trees and cleared undergrowth. They use rented power tools and filled in dugouts to remove cover and make the site more open, she said.

A total of 700 pounds of rubbish was removed from the vacant property, she said.

Workers wore heavy boots and thick gloves for protection, Cunliffe said. “We found so many needles. It was amazing.” They were taken to a needle exchange site.

Paul Saroya, who is building a hotel in Nanaimo, owns the vacant lot and said he is a victim of the problems at that property as well.

A development permit application has been submitted to the city for a mixed use rental-commercial project on the site and an adjacent lot. If approved, work could start on the property within two months, he said.

Andrew Homzy, of nearby Hecate Street, is calling on elected officials from all levels of government to take action, saying the people at the drug house are able to run their business with impunity.

“It’s a ridiculous situation.”

The problem with the 110-year-old house may resolve itself because the property is for sale at $295,999. The three-bedroom house is on a 5,049 square foot lot.

Real estate agent Fraser Carmichael said there has been interest in the property. The property permits a carriage home in the back.

The crisis payments for about 58,000 low-income seniors on the B.C. Seniors Supplement were introduced by the province in April, and extended in July and will now continue to pay out four more months until December.

“COVID-19 isn’t going away any time soon,” said Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction Shane Simpson. “Essential costs are increasing in many cases so this is an opportunity to ease that pressure and we see it continuing so we’ll go through December.”

The seniors supplement for a single person is an unfathomably low $49.30 a month, said B.C. seniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie. With the supplement, it becomes $349.30 a month for the lowest-income seniors living on about $19,000 or less a year. For context, a minimum-wage job would bring in about $26,000 a year.

Mackenzie said the boost is substantial and in her mind hasn’t received the attention it’s due.

“It’s very significant for the group of people receiving this money, it’s a lot of money for very low income people,” Mackenzie said.

For a senior couple the supplement would be $120.50 and $49.83 for a spouse receiving the federal Old Age Security allowance.

“We have to find a way to continue to support these really low income seniors after COVID,” said Mackenzie.

“They were struggling before COVID, and they’re going to struggle after COVID and hopefully this will be a catalyst or a way to address this lowest income group of seniors.”

The temporary $300 crisis supplement is extended four months September through December to low-income seniors receiving the B.C. Seniors Supplement and income assistance and disability recipients residing in special care facilities.

The B.C. Senior’s Supplement tops up the federal government’s Old Age Security and/or the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).

The B.C. Seniors Supplement is not available to people who are already receiving federal employment insurance or the $2,000 monthly Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).

No low- or no-income people are still disproportionately affected by this pandemic, said Simpson.

The top up considers that seniors are paying more in prescription dispensing fees, additional travel costs for seniors avoiding public transit due to health concerns, and delivery fees for groceries.

Mackenzie said seniors are also spending more on groceries because they can’t shop around for the best prices as they did prior to the pandemic and seniors who relied on accessing the internet for free at public libraries are now having to order internet services.

Earlier this year, the Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $2.5 billion one-time, tax-free top-up payment to help 6.7 million seniors absorb costs related to COVID-19.

For April to June 2020, the maximum combined payment from OAS plus GIS is $1,514.78. The maximum for OAS is $613.53 OAS and the maximum for GIS is $916.38 GIS per month, for a single person.

The federal one-time lump-sum payment saw seniors who receive Old Age Security in Canada receive a $300 payment. Those who receive the guaranteed income supplement for low-income seniors saw an additional $200.

On Friday night, residents in Saanich’s Panama Flats neighbourhood saw a large gathering of young people hanging out in the street.

Sarah Wakefield, who lives on Carey Road where the crowd congregated, estimated there were at least 100 people.

At first, she could hear the group in the distance, and then they migrated to her street.

“It was a constant stream of kids for an hour,” she said.

Wakefield said she saw one person wearing a mask, but for the most part, people were ignoring public health measures such as physical distancing.

She said she’d never seen or heard of a gathering so large in 20 years living in the area. That it happened during a pandemic worried Wakefield.

“It’s COVID times, so we need to behave in that way,” she said.

Saanich police said the frequency of complaints about large gatherings seems comparable to other years and it’s concerning that some people do not appear to be following public health guidelines designed to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Police said they were initially called about a group of 20 to 30 people near Northridge Elementary School shortly before 11 p.m. Less than 10 minutes later, they received more calls saying the group had grown to more than 100 people, and some were becoming verbally agressive and trying to damage private property.

Officers spoke to some of the people gathered on Carey Road and learned someone had weapons, including a baton and maybe a knife.

Officers were trying to locate the person with weapons, who was believed to be at the school, when they were approached by residents with more information to share.

Police said the group eventually dispersed and officers stayed in the area to speak to residents. They are still investigating and are asking residents with information to provide statements.

Victoria police said they’ve received numerous complaints about large groups who are not practising physical distancing. VicPD spokesman Bowen Osoko said the events have ranged from parties in apartments to a beach rave on Dallas Road a few weeks ago, “complete with DJs, a mirror ball and people openly drinking while they danced together.”

In Oak Bay, problem parties seem to have dissipated since the early days of the pandemic, said Police Chief Ray Bernoties.

“I’m pleased that we don’t seem to be getting those right now. Months ago, there were some concerns expressed about the number of people on the beach but we’re not hearing those concerns much anymore.”

Bernoties said he hopes the change is because people are complying with the guidelines. He noted the District of Oak Bay created a program in May of small outreach teams that provide information on physical distancing guidelines to people on Willows Beach and at Cattle Point.

On Monday, Health Minister Adrian Dix said while outdoor gatherings are more visible, indoor parties pose a greater risk.

Deputy provincial health officer Dr. Reka Gustafson said the number of cases linked to transmission in purely outdoor settings has been “very, very limited.”

“The vast amount of transmission is occurring in close, prolonged contact, especially in indoor settings, so that means among people who are spending a lot of time together and in close proximity,” she said.

Dix and Gustafson emphasized the need to educate and influence people to make safe decisions, rather than punish or shame anyone not following guidelines.

Dix said he spent much of the weekend encouraging young people to engage with their peers about COVID-19.

“I’ve been so inspired by their willingness to do so, by their understanding and their ability to translate some of the things we’re trying to say in a way that works for them, and we need that,” he said, adding the pandemic and “this new normal” is expected to last into 2022. “The way we deal with that as a society inevitably has to be by choice, and by engagement and by talking to each other.”

On occasion, surveillance and enforcement is needed, Dix said, and government ministries met Monday to map out a comprehensive approach to increased enforcement measures and stricter penalties that will come into effect this week.

Solicitor General Mike Farnworth is expected to make an announcement in the coming days.

The credit reporting agency said in a quarterly report that credit card balances fell 12.3 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period a year ago.

Reduced opportunities for spending during the lockdown may have contributed to the drop, said TransUnion's Matt Fabian, but he also noted that people are dipping into savings or retirement funds rather than relying on credit cards.

""Recent feedback from our survey seems like the folks that say they're still experiencing a lot of financial hardship continues to drop. And there's a lot more certainty in terms of the response, in terms of what they're going to do. Consumers have fortified themselves,"" said Fabian.

TransUnion uses the credit bureaus' national consumer credit database as source material for its quarterly report.

Applications for new credit also grew at a slower-than-usual pace amid reduced access to branches during the lockdown, uncertainty around employment and a pullback on new offers from lenders.

The report did note that credit balances for Millennials and Gen Z consumers grew 0.8 per cent and 5.9 per cent, respectively, as those consumers have less buffer in the form of savings, investments or retirement funds. Overall instalment loan debt also rose by 3.9 per cent in the second quarter to $175.4 billion, up from $168.8 billion a year ago.

Mortgage debt is on the rise, TransUnion said, with new mortgages, renewals and refinances up 29 per cent from a year ago and a 5.3 per cent annual increase in the total volume of mortgage debt.

""The spring, that's usually the big mortgage season or the big home buying season. With people not being able to go out, and constraints around travelling and visiting homes and looking at new homes, once some of those lock downs were lifted, we've seen sort of a real surge,"" Fabian said.

""Certainly for some consumers that have existing mortgages, deferrals were an option, and a lot of consumers opted to take it … certainly for a lot of people, a mortgage might be one of the biggest monthly or biweekly expenses that they'd have.""

Despite a 4.3 per cent rise in total outstanding debt in Canada, which stood at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter, Fabian says delinquencies have risen less than expected, as about 2.6 million Canadians, or 9.2 per cent of credit consumers, have at least one active deferral.

Delinquencies also were on the rise for personal loans, which TransUnion noted are ""partly fuelled by alternative lenders who have been slightly more aggressive in issuing personal loans to below prime consumers.""

""We have seen delinquency rates go up a little bit, but a lot less than we had expected… and I think part of that is the deferral and forbearance processes that are in place with the lenders as well as the support from the government,"" said Fabian.

""Delinquency tends to be a long-tail thing where it takes a while. People have exhaust all their options before they will start to continuously skip and miss payments. As deferrals come off and the government subsidization ends, we expect to see some delinquency spike.""

The considerations they can weigh and prioritize would seem both limitless and relentlessly shifting.

As a parent, an educator, and member of the B.C. Legislative Assembly, I have some concerns about the province’s current back-to-school plan because it gives parents, students, and teachers a stark choice: Be willing to be in the classroom in person, or forfeit your connection to your school community.

article continues below

Fourteen-year-old Grace articulated what this choice means for her: “I have underlying health issues, and so I can’t be in the classroom in the fall, and I’m devastated that this means that I lose my connection to my school, my friends, and my teachers.”

Telling students who can’t or won’t go back into their classrooms in September – whether it’s due to their own health issues or the health issues of a family member – to sign up for online learning through a distributed-learning program is an insufficient response to the many different realities people are experiencing right now.

Students who don’t feel they can go back into the classroom also don’t want to lose the connection to their school community.

For the teachers who feel too much at risk to consider in-person teaching, they also face being disconnected from their school communities, and from the students with whom they have connections.

As this plan is still coming together, and as we see rising rates of COVID-19, there is still the time and opportunity to take into account the concerns of students, teachers, and parents to determine how we can better establish and maintain the strong community connection that schools deliver for everyone.

A hybrid approach that creates a widened school community moves us towards the two outcomes we should be striving for: Preventing transmission and keeping school communities intact.

Teachers would teach either in-class or online, not both.

This would also help to ensure that classroom teachers are not laid off in September, due to lower numbers of students returning for in-class learning.

The teachers could coordinate their efforts to ensure that grade-level delivery is consistent for the mixed in-class and online cohorts – and even find ways occasionally to bring all of the students into the classrooms via online communication tools, allowing for connection between peers to happen, even if it can’t happen in person.

Having dedicated in-class and online teachers would address the challenges that teachers had in June, as they tried to juggle both at the same time. It would also provide the option for teachers who are in high-risk groups to be able to continue teaching within their established school communities.

Coordination between the two teaching cohorts can be built into the plan: The creation of teacher pods, with some in-school and some online, would further enhance connection and consistency of learning experiences for students.

By having the online cohorts, the pressure on the in-class groups diminishes. This will help to make social distancing much easier to achieve for the in-class students and teachers, by likely reducing the number of individuals in a classroom.

Students who are attending in-person would have the ability to join the online group if they have to stay home because of illness – thereby encouraging students not to come to school if they are unwell, and providing them with uninterrupted instruction while they are home.

Students who are in the online cohort may be able to reconsider between terms of the school year about attending in-person. The teacher cohorts would allow for more ability for mid-year adjustments between the two realms.

The COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable. We need to be flexible and adaptable, keeping in mind the importance of what our long-term goals are: Prevention of transmission and strengthening of community.

The provincial government said Monday that masks will also be required whenever students and teachers are outside their learning groups and cannot maintain an appropriate physical distance because of COVID-19.

Students who can’t wear masks for medical reasons will be exempt from the updated health and safety guidelines.

Even when wearing masks, staff and students will still have to maintain a physical distance from people outside of their learning groups, the province said.

Learning groups are made up of students and staff who remain together through a school quarter, semester or year. They were established on the advice of the provincial health officer to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19 and could be made up of a single class of students or multiple classes.

Réka Gustafson, B.C.’s deputy provincial health officer, said masks are “quite low are the hierachy” of protections for COVID-19.

“That’s why they are limited to brief periods of time when other control methods cannot be used.”

She said the most effective way to prevent transmission of the virus is for people to stay home when they are sick. “We know we can add an important additional layer of protection by keeping our groups small, which is what the learning groups are about.”

The use of masks will be evaluated to make sure students and children are able to use them safely and determine whether they prove beneficial, Gustafson said.

The government said would provide additional funding to schools to help pay for the purchase of up to 1.5 million non-medical masks. It said the funding would provide for at least two masks for every staff member and student at the province’s public schools.

The mask requirement was part of updated guidelines for schools released by the province on Monday.

In addition to the updated guidelines on the use of masks, the government said it is increasing the cleaning of such things as doorknobs, keyboards, desks and chairs.

As well, students, staff and visitors will be required to clean their hands before boarding school buses or entering schools. Hands will also have to be cleaned before and after eating, when using washrooms and using playground equipment.

Sooke superintendent Scott Stinson said the school district welcomes the additional direction.

“As a district, we are appreciative that the ministry is responding to and reflecting the concerns of the community,” he said. “Having greater clarity on when and where masks will be most beneficial is helpful for our planning and work.”

Students are scheduled to return to class on Sept. 10.

School districts have until Friday to submit their restart plans to the ministry for approval. They will be reviewed before the districts share the details with families on Aug. 26.

The Cowichan Valley school district said it has made progress in preparing for the return of students and will have its teachers in place Sept. 8 for a series of planning days.

The planning days will allow staff to meet with their school-based health and safety teams, finalize planning for the year, and adjust to the enhanced health and safety procedures before students return, the district said.

“We are carefully and thoughtfully working our way toward a localized return-to-school plan that will help all students and staff have a safe and productive school year,” said Candace Spilsbury, chair of the board of education for the school district.

“Schools are safe places — by following the updated health and safety guidelines from the Ministry of Education and provincial health officer, we can ensure they will stay that way.”"

He says it drew a crowd, but officers were able to break it up.

Video of the party was shared on social media, and appeared to show a crowd of people dancing in close quarters.

Chow says groups of people have been congregating around music or buskers outside because there aren't many indoor options available during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The trend has prompted celebrities to respond to a plea from Premier John Horgan for help with messaging to younger residents about partying during the pandemic.

Vancouver-born actor and comedian Seth Rogen tweeted on Saturday that the ""people of British Columbia"" should forego parties, barbecues and other gatherings in favour of more low-key activities.

""It's more fun to hang out alone and smoke weed and watch movies and TV shows anyway!"" he wrote. ""Do that instead!""

British Columbia has seen a rise in cases over the past week, reporting 85, 78 and 84 new cases on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday respectively.

Previously, actor Ryan Reynolds lent his voice to the cause.

On Friday he posted a voice recording on Twitter, framed as a voicemail left for Horgan, warning B.C.'s younger residents of the dangers of COVID-19.

""Young folks in B.C., they're partying, which is of course dangerous,"" he said in the recording. ""They probably don't know that thousands of young people aren't just getting sick of coronavirus, they're dying of it too.""

He urged them not to kill some of B.C.'s coolest residents — including David Suzuki and Reynold's mom.

""Let's not kill anyone,"" he said. ""I think that's reasonable.""

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said Thursday that people between the ages of 20 and 29 now make up the group seeing the largest increase of infections.

As of Friday, 4,358 people in British Columbia had tested positive for the virus, the majority of whom have recovered. Public health officials have recorded 196 deaths linked to the virus.

It can’t.

It’s a highly-contagious virus that spread all over the world in a few short weeks. It’s persistent, sneaky and relentless. Without a vaccine, the idea of eradicating such a virulent plague is a lost cause.

The best to be hoped for is that the infection rate can be managed to stay below the limits of health resources. That was the thrust from the beginning of the message to bend the curve.

No one ever promised to drive the curve down to zero. But it flat-lined for so long it looks like people started assuming the crisis was over and B.C. could carry on indefinitely with a paltry handful of new cases a day.

So there’s consternation since the case count started escalating in July, to the point where it bounced back to near record highs this week. There were 84 new cases Friday, the third day in a row that has matched the sky-high levels in March.

The saving grace is that the profile of the pandemic seems to have changed. Far greater numbers of younger people are testing positive comparatively, and they don’t get as sick.

So the hospitalization rate — 12 patients as of Friday — remains far below the level that would send the health care system to condition red.

Twenty-somethings are getting it at twice the rate they were in the spring and that age group now has the largest number of cases. The renewed concern about the case count has prompted some calls to restore the restrictions that were imposed in the spring and relaxed in two phases through May and June.

But the increase in cases was expected when the re-start of the economy began. It’s literally the cost of doing business.

“No surprise,” provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said this week. “As we knew, as we started to increase and open up and move into our restart phases, we were going to see more cases.”

The modeling shows that slamming more restrictions back in place would curb the caseload. But the government intends to resist any thought of renewing restrictions, unless it becomes unavoidable. The economic destruction and resulting job loss looks to have reached the point where government sees returning to more stringent restrictions as a last-ditch option.

Another reason lies in the new analyses this week confirming the obvious: Lower socio-economic groups are having a harder time coping.

While Henry manages the epidemiology, politicians are dealing with demands for hundreds of millions of dollars more in aid and reports of thousands of businesses closing.

Premier John Horgan spent Friday in a sometimes-testy debate with Opposition Leader Andrew Wilkinson on the government’s economic response.

Wilkinson highlighted unemployment statistics, business closures and the upcoming deadlines to pay billions in taxes that were deferred earlier in the year. Horgan said the official economic response plan — worth $1.5 billion — is due to be released in early September. The government plans to be as flexible as possible with companies that can’t pay taxes at the end of September, he said.

The reluctance to clamp down again and the determination to open schools suggests B.C. is nearing the limits of assistance. The emphasis will be on reacting to new cases under current protocols, with tactics like 500 new contract tracers soon to be hired.

Henry said that will “ensure that we can continue with our restart.” They’ll do so in the face of modeling that predicts “the number of new cases may continue to increase this summer.”

The escalation stems from something that’s always been a given, but never been made clearer. It’s the innate human need to socialize. People can close themselves off from contact for a brief period of time, but then they have to go out and mingle with others. The pandemic has revealed the strength of that drive, even when it’s foolhardy and potentially lethal to do so. It’s another reason why going back to stricter limits is being resisted.

What if people just ignore them?

Pandher, who lives near Whitehorse, has been dancing and travelling his way across Vancouver Island over the past week trying to spread a message of positivity during COVID-19.

""(The pandemic) created a lot of pressure and stresses. Some people are sharing it, some people are not, but everybody is feeling it ... I'd like to say be happy, be hopeful, even though it's hard,"" Pandher said in an interview.

He rose to fame with a series of viral videos showcasing his bhangra skills, dancing alongside members of the Canadian Armed Forces, local politicians and first responders.

Bhangra is a lively form of dance to music, originating from the Punjab region in India and characterized by leaps, kicks and arm movement.

""Bhangra has a lot of elements of positivity and happiness, and it's very high-energy,"" Pandher said. ""It's a workout dance, it's a happy dance, it brings people together.""

Pandher has been practising bhangra most of his life, punctuated by small breaks every now and then, but he's recently turned it into a full-time job, teaching it online to help those feeling cooped up due to the pandemic.

""Many professionals, doctors, high commissioners, politicians, they were taking these classes. I was quite touched,"" he said.

Yukon imposed COVID-19 border restrictions when the pandemic first hit, but opened its border to B.C. in July, prompting a vacation idea from Pandher.

""Vancouver Island is kind of like the Yukon. It's known for its wilderness, its natural beauty, the people and also the great thing is that both areas are remote,"" he said, clarifying that while not as remote as Yukon, Vancouver Island still had an ocean separating it from its mainland neighbours.

That separation was part of the reason for the holiday choice, as Pandher believes it helps protect it from COVID-19 outbreaks.

It's not the dance instructor's first visit to the island.

He previously visited the Canadian Armed Forces base in Esquimalt, leading 15 members in a bhangra session.

He said he's been stopped and visited by fans during this most recent trip, with a particular highlight being a visit and dance session with firefighters in Nanaimo and an attempt to surf at Tofino.

""It's just like dancing bhangra,"" Pander said of surfing. ""In bhangra you need to co-ordinate a lot of movements to put it together — same with surfing: balance, co-ordination — and just being on the beach and in the water was awesome.""

Pandher is scheduled to leave B.C. on Sunday but hopes to come back again in the future.

She endured -40C temperatures while dog sledding in Churchill, Man., trudged through waist-deep snow while snowshoeing, zoomed across a zip line and glided across — and fell into — a calm lake while stand-up paddle boarding.

Her list of adventures will unfold over the next two years as the Saanich-based children’s author aims to do 80 new things before she turns 80. Her personal project, dubbed “Embracing Eighty” and chronicled on her Facebook page, is about getting the most out of life and staying young at heart.

“I figure that as long as you’re living on this earth, you should be alive,” said Patton, who moved to Victoria with her husband in 2011 after a long career as an elementary school teacher in Regina. “My idea as a teacher was to instill passion for life. I want to be an example of living in the moment and enjoying the moment.”

Patton was inspired by a fellow writer who was trying 60 new things before she turned 60. Patton started last year just after her 77th birthday. “I thought to myself: ‘If I’m doing 80 things, I better start now.’ “

Many of the activities are done with her grandsons Seamus, 12, and Jasper, 10, who have watched her pull crabs from a crab trap, float in the ocean on a giant swan and traverse a metal tight rope and rope ladders while harnessed high up in the trees at the aerial adventure park Wild Play.

Patton doesn’t have a set list of 80 things, she’s just embracing experiences as they come to her. And she’s open to suggestions.

Some of her plans, for example taking a hot air balloon ride or going on a Segway tour, have been scuttled because of COVID-19 travel restrictions.

“I was planning to go to Scotland, you know, have some far out adventures, but I’m stuck here on the Island,” she joked. Nonetheless, new adventures seem to find her, often unexpectedly. During a family trip to Cowichan Bay in July, Patton told the on-site manager of her rented beach house that she was running out of ideas for her project.

His first suggestions — skydiving and bungy — were quickly shot down by Patton, who says she has her limits.

“He said, ‘oh, well how about a Harley Davidson ride?’ Well, that sounded so tame in comparison to skydiving that I said ‘oh sure.’ “

Patton worried she didn’t have “any of the right clothes to look bad ass.”

The man’s wife stepped in and outfitted Patton in black leather boots, a black motorcycle jacket and black helmet. “I looked like Darth Vader and sounded like him too.”

Patton jumped on the back of the Harley and was whisked away to Bowser and back. She pitched the idea of carrying on to Port Hardy but her escort had to get back to work.

Patton’s friends told her she was crazy when she said she wanted to go to Churchill, Man. in early March. Undeterred, she ticked off at least six adventures up there, including snowshoeing, dog sledding, and visiting Sloop Cove where 18th century Hudson’s Bay fur traders etched their names into some of the Earth’s oldest bedrock. There, she describes giant ice ridges pushed up by the tide “like grotesque sea monsters trying to crawl out from under the water.”

That sheltered nook on the west side of the Churchill River will be one of the settings in Patton’s upcoming young adult novel about the forced evictions of people living in the Scottish Highlands, called the Highland Clearances, beginning in the mid-18th century.

Patton said her spontaneity and try-it-all-once attitude keep her young and close to her five grandchildren, aged 12 to 21.

“They’re young, spunky people. I don’t want to look like an old fogey. I want to be someone they remember fondly.”

Patton hopes that after she dies, her grandkids will laugh as they share memories and say: “Remember how crazy Nana was?”

Patton turns 80 on March 1, 2022. She’s not worried if she doesn’t find 80 things by then.

She figures she’ll have to keep going anyways because she wants to see the solar eclipse which is set for October 2023. “If I pass 80 I’m going to call it Nudging 90.”

A daycare is zoned for residential use, not commercial use, so it has just as much right to the common spaces as other tenants, Cox said.
He said prior to leasing to the daycare, the common spaces were hardly used by tenants.
He offered to cover the moving costs and the tenant’s rent would remain the same even if the unit was slightly more expensive.","The laughs and cries of children playing is the source of a dispute between tenants of a downtown rental building and their landlord.

Some tenants of a 134-unit purpose-built rental building on the corner of Cook Street and Pandora Avenue are upset that a new daycare, set to open next month, will take over some of their common space during weekdays and are worried about the noise of children playing on playgrounds. The landlord says the daycare is part of his goal of creating a family-friendly rental building in a city where new child-care spaces are desperately needed.

article continues below

A recent residential tenancy board decision was split down the middle, finding that sharing the common space does not impinge on the tenants’ ability to live in their suite, but that the landlord did not give proper notice or a rent reduction to the tenants about the new restrictions to the common areas.

Danica Jeffery and her five-year-old son have lived in a two-bedroom apartment at 1488 Cook St. for two years, drawn by the fact that the 13-storey building is pet-friendly and has a large sun deck on the 11th floor and a playground just steps away. Jeffery pays $2,100-a-month in rent for a second-floor apartment.

Jeffery said she’s fine that a daycare has moved into the building’s 4,400-square foot commercial space on the ground floor, but she’s upset that, for six hours a day Monday to Friday, kids will be playing on equipment that takes up a large chunk of the second floor and 11th- floor common patio spaces. “It’s 100 per cent unnecessary that [the daycare] has use of residential common areas,” she said.

Jeffery, a communications specialist in her early 40s, works from home. She worries that when groups of kids are in the playground, she’ll have to keep her windows closed and blinds drawn to get peace and privacy.

“It will be a constant stream of fresh lungs, yelling and laughing, and that’s great, but not right outside my home,” she said. Maple Tree Children’s Centre, which signed a 10-year lease for the 76-space daycare, was expected to open in July, but its opening has been delayed to September. The daycare operator could not be reached to comment on whether the delay in opening the doors was due to the residential tenancy dispute, but the landlord says that’s the case.

Mands Burnette, who lives on the second floor with her husband, Andrew Poucher, and their six-year-old son, Arlo, said she’s upset by the lack of consultation with tenants about the daycare.

During parent tours of the daycare and construction of new fencing, there was a steady stream of people passing by her patio windows, taking away her privacy, she said.

“We’re all reasonable people, we all get it, I don’t think anyone has a problem with the daycare occupying the commercial space,” said Burnette, 36. “It’s good that Victoria is having more daycare spaces, but I don’t think using the residential spaces is good for anybody.”

Both tenants say they’re in the dark about the daycare’s COVID-19 safety practices, such as where parents will pick up and drop off, and whether they will use the elevators.

Landlord Steven Cox of Cox Developments said he did not anticipate the backlash to renting the ground-floor commercial space to a daycare or letting the daycare use the second- and 11th-floor common spaces as play areas. “I love families. I love kids laughing. To me that’s the most beautiful sound in the world. So it kind of shocked me that young people would be so concerned,” he said.

Standing next to the building’s giant chalkboard where tenants can leave messages and kids can doodle, Cox said he wanted to design a rental building focused on families. He estimates there are 30 kids living in the building.

Cox said the people living closest to the play areas have a “legitimate beef,” but he’s asking tenants to wait until the daycare opens to make a judgment on noise. “I don’t think a bunch of four-year-olds will be that noisy,” said Cox, noting he had three boys who are now adults.

A daycare is zoned for residential use, not commercial use, so it has just as much right to the common spaces as other tenants, Cox said. He said prior to leasing to the daycare, the common spaces were hardly used by tenants. Cox has plans to add an outdoor barbecue and more seating to the patio areas so, he said, the common areas will be enhanced, not diminished.

Burnette and five other tenants filed a dispute with the Residential Tenancy Branch, arguing that they weren’t given proper notice about the daycare and that they should be given a rent reduction for losing access to common spaces when the daycare is in operation.

Burnette surveyed tenants about the daycare and said of 44 who replied, a majority expressed concerns about potential noise and lack of consultation.

According to the Residential Tenancy Act, a landlord may restrict a service such as a common area as long as they give 30 days’ written notice and reduce the rent in an amount equivalent to the reduction in value of losing such service. In a July 30 decision, the arbitrator found that the tenants continue to have access to the common spaces when they’re not being used by the daycare.

“I find that the landlord’s restriction on the tenants’ access to these common areas does not make it impossible or impractical for the tenants to use their rental units as a living accommodation,” the arbitrator wrote. “Should the landlord wish to continue with their intent to restrict the facilities, they are still required to ensure that the tenants’ right to quiet enjoyment is not impacted.”

The arbitrator found that the landlord’s written notice on June 3 about the daycare was not given on the approved form. Cox reissued the notice form at the end of July and gave tenants a rent reduction of between $15 and $30 a month depending on how close they are to the playground.

Cox said he has tried to accommodate any tenants who are upset, offering to move them to another unit farther away from the play areas. He offered to cover the moving costs and the tenant’s rent would remain the same even if the unit was slightly more expensive.

Burnette said she declined the offer to move to another suite because she would have to sign a 13-month lease. She’s now on a month-to-month lease which allows her to move if the noise from the daycare is too much.

Jeffery said as a single mother, she can’t afford to move to another building if the daycare proves too disruptive. “I just feel like my hands are tied and I just have to sit down and suffer.”

Cox has urged tenants to be patient and said if there are any issues after the daycare opens, he will address them. “I honestly don’t think anyone is going to be hurt by it. I hope this building gets a reputation of being a family-friendly building.”

Burnette and Jeffery both expect they’ll be back before the Residential Tenancy Branch again if their fears around noise are realized.

“When I pulled myself out of the car, I lost it,” Vernon, 21, said. “I’m surprised I didn’t die today.”

The Sooke couple were travelling south in the direction of Langford when their vehicle was struck by a truck which was making a left turn from Whittaker Road onto the Malahat, just north of the Shawnigan Lake exit.

“I looked down to change a song on the radio and when I looked up I saw the truck directly in front of us,” said Vernon, who was sitting in the front passenger seat of the Honda.

“Next thing I know, we were spinning and hitting things. It felt like we were crashing forever. We ended up on the median.”

The Ford truck hit the Honda on its passenger side, near where Vernon was seated. The air bags did not deploy, Pollitt said. Two ground-ambulance crews were dispatched to the scene at 8:30 a.m, according to B.C. Emergency Health Services. The couple received treatment from paramedics on the scene before being transferred by ambulance to Victoria General Hospital.

Pollitt, 25, who was driving, was relatively unharmed but Vernon suffered several injuries in the crash, including a broken clavicle.

The passenger side window shattered during the crash, sending small shards into Vernon’s eyes, which is being treated with medication. “The whole right side of my body is cut up,” she said.

It could have been far worse. Vernon was just doing up her seatbelt at the time of the crash. (Pollitt had stopped moments before, so she could use a bathroom).

But the car is now a write-off due to the extensive damage, Vernon said. “It looks like we were in a garbage compactor. The whole side is ripped open. I looked at it once I got out, and thought: ‘Holy [expletive]. I can’t believe we were in that.’ “

Lieut. Gerry Lacquement of the Malahat Volunteer Fire Department, whose station is located at 935 Whittaker Rd., less than one kilometre from where the crash happened, was on the scene within minutes.

He joined two separate passersby — one of whom was a nurse, the other an industrial first-aid attendant — who had stopped minutes earlier to offer help. “Sometimes you luck out and get good people who happen upon the scene,” Lacquement said.

He arrived to find the Honda facing the wrong direction. After impact, the vehicle had been spun around and was deposited onto the safety barrier, facing north.

“It turns out they were going southbound, but the vehicle was facing opposite their direction of travel.”

The crash took place just north of the oft-discussed Shawnigan Lake Road exit, a section of the highway that has received extensive safety upgrades in recent years.

But the Malahat as a whole has long been a concern for Vernon, who said several friends have been in crashes in the vicinity.

A friend of her father, who lived with the Vernon family when she was young, died on the highway the day he received his motorcycle licence 13 years ago.

“The amount of friends I’ve had die on the Malahat, who haven’t made it through those crashes, is insane,” she said.

The BC Wildfire Service said crews are responding to the fire on Christie Mountain about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, on the east side of Skaha Lake.

The fire is estimated at 250 hectares and firefighters on the ground are being supported by air tankers.

The service said the situation was ""rapidly evolving"" and asked everyone to stay clear of the area to avoid interfering with the operation.

The order asks residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with pets and critical items.

""We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,"" the service said in a tweet.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a ""fire of note"" on Tuesday.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was smouldering with no open flame but was considered out of control. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight.

Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Firefighters have tackled dozens of wildfires after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions.

Two fires were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.

Chrystia Freeland, who was sworn in Tuesday afternoon after Bill Morneau resigned late Monday, will have to manage a COVID-19 recovery that is still very much under way, with more than 40 per cent of the three million workers who lost jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic still unemployed as of mid-July.

The path forward for jobless Canadians is still taking shape. Fewer than one-third of the 4.7 million people who were receiving the $2,000-per-month Canada Emergency Response Benefit at the beginning of August would qualify for Employment Insurance when CERB ends on Sept. 26, according to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, though the government has promised to ease EI eligibility rules.

The unemployment rate currently sits at 10.9 per cent, according to Statistics Canada's July labour force survey, which noted almost twice as many people were unemployed than in February.

Meanwhile, the spectre of protectionism continues to loom large after U.S. President Donald Trump reimposed tariffs on Canadian aluminum earlier this month — Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden also harbours protectionist sentiments — further complicating trade relationships.

Key to the task of drafting a budget will be weighing whether to patch up a frayed social safety net or to broaden it with reinforced rope.

""There are huge challenges in terms of how our social safety net has actually been exposed through COVID to be kind of thin and narrow,"" said Sheila Block, a senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.

""Years and years of underinvestment in public services have really come back to bite us.""

Potential changes to employment insurance — thresholds for hours worked, payment amounts and inclusion of self-employed and gig economy workers — fall under the purview of the employment minister, ""but eventually it lands on the finance minister,"" Block said.

Debt presents another dilemma for Freeland. Ottawa has been pumping money into the economy since March, resulting in a projected debt of $343 billion, an increase of more than 1,000 per cent from the previous year.

Much of that spending has gone toward a federal wage subsidy for troubled businesses, which has been extended until at least December. Further extensions and tweaks to the program — it will cost the government an estimated $67.9 billion through the end of the year, according to a report last week by the Parliamentary Budget Office — will rest largely in Freeland's hands.

Fiscal policy is already running ""at full throttle,"" said Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter, with the 2020-21 federal debt-to-GDP ratio headed about 49 per cent compared to 31 per cent currently.

The longer-term issue is whether the surge in spending linked to the coronavirus will morph into a more permanent trend, with attendant tax and debt implications, he said.

Despite a drastic uptick, the debt-to-GDP ratio remains well below danger zones highlighted by the International Monetary Fund and the highs of the mid-1990s, when it reached two-thirds.

Interest rates are also at historic lows, which means the borrowed cash comes cheap.

Morneau's resignation could portend a doubling down on a ""'fairness' agenda,"" with ""more fiscal activism"" the likely outcome, said Derek Holt, vice-president at Scotiabank Economics.

""The timing works well, as resigning in August gives plenty of time for a material shift in the fiscal stance before the unconfirmed fall budget or update and Throne Speech,"" Holt said in a research note.

The Business Council of Canada on Tuesday urged the government to set clear fiscal targets and rein in spending given a projected net debt in 2020-21 of $1.2 trillion, saying in a letter to Freeland that ""interest rates will rise eventually.""

CEO Goldy Hyder said there is an ""urgent need"" for Ottawa to pivot to an ""economic growth and prosperity agenda,"" with an eye to structural issues ranging from an aging population and climate change to ""regulatory obstacles that go well beyond pipelines.""

Freeland brings to the table a background steeped in financial journalism — she penned the 2012 book ""Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else"" — and delicate trade negotiations with the U.S. during her nearly two-year stint as foreign affairs minister.

""Her communication skills and prior background as a financial journalist and policy wonk will serve her well in the role as will her global mindset. Freeland could well be the country’s best — if not only — chance at a female prime minister within a reasonable time horizon,"" Holt said.

Some previous finance ministers have landed in the role after prominent business careers, including Morneau and Paul Martin, but others such as Jean Chretien, Jim Flaherty and John Manley took on the title without any executive experience.

""Being a titan of industry in particular in these times is not necessarily the best qualification for a finance minister,"" Block said, citing inequality and the pandemic as the towering economic issues of the day.

""I think there’s a great deal of uncertainty, and that’s something that the finance minister will also have to deal with.""

An index is a select number of stocks listed on an exchange. These selected stocks are typically designed to provide an approximation of the performance of the broad index. This means that each index is typically within one country or one geographic area, and some countries have numerous indices. It is important to note that not all indices are valued the same way.

The key for most investors is to determine which index is the closest benchmark to gauge their overall stock market performance. Indices provide us a system of measuring change that can be documented and reported in the newspaper, radio, internet and television. Investors should use caution when looking at this information to make investment decisions and to monitor their own portfolio. Let’s start by first obtaining an understanding of the major indices used around the world.

To assist you in obtaining a better understanding of the various “equity” benchmarks, we have included a few points below, sorted geographically.

United States and Canada

If you have equities within your portfolio, then chances are one, or more, of the four indices below could be a benchmark you could look at periodically.

• Dow Jones Industrial Average (US): Consists of the 30 largest and most widely held public companies in the United States.

• S&P 500 Index (US): S&P stands for Standard & Poor’s, and this Index consists of just over 500 large companies, most of which are American.

• NASDAQ Composite Index (US): NASDAQ stands for National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System, and this Index is made up of over 3,300 companies.

• S&P/TSX Composite Index (Canada): TSX (formerly TSE), stands for Toronto Stock Exchange, and this Index consists of approximately 231 large companies as measured by market capitalization, all of which are Canadian.

If you have expanded your portfolio beyond Canada and the United States then we have summarized a few points of other major indices around the world below.

Americas

• IPC Index (Mexico) is a market capitalization weighted index containing 35 companies.

• Bovespa Index (Brazil) isbest known as Ibovesa and is comprised of the most liquid stocks traded on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange. This Index has a broad range of companies.

Europe

• Euro Stoxx 50 (Eurozone) is a European Index for the Eurozone, holding 50 of the largest and most liquid stocks from 9 countries within the Eurozone.

• FTSE 100 Index (United Kingdom) is a market capitalization weighted index representing the performance of the 100 largest UK-domiciled companies. FTSE stands for Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange.

• CAC 40 Index (France) consists of 40 large French companies as listed on Euronext Paris.

• DAX Index (Germany) consists of the 30 large German companies trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

• IBEX 35 Index (Spain)iscomprised of 35 large Spanish companies traded on the Bolsa de Madrid which is Spain’s primary stock exchange.

• FTSE MIB Index (Italy)consists of 40 large Italian companies traded on Borsa Italiana’s (BIt) MTA market.

• AEX Index (Netherlands)iscomposed of Dutch companies that trade on Euronext Amsterdam and is comprised of a maximum of 25 of the most actively traded securities on the exchange.

• OMX Stockholm 30 Index (Sweden) is a market value weighted index that consists of the 30 most-traded stock classes.

• SWISS Market Index (Switzerland) is made up of 20 of the largest and most liquid stocks. The index is capped so that no one constituent exceeds a weight of 18 per cent of the overall index.

Asia and Pacific

• Nikkei 225 (Japan) is a stock market index for the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). The Nikkei 225 is the most watched index of Asian stocks.

• Hang Seng Index (Hong Kong) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted stock market index in Hong Kong consisting of 50 companies broken down by four main sectors.

• S&P/ASX 200 Index (Australia) is a market capitalization weighted and float-adjusted stock market index of 200 stocks listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.

Largest Company in Canada

Over the years, we have seen several companies become Canada’s largest company by market capitalization. Few investors can forget the rise of Nortel Networks. It had become so large in August 2000 that it was more than ten times the size of the second largest company in Canada.

Research in Motion became the most valuable company in Canada in October 2007. Remember when natural gas prices spiked and Encana became the largest company in September of 2005? How about Valeant Pharmaceuticals? This stock became the largest company in Canada by market capitalization in July 2015.

On May 6, 2020, Shopify overtook Royal Bank of Canada to become Canada’s most valuable company. It remains to be seen if Shopify will continue its dominance or if it will suffer a similar fate to its predecessors.

What is a Market Weight Index?

There are a couple of different terms used such as “market value-weighted index” and “capitalization-weighted index” that mean the same thing as a market weighted index. Essentially, with a market weighted index, a security’s weighting is based according to the total market capitalization of the security. This means that larger capitalization securities will have a higher weighting percentage in the index and have a greater influence on the index as the price of the security rises or falls.

Let’s take a look at the TSX Composite Index which is a market weighted index. On January 1, 2020, the TSX started the year at 17,063.43 and was at 16,169.21 as of July 31, 2020 – a decline of 5.24 per cent.

In that same time period the top point contributor to the index was Shopify which contributed 637.75 points. Barrick Gold was the second top point contributor adding 187.88 points to the index.

As noted above, Shopify has become the biggest stock in Canada. If you were to take Shopify out of the index then the index would be down 10.56 per cent. This shows how much one security can influence an index in a market-weighted index.

What is a “Capped” Index?

If you are following an index that has the word “Capped” in it, then they will put an upper limit on the weight of any single security. For example, you can monitor the S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index which restricts the weighting of any security to a maximum of 10 per cent. Another example of a capped index is the SWISS Market Index which capped its weighting at 18 per cent in 2017 to address some of the larger capitalized stocks such as Nestle and Novartis.

What is an Equal Weight Index?

An equal-weighted index is comprised of a group of companies. The index holds an equal dollar amount in each stock. Each company’s stock carries equal importance in determining the performance and total value of the index. Many market-weighted indices will have an equal weight index equivalent. For example, the S&P 500 Index has an equal weighted version where it takes all the constituents of the S&P 500 Index and assigns an equal weight to each.

Let’s look at how the S&P 500 Index and its equal weighted counterpart compare.

Similar to the market-weighted S&P/TSX Composite Index, a few large companies can have a huge influence on the performance of the index.

On January 1, 2020, the S&P 500 Index started the year at 3,230.78 and was at 3,271.12 as of July 31, 2020, an increase of 1.25 per cent. Three of the largest capitalized companies on the index contributed 176.84 points to the index (Amazon +66.33 points, Apple +66.10 points, and Microsoft +44.41 points). If you look at the equal weighted version of the S&P 500 then you have a much different story. Using the same time period of January 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020 the equal weighted S&P 500 Index posted a decline of 7.60 per cent.

In our next article, we will discuss how some investors use these indices as part of their investment strategy.

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

""After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,"" Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal's three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first overall by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

""A low-maintenance superstar,"" said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg's senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At five foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn't blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack of getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday. ""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League. I think it was Dale's arrival that really cemented the future of the franchise and I think we all have recollections of that first year, that Calder (Trophy) year and then everything that would follow.

""He was truly a superstar as a hockey player, but I think why he was so loved here was not just that but largely the fact that he made this his home and became one of us. I think everybody shared that sense of pride in Dale's career as a player.""

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: ""All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL's all time greatest players.""

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

""What an incredible human being,"" Selanne tweeted.

Montreal Canadiens associate coach Kirk Muller also had a chance to speak with Hawerchuk in recent days.

""I talked to Dale a few days ago, and we had a good chance to chat. A good friend, had a real good opportunity to play against one of the all-time best players. As a hockey player, we all know how great he was, but he was a good friend and just a really special person, did a lot for charities. It's a real loss for us in the hockey world.""

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk ""one of the most decorated players in our game's history.""

In September 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

""For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I'm ready to fight it,"" he told TSN in October 2019. ""I want to live to tell the story.""

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie's bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames players Andrew Mangiapane and Rasmus Andersson remembered playing for Hawerchuk in Barrie.

""I don't know where I'd be without him,"" said Mangiapane. ""Very sad news today. I owe my career basically to him and the whole Barrie organization.""

Andersson, from Sweden, said ""Dale was a fantastic human being. Such a great person. My first week in Barrie he invited us over to his house and really just welcomed me to Canada. I cannot say enough good things about him as a person. Obviously a real good coach, too.""

""It's awful news.""

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday's opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at age two and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur's record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

""I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive — well maybe a little further now with the traffic,"" he said. ""I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""

""I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,"" he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and '81 with teammates that included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL's top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt like he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year — the youngest recipient at the time — and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

""Just one of the greatest. You could tell from day one. We knew from when he was 18 years old as a player that he would turn the (Jets) franchise around. Certainly one of the best I’ve ever played with and coached,"" said Dallas Stars coach Rick Bowness, who played with and coached Hawerchuk in the '80s.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

""He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,"" said Mike Doran, Winnipeg's director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the faceoff in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux's famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

""It turned out fantastic,"" said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada's call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets ""are etched in my mind every day that I live.""

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes' ring of honour.

Hawerchuk re-wrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia whom he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

""It's like going back down memory lane,"" he said in his induction speech.

""All the experiences have been fantastic,"" he added. ""I mean, sometimes they didn't feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing ... Even though I didn't win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn't change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.""

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets' Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November 2017.

""Tonight we fly Ducky's number high,"" said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue's ""Home Sweet Home,"" before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

""Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,"" said the PA announcer.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

""I've been to every part of (Manitoba), either golfing or playing (softball),"" Hawerchuk said. ""I've gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I'm honoured and I'm very humbled.""

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.

Bighill and Mitchell, in separate media availabilities Tuesday, offered very similar opinions on what the cancellation could mean for the league. Bighill, a middle linebacker, helped the Winnipeg Blue Bombers capture the Grey Cup last year after quarterback Mitchell guided the Calgary Stampeders to the '18 CFL title.

""This is a good opportunity for us to strengthen,"" Bighill said during a conference call that also involved Bombers quarterback Zach Collaros. ""We need to build a better relationship (between) the CFLPA and CFL as far as how well we're communicating and build a real relationship that we can move forward on.

""Randy (CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie) has said multiple times the business model has been broken so how do we fix it? Those are things that need to be addressed and we've got time to do that.""

Mitchell agreed.

""I just want to see the CFL and CFLPA work together in a more unified sense,"" Mitchell said. ""I think right now we can just come together and really find a way to make the CFL better, not just for 2021 . . . but the next 50 years, for guys who are going to come after us.

""I think this is a good chance to do it, so whatever that looks like I'm all for it.""

The CFL and CFLPA have had a sometimes acrimonious relationship, especially during collective bargaining talks. But the two sides were said to be close to having an amended CBA that would've allowed for a season to be played with federal funding.

But even that wasn't an entirely smooth process. In June, CFLPA executive director Brian Ramsey took to Twitter to express his frustration that the union hadn't heard from the league regarding its 2020 plans.

""We really didn't an offer to sit at the table and talk until June and then we really didn't get to look at a collective bargaining agreement until July,"" Bighill said. ""There could've been a lot of things, I think, that could've been done earlier.

""We need to work better together as a league and player reps and players union to make this product better.""

Collaros and Bighill played big roles in the Bombers downing the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 33-12 for their first Grey Cup title since 1990. Collaros was looking forward to defending that championship this year.

""I don't know if you win the championship in 2019 and 2021 if that counts as back-to-back,"" Collaros said. ""Man, it's really disappointing not to be able to get on the field and defend that title this year.""

A shortened CFL season would've been held in Winnipeg, the league's tentative hub city. In April, Collaros and his wife, Nicole, became first-time parents and although playing football would've meant being away from his family in a CFL bubble, Collaros was committed to suiting up for a 2020 campaign.

""It definitely would've been a conversation to have with my wife but I think we were both aligned on the same page that I was going to play,"" he said. ""We need to make money, that's the bottom line.

""I guess it's a good thing we don't have to have the conversation but at the same time you put a lot of work in to get ready for the season, physically and mentally. To have that kind of taken away and be strung along for months was not fun.""

Many CFL players will have to find alternate sources of income. Mitchell considers himself lucky as he received a signing bonus from Calgary as part of a restructured contract in December.

Mitchell, twice the CFL's most outstanding player, will use the extra time to further recover from off-season shoulder surgery.

""A year is lost but coming off shoulder surgery I really feel like . . . it's going to allow me to get my shoulder to 100 per cent and body feeling great,"" he said. ""I feel disappointed but blessed at the same time I'll be able to get my body and shoulder completely ready to go.""

Bighill, 31, who also won a Grey Cup with B.C. in 2011, will also be busy, working as a financial adviser.

""The idea was to be building a business that eventually I'd transition to (upon retirement),"" said Bighill, twice the CFL's top defensive player. ""It's good for me to be in a position that I am to at least have something I'm building and working on.""

Collaros, 31, who lives just outside Toronto in Aurora, Ont., with his wife and young daughter, has some details to iron out before deciding what's next.

""The trouble with me right now living in Canada is my permanent residency hasn't gone through yet,"" he said. ""So right now I'm only under contract to work for the CFL.

""We're trying to get that all squared away and figure out what to do moving forward.""

Collaros is hopeful fans stick with the CFL.

""I've really grown to love this game, the Canadian game, this league and the fans,"" he said. ""We just ask for the fans to stick behind us and know that we're putting all the work in to come back better and stronger in 2021.""

“I still have 13 perfectly good clubs in my bag,” said the pro out of Beach Grove, who lost the club face on his three wood.

Those other clubs were plenty good enough to carry Cao to a share of the first-round lead Monday at 4-under 67 in the Canada Life Series golf tournament on the Bear Mountain Valley course.

“It was nothing special, just a good, solid round,” said the Tsawwassen resident.

“All the top guys played pretty well.”

They included former SFU golf team captain Scott Kerr, who was tied for first with Cao at 67. Andrew Harrison and Michael Blair were tied at 3-under 68 in third place. Amateur Nolan Thoroughgood, the NCAA Pac-12 performer with the Oregon State Beavers who won the Royal Colwood club championship over the weekend, was in a five-way tie for fifth place at 2-under.

The Canada Life series is a consolation for those Canadian pro golfers who missed out on the 2020 Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour season after it was cancelled due to COVID-19. That included the DCBank Victoria Open, which has been a Tour fixture since 1981 and has featured future PGA Tour players from Steve Stricker to Tony Finau.

Cao has played the latter three times at Uplands. He had this year’s PGA Tour China, on which he has full status, also cancelled due to COVID-19.

“It’s tough to be a pro golfer right now,” said the native of Beijing, who came to Canada at 16, and graduated from McNair Secondary in Richmond.

The two Canada Life Series tournaments on the Bear are 54-hole events. The first was on the Mountain course last week. This week’s tournament, from Monday to Wednesday, is on the Valley course. A different approach and game-management outlook is being required in going from mountain to valley.

“The greens are softer and slower on the Valley course than they were on the Mountain course,” said Cao, who turns 30 next month.

“The greens last week were rock solid. These ones are a lot wwmore fair, and a lot more playable, and give you better chances at birdie putts.”

Former UBC Thunderbirds player Evan Holmes of Calgary led wire-to-wire over three rounds to win at 8-under on the mountain course last week, holding off former Washington State Cougars Pac-12 player Zach Anderson of Nanaimo by two strokes. Cao tied for third on the Mountain circuit.

Both Bear Mountain tournaments feature purses of $50,000 and both filled up fast with lengthy waiting lists. Holmes pocketed $9,000 for his win last week and an additional $2,750 bonus for recording the tournament low round. The latter perk is provided for every Canada Life tournament by current and former Canadian PGA Tour players Adam Hadwin, Corey Conners, Nick Taylor, Mackenzie Hughes, Roger Sloan, Michael Gligic, Graham DeLaet, Stephen Ames, David Hearn, Mike Weir and Ian Leggatt to help out the next generation.

The Canada Life Series concludes Sept. 2-4 and Sept. 9-11 at TPC Toronto at Osprey Valley. The series champion over the four tournaments will earn a berth into the 2021 RBC Canadian Open at St. George’s in Toronto.

Cao said he plans to contest all four Canada Life series tournaments to hopefully gain that cherished berth in the 2021 Canadian Open.

Spectators are not allowed for the two Bear Mountain tournaments. There are also no caddies and only a bare number of volunteers allowed on the Bear.

The Canada Life tournaments have been put together by the Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour Canada, which is the launching pad to the Korn Ferry Tour, which in turn is the entry portal to the PGA Tour. The Mackenzie Tour’s alumni includes 41 PGA Tour players and 232 Korn Ferry Tour players produced since 2013.

These are the first pro tournaments on Bear Mountain since the mountain course hosted PGA Tour Champions’ events in 2016 and 2017. The $2.5-million Pacific Links tournaments featured former stars and current seniors such as Colin Montgomerie, John Daly, Bernhard Langer, Vijay Singh, Scott McCarron, Jerry Kelly and Lee Janzen.

Pacific FC head coach Pa-Modou Kah expressed unreserved confidence in goalkeeper Nolan Wirth of Comox heading into today’s Canadian Premier League soccer game against York9 in Charlottetown, P.E.I. (5 p.m. PDT on OneSoccer).

Kah has his choice of Wirth, the second-year PFC keeper who played in the NCAA Pac-12 for the Oregon State Beavers, or Canada-capped Callum Irving, dressed in reserve Saturday.

The PFC bench boss said Wirth’s early ball-dribbling error, which led to Wirth fouling former Victoria Highlanders forward Corey Bent of the HFX Wanderers in the box at 12 minutes Saturday, will not be held against him. That led to a penalty-kick goal for the Halifax club, through Brazilian and former Middlesbrough-signed Joao Neto Morelli, which changed the complexion over the first two thirds of the game in the eventual 2-2 tie.

“Mistakes are part of the game,” said Ka h.

“It was a learning moment. Nolan did everything we asked of him. He showed resilience and commitment in coming back after that. We are 100 percent behind Nolan. There is no doubt about that. There was a reason he earned the role [as the season-opener starter].”

Kah, meanwhile, expressed satisfaction about the new rule allowing five subs per game during the abbreviated pandemic season instead of the normal three. All coaches used their subs mostly to the max over the opening weekend.

“The games are thick and fast and there will be some roster rotation for sure [off the bench],” said Kah.

“All our [five] subs did great work and were impactful,” said Kah.

That included Zach Verhoven, who scored the first goal of the season for PFC, to tie the game 1-1 against HFX.

“It shows the depth of our roster, and the fact our quality does not change when we go to our bench,” said Kah.

“We have players who can switch positions, so our versatility [multiplies the bench’s potential].”

Saturday’s opener was Kah’s first as a pro head coach.

“It is different from being an assistant coach to being a head coach,” he said.

“I will never forget my first game in charge [as head coach]. It will be in my mind the rest of my life. I want to grow with these guys as human beings and players.”

York9, from the Greater Toronto Area, opened its pandemic season account also with a 2-2 draw against Atletico Ottawa.

The opening-weekend flow was a bit rusty, as is to be expected following such a delay, but the games were also entertaining and e ventful.

“The last game for PFC was Oct. 19 last season against Valour FC,” noted Kah.

“The boys are getting their legs back. I took a lot of positives out of the first game. I loved our resiliency in coming back to tie and then take the lead [before a late HFX penalty kick tied it 2-2]. There was some sloppiness and a lack of rhythm until the guys settled down and showed their quality. The guys showed they really care for one another. ”

Sophomore Verhoven at 67 minutes and six-times Canada-capped Marco Bustos at 75 minutes scored for PFC in the opener.

“It was a great feeling to play an actual game,” said Bustos, who scored seven goals last season for Valour FC of Winnipeg.

All games are being played on the University of Prince Edward Island’s FIFA-standard Alumni Field turf facility without fans amid the CPL’s “bubble.”

after Charlottetown beat out Langford and Moncton, N.B., to host the CPL season tournament.

Each of the eight teams will play the other once in the round-robin portion of the made-for-TV tournament. Following today’s fixture against York9, PFC meets defending CPL-champion Forge FC of Hamilton in a CBC nationally-televised game Saturday at 1 p.m.. PFC then plays Valour FC on Aug. 25 at 11 a.m., Cavalry FC of Calgary on Aug. 30 at 9 a.m., Atletico Ottawa on Sept. 2 at 5 p.m. and FC Edmonton on Sept. 6 at noon. All times are PDT.

The top-four teams will advance to a playoff-round robin. The top team from that will go directly into the league championship game while the second- and third-place teams will meet in a semifinal with the winner advancing to the championship final.

All games are being broadcast live over the Web on OneSoccer while CBC is broadcasting doubleheaders nationally on Saturdays.

In documents filed by her court-appointed lawyer that give a rare public airing to the wishes of the 38-year-old pop superstar, she asked that her father not return to the role of conservator of her person, which gave him power over her major life decisions from 2008 until 2019, when he temporarily stepped aside, citing health problems.

article continues below

""Britney is strongly opposed to James return as conservator of her person,"" the document says.

James Spears has kept his separate role as conservator over his daughter's finances. For the first 11 years of the conservatorship, he served as co-conservator with attorney Andrew M. Wallet, who resigned from the role early last year.

That briefly left James Spears with sole power over Britney Spears' life, money and career, a situation she says she very much wants to avoid repeating.

An email seeking comment from James Spears' attorney was not immediately returned.

Spears says she wants Jodi Montgomery, who has been serving as conservator of her person temporarily, to do so permanently, but she says that doesn't mean she is waiving her right to seek an end to the entire arrangement.

The documents also reveal that Britney Spears has no plans to perform again anytime soon. She last performed live in October 2018, and early in 2019, cancelled a planned Las Vegas residency.

The filing gave a rare glimpse at Britney Spears' own wishes in the conservatorship that has had vast power over her for over a decade. She has almost never spoken publicly about the matter, and court hearings and documents in the case are cloaked in secrecy, though last year she addressed the court at her request, suggesting she was seeking changes.

In the papers, Britney Spears praises the conservatorship and its work overall, saying it ""rescued her from a collapse, exploitation by predatory individuals and financial ruin"" and that it made her ""able to regain her position as a world class entertainer.""

The document was filed a day before a status hearing on the conservatorship, expected to be closed to the media and public.

Britney Spears' attorney said that he expects James Spears will aggressively contest being marginalized, and said that Britney Spears has suggested they retain a lawyer with expertise in complex financial court fights.

The conservatorship, known in some states as a guardianship, gave James Spears power over his daughter's career choices and much of her personal life, including her relationship with her teenage sons. Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline has custody of the boys, but she has frequent visits with them.

When you are The Killers and your usual guitarist has gone, no problem. When you’re The Killers you can turn to Lindsey Buckingham.

article continues below

The former Fleetwood Mac guitarist steps in for a tune on the new 10-song ""Imploding the Mirage,"" another sign of the band’s clout. The album's guests also include k.d. lang and Adam Granduciel of The War on Drugs.

The absence of guitarist and co-founder Dave Keuning is felt, with keyboards and drums stepping into the void. Without Keuning’s jangle and riff shards, The Killers have a more poppy sound.

If 2017's ""Wonderful Wonderful"" was a meditation on the anxiety of masculinity, the new album often explores the lives of women, with two sharp portraits of tough survivors in ""Blowback"" and ""Caution"" — women whom Brandon Flowers sings each come from ""white trash.""

Many other songs are about loyally backing a partner. ""I’ll be there when water’s rising/I’ll be your lifeguard,"" Flowers sings on ""Dying Breed."" On ""When the Dreams Run Dry,"" he vows: ""I’ll be on your side/When the dreams run dry."" In ""Lightening Fields,"" he sings, ""Just wanted to run my fastest/And stand beside you."" The cover of the album depicts a god tenderly supporting a goddess.

Jonathan Rado of California psychedelic-rock duo Foxygen and Shawn Everett — who worked on ""Wonderful Wonderful"" as well as with Kacey Musgraves and Alabama Shakes — have stepped in to produce and their influence can best be heard on the funky ""Fire in Bone.""

Elsewhere, listeners may have fun finding the band's other influences. There's a Tom Petty-ish sound to ""Blowback"" and ""My Own Soul's Warning"" has a Springsteen vibe. But there's no mistaking that classic Killers mix of soaring vocals, sonic bombast and sly humour in such songs as ""My God"" and the title track. It's a solid album from a band still exploring.

""This is me. I am 'Pipe Nation,'"" she said with a laugh Monday during an interview with The Canadian Press in Sundre, Alta., a picturesque oil town nestled near the Rocky Mountains.

article continues below

""I've been working in the oil and gas industry for about six years. I took a break when the bust happened and did a little serving, a little bartending but always went back to the oil and gas,"" added Gamble, who is 24.

""My father, my grandfather and my great grandfather were all in the oil and gas industry as well.""

Sundre is set to become the fictional community of Hardwell. The drama will focus on day-to-day hardships labourers face, with Gamble's character as the leader of a pipe gang — workers who position and align the pipe, preparing it for the weld. In real life, Gamble has held a number of jobs in the industry including welding.

But this is her first acting part since middle school.

""I always wanted to become an actor because I always thought pretending to be someone and falling into a character is a lot of fun and being someone else,"" she said.

""Unfortunately that's not the direction I went to until now when I got handed this beautiful opportunity that my little-girl dream could come true.""

Filmmaker and director Raoul Bhatt says he wanted a mix of both professional and amateur actors on set, and he's not concerned about the lack of experience from some of his cast members. He sees it as an asset to the project.

""I needed this to be believable and I needed someone with a certain language, a certain grit, combined with people who have actor experience,"" said Bhatt, adding 480 people showed up for the casting call. ""I wanted someone who's believable, honest, sincere and lives in the moment.""

Bhatt, who grew up in Edmonton, has a soft spot for the energy sector and says the show is meant to spotlight the colourful nature of the individuals.

""They're just beautiful people and to showcase that beyond the Dow Jones, beyond just the oil and gas numbers to human struggle, conditions and overcoming adversity and the determination of these characters is what the show is about,"" he said.

Bhatt, a software engineer who self-funded the pilot, has worked as a cinematographer and producer for the Daytime Emmys, as well as with Universal Studios' ""Jurassic World"" and a number of music videos.

He understands there are plenty of people out there who are not fans of the oil and gas industry.

""We are leaning toward pro but again that's for the viewer to decide. If you're against the oil and gas industry that's your opinion but I really hope this creates an emotional connection with the characters.""

Filming of the pilot will be completed by the end of August. Bhatt said he is in negotiations with a couple of streaming services for a 10-episode season.

A storage lot for oilfield equipment in Sundre is one of the regular sets. In addition, a portion of farmland in Sundre has been cleared for the actual building of a mini pipeline to add to the realism of the show.

Bhatt isn't short on technical advisers. Gin Ford, who plays the character Dee, has been a pipeline welder for the past 10-plus years. She has no acting experience but intends to use the show as a vessel for female empowerment and women in the energy industry.

""I'm not here for fame or recognition. I am actually here to make a voice for women in trades. Here's the moment for me to be a voice,"" said Ford.

""I've been called the pipeline princess and it's like, you can roll onto site and right way it's 'this girl's out here to work?'"" she said.

""I definitely want to highlight you can look like you want and you can still work in a male-dominated industry. It doesn't matter if you've got the nails, the lashes, the hair or the Barbie image.""

Ford said the show is meant to be raw, but it's not reality TV or a documentary.

""I'm not going to lie. My mom's probably going to tell me to wash my mouth out with some soap,"" Ford said, noting her character is tough-talking, confident and keeps up with the guys.

Mike Vickers plays Ryan, an East Coaster who moved to Alberta to make his fortune in the oil industry. Art imitates life for Vickers who moved to Alberta from Cape Breton.

""When I read the script it was my life. I fell in love with this. It's going to really showcase that true oil and gas grit, the struggles we all face and how we overcome it together as a family,"" Vickers said.

""There's so much opportunity to better the image of this industry and it's how we all come together is how we're going to do this and tell this story.""

Filming in Sundre is expected to wrap up by Aug. 24 and will finish in Nisku, south of Edmonton, by the end of the month.

Both U.S. District Judge John Walter, in a 2019 ruling, and the appeals court in Tuesday's, criticized the baron and the Spanish foundation for not doing more to discover whether the painting was looted art.

The unanimous ruling issued Monday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest — but possibly not the last — in a case that has wound through the courts of Spain and the United States for 20 years.

At stake is ""La Rue St. Honoré, effet de Soleil, Après-Midi, 1898,"" an oil-on-canvas work of a rain-swept Paris street that Pissarro painted as he gazed at the scene from his hotel window. Its value has been estimated at $30 million.

Lilly Cassirer’s father-in-law bought it directly from Pissarro’s art dealer and left it to her and her husband when he died. In 1939, she traded it to the Nazis in exchange for exit visas for herself, her husband and her grandson, who eventually settled in the U.S. Her great-grandson, David Cassirer of San Diego, has continued the litigation since his father's death.

Neither Cassirer's heirs nor Spain's Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum dispute the painting's early history.

What's at issue all these years later is whether Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza made any serious effort to determine the painting was looted art when he acquired it from a New York gallery owner for $275,000 in 1976.

Also whether Spanish curators did their due diligence in tracing its provenance when a Spanish non-profit foundation acquired it and hundreds of other paintings from the baron's collection in 1992 and created the Madrid museum that bears his name.

Lilly Cassirer’s heirs say she spent years trying to recover the painting before concluding it was lost and accepting $13,000 in reparations from the German government in 1958.

It wasn’t until 1999 that her grandson, Claude, who had vividly recalled seeing it hanging in the family's German home, discovered it in the Madrid museum. After Spain refused to hand it over, he sued.

Attorney Thaddeus Stauber, who has represented the museum since the case reached U.S. courts in 2005, hailed Monday's decision, noting that the painting was sold and resold to numerous legitimate and prominent collectors over the years before the baron obtained it, with none discovering it had been seized by the Nazis.

He said there also appeared to be no effort by Thyssen-Bornemisza or any other collector to hide it from the public.

""We've been transparent from the start of this case, and we're very pleased that there's been a trial now and it brings it to a conclusion, we trust,"" he said Tuesday.

He did say the Cassirer family may appeal to the full 9th Circuit or even the U.S. Supreme Court.

The family did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday, but the president of the Holocaust Survivors Foundation USA denounced the decision.

""The Nazis murdered more than 6 million Jews, including 1.5 million children under the age of 12, and including 105 members of my family,"" David Schaecter said. ""How on God’s Earth can Spain fight so hard to deny a Jewish family its precious legacy that was looted by the Nazis? And how on God’s Earth can an American court ignore the unprecedented trauma of the Holocaust and reward Spain for its greed?""

Both U.S. District Judge John Walter, in a 2019 ruling, and the appeals court in Tuesday's, criticized the baron and the Spanish foundation for not doing more to discover whether the painting was looted art. But both courts concluded there was no proof either deliberately hid that it was.

Both courts also criticized Spain for not living up to what the courts called ""moral commitments"" to return Nazi-looted art.

""It is perhaps unfortunate that a country and a government can preen as moralistic in its declarations, yet not be bound by those declarations. But that is the state of the law,"" the appeals court said in its ruling."

""Find out more about what your school district is doing, and then adjust according to that.","TORONTO — Vonny Sweetland has yet to decide if he will be sending his 12-year-old sister Josephine back to class in September, but just in case he does, he's been stocking up on supplies for months.

He picks up hand sanitizer when he sees it in stores, grabbed new masks last month, bought a fresh uniform and has been testing out Josephine's muscle power with some new lunch containers.

The new additions to her backpack and are all part of a wave of changes families — and their wallets — are being confronted with as they prepare for back to school, whether it's sourcing protective equipment or choosing a thermos their child can open unassisted.

""In a COVID-era, all of these things we take for granted or think are minuscule are actually really important,"" said Sweetland, who is his sister's guardian.

""These are things as simple as a teacher helping you unpack your lunch or zipping a zipper. To prevent potential spread, I don't think teachers are really going to be doing these things.""

The cost of so many new supplies can easily add up.

A Deloitte survey of 1,200 parents who have at least one child attending school in grades K-12 this fall found the average family will spend $102 on school supplies, $216 on clothing and accessories, $395 on computers and hardware, $316 on electronic gadgets and digital subscriptions.

The survey, which was conducted between May and July, found those families will allocate $61 on a new category: home or health supplies.

Even so, back-to-school shopping doesn't have to be more expensive than any other year, said Seung Hwan (Mark) Lee, an associate professor of retail management at Ryerson University.

He recommends shoppers compare prices and take advantage of sales.

Anne Marie Taber said she's noticed plenty of sales, though she hasn't sought them out when shopping with seven-year-old daughter Avery because she tries to minimize her time in stores and instead use online options with delivery to lessen her exposure to the virus.

She stocked up as soon as she could on Old Navy's uniform-style clothing because several sizes were out of stock and also grabbed Avery a new backpack.

On top of masks and hand sanitizers, they bought a wide-mouth water bottle without a straw to make cleaning easy, plastic Duo-Tangs that can be wiped down and a set of art supplies that Avery has been reminded not to share.

""This is extra stuff we haven't had to buy in the past but it's a small dollar to pay to make sure that that is just hers exclusively,"" Taber said.

Parents may also want to consider disposable cutlery, if they have children that bring lunches to school and are worried about germs spreading through anything reuseable, Lee said.

If your child is doing virtual classes, he suggests ensuring you have a reliable laptop or tablet with a webcam.

Those who want to go all out or are older and have specific needs for programs they are enrolled in, may need to think about microphones and speakers too.

Those supplies don't come cheap. However, the cost of those high-ticket items could be partially offset by a change he sees happening across universities and colleges during the pandemic.

""It's no longer really about carrying around the heavy textbooks,"" he said.

""Many professors aren't holding lengthy exams because the exams are becoming very difficult to monitor and you can't really get a proctor to look at how students are conducting their exams... so using test banks or textbooks no longer apply.""

If you're feeling anxious or stressed about back to school shopping and advertisements are making you feel you better get to a store soon, Lee says not worry.

""I would advise parents right now not to rush into getting supplies,"" he said.

""Find out more about what your school district is doing, and then adjust according to that. A deal can always be had.""

Each summer, the former U.S. president unveils a selection of his favourite songs of the season.

Most of the artists are household names, but Obama often leaves room to showcase a few lesser-known acts, much to their surprise.

Shauf says he learned about his placement when a listener tagged him on Instagram shortly after Obama revealed the playlist on social media.

""It's cool to think that Obama, or the Obamas together, have listened to my music,"" he said.

""It's a really nice feeling to think my music has gone that far.""

""Neon Skyline"" is a particularly Canadian song choice because its story unravels inside the Skyline Restaurant, a real-life diner in Toronto's Parkdale neighbourhood, where two friends agree to meet for a beer shortly before one runs into his ex.

Shauf, who was born in Regina, said he frequented the Skyline when he moved to Toronto several years back

""It became a really friendly place to hang out and the setting for my record,"" he said.

Shauf has been a critical favourite in Canada for years. He was nominated for multiple Juno Awards, and ""The Neon Skyline"" landed on the long list of Polaris Prize contenders for this year's best album.

Fellow Canadian artists Drake and PartyNextDoor also showed up on Obama's list.

Both of them shared billing on Popcaan's track ""Twist & Turn,"" while Drake was also featured for his part on Rihanna's megahit ""Work.""

PartyNextDoor, who is Mississauga, Ont.-raised rapper Jahron Brathwaite, made a second appearance for his solo effort ""PGT,"" taken from his 2020 album, ""Partymobile.""

I never thought I’d look at that text again, but with all the talk about COVID-19 learning loss I was curious.

article continues below

Was anything lost over a lifetime gone forever?

Of course, 60 years later ,the Latin text is online now so I had to take a look.

“Sic fatur lacrimans, classique immittit habenas, et tandem Euboicis Cumarum adlabitur oris.”

Sixty years later, with not a word of Latin during that time, it was, more or less, somehow familiar. I took a stab at it and, with some help from online Google translate, I still had a good sense of Virgil’s narrative, if not anywhere near an exact translation.

“Thus he spoke, tears in his eyes, gives reins for the fleet

and finally Euboian shores”

No doubt scholars of the classics will be all over me, but you get the general idea.

No, the story came back like a wonderful movie I’d never really forgotten; the Trojan fleet arrives on the shores of Italy, Aeneas makes for the Temple of Apollo, where the Sibyl, a priestess, meets him — a wonderful story and an ancient language which had survived in the dark corners of my ageing hippocampus — vague and short on detail, but still in there somewhere.

Thanks to the exponential advances in information technology over the past 60 years, I could find what my age and curiosity thought I had lost forever, but now could find again.

Some years ago, I was supervising and enthusiastic young teacher trainee as she taught algebra — a subject I remember disliking intensely in Grade 12.

She was explaining simultaneous equations and how (a+b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2 and why.

Probably because I knew I would not be facing a test, I found it fascinating — “how did I miss out on this stuff — I sort of remember it now.”

So I looked up “simultaneous equations.” Again, there it all was, in an instant.

The point of all this nostalgia is that what we learned once we probably never forget altogether and, despite time away from the classroom, and with access to the technology to retrieve it, should we so choose, it is still at the tips of our fingers on a computer keyboard.

That being so, I have to wonder if all the dire predictions about kids “losing their education” because of COVID school shutdowns is missing the point. Information learnt in a classroom is not lost because of a pause in school attendance.

In fact, every September teachers retrieve, revisit and refresh previous learning in the first week or so back at school before moving on to the new stuff.

In the age of home-based curricular centred learning technology the particulars of even an obscure Latin text — even algebra can be retrieved and relearned easily enough — if needed for some reason.

What might be lost unless we come up with alternatives such as a safe and workable “Plan B” for getting kids back into schools at least part time is more profound and possibly more damaging to our society than that.

What might be lost is the experience of socio-cultural equity that schools create.

As our schools are moving online during the COVID shutdown, some suburban groups of parent are already considering employing tutors and creating mini-schools at home.

Other parents will buy upgraded home computers or send their kids to independent schools if they have the financial wherewithal to do that .

But if cultural equity through educational opportunity is something we had challenges with before COVID, a reprise of shutdowns of public schools as a “Plan B” will further magnify existing social inequities and cultural class divisions.

So what do we do? One alternative might be shortening the hours of instruction and running the schools on morning and afternoon shifts, which would reduce the school building’s population on any given day and reduce virus risks.

That way kids still experience public school with other kids not from families like their own. That’s how kids learn about living in a diverse community, learn about living in a diverse Canada. That’s something we really don’t want to lose.

And kids who have special individual learning needs? Most learning specialists suggests that when schools do reopen, it is those kids who should be prioritized for as much time as possible in classrooms with specially trained teachers.

Let’s get this “class composition” thing right for those kids this time around.

Finally, let’s face the fact that starting classrooms safely, with reduced class sizes, reduced hours of instruction, specialist teachers, upgraded air-circulation systems, insistence on wearing masks, sanitizing hands and maintaining social distancing if it is all done properly, will be more difficult and more expensive than anybody thought.

But as as Joni Mitchell so succinctly put it: “You don’t know what you’ve lost ’til it’s gone.”

So let’s not save dollars in the short term by allowing COVID to cost public education more than anybody can afford in the long term.

I find it troubling that a word that can be so offensive has found a place in the mouths of youths. They call themselves “savage” if they’ve done something without caring about repercussions or how it affects others around them. When they use this word, it’s viewed as a compliment.

article continues below

I don’t know if they are aware this was, and still is, a derogatory term used toward Indigenous people. It’s a word that was used to infer Indigenous people weren’t human. If young people knew this, I wonder if it would change their minds about using it.

There are many terms and names that become mainstream that are offensive to communities they reference.

When I heard the Edmonton Eskimos football club was changing its name, it made me sigh and think to myself: “It’s about time.”

There are many sports teams across North America that have their names and mascots derived from Indigenous communities or Indigenous stereotypes. These names have been under scrutiny for many years and not just by Indigenous people.

I welcome the name change of the Edmonton football team and I think it is a great step forward.

When organizations are making decisions such as this one, I don’t think there needs to be consensus. Not everyone has to be offended for a name to be changed and not everyone has to agree. If the name refers to an Indigenous community and the community, or many in the community are offended by it, that’s whose opinion should matter most.

I know many sport fans may have an issue with it and they have many nostalgic memories of the team name and the logo. There is bound to be the argument, “That’s what it’s always been, what’s the problem?”

I hear these reactions and I understand, I really do. Change is hard for all of us. The team was founded in 1895 and officially adopted the name the Edmonton Eskimos in 1910. I am not sure what connotation the word “Eskimo” had in 1910, or what the Inuit community thought of the word being used in the team’s name at that time. I do know that words’ meanings and appropriateness change over time.

I am 38 years old and when I was a child, other children would ask me: “Are you an Indian?” The word “Indian” was used back then, and hopefully, no one today would ever ask me that same question with that phrasing today.

Politically correct terms have changed over the years. When I was in middle school, my peers asked me if I was “Native.” By my late teens. I was asked if I was “First Nations.” Then the questions changed to “Aboriginal” and now the word is “Indigenous.”

As correct terms evolve, we can do our best to evolve with them and listen to others who can correct us when a term or phrase being used can be deemed offensive. We can’t all stay up-to-date on everything all the time, and that’s when we can rely on teaching moments as they happen.

With the Edmonton team the name has been under scrutiny for a while, it’s not something that just happened overnight.

I am of First Nations and Inuit descent, and my family is from Fort Chipewyan in northern Alberta. I was adopted at birth and not raised in an Indigenous home. I am very proud to have Inuit roots even if I don’t know very much about my culture.

I have seen online the support of Inuit leaders and Elders toward the decision to change the name of the Edmonton team.

In the United States, the Washington Redskins football club has announced its name change as well. It has had the same name since 1937. For the 2020 season it will be called Washington Football Team.

I am impressed that these institutions have committed to doing better and in this process they are publicly demonstrating the importance of respecting Indigenous people. It’s steps like this that start conversations and demonstrate why using the term “savage” isn’t OK."

Effort of 2 men in dog rescue is inspiring

“Dog rescued from cave, reunited with owners three months after becoming lost,” Aug. 12.

I want to thank the Times Colonist for bringing us the story about the rescue of Stella the dog by Zach Regan and Matt Johnson. In these anxiety inducing times their story is just the tonic we need. It gave us the chance to marvel at the determination and perseverance of two young men who put a lot of effort into doing the right thing.

Not only did they go to great inconvenience and some risk to bring the dog off the beach, but they also followed up by making the extra effort to contact the non-profit ROAM group that reunites owners with their missing pets. And then to find out that the owners had lost the dog on their honeymoon hike, leaving a dark cloud on what should be a happy time, made the rescue and reunion all the more poignant.

Zach said it was the best outcome he could have hoped for and it was the best outcome for all the TC readers too. You gave us the gift of an uplifting story of hope just when we needed it most!

Out on trail, keep dogs on leash

Fortunately this saga had a happy ending. Zach Regan and Matt Johnson are true heroes for rescuing Stella from where she was trapped on the Juan de Fuca Trail.

Dogs are meant to be on-leash on the Juan de Fuca Provincial Park trail for good reasons — protection of wildlife, maintaining the integrity of the trail environment, as well as for the protection of the dogs and others. This is a rugged hike with many potentially treacherous areas and drop-offs if one ventures off the designated trail.

Even a well trained dog will “take off” to chase an animal or if frightened by something in the wilderness, especially an unfamiliar dense wilderness. Many people think their dog will stick with them, but dogs will be dogs. Those of us who live in the rural areas see many poorly controlled dogs off-leash in our parks and on our trails, which is increasing with everyone heading out of town to the country during the pandemic.

As a dog owner, I can imagine the anguish the owners would have suffered after losing Stella. But my sympathies are more with Stella, and I shudder to think what she endured over the three months she was missing. It is up to us to make sure our pets are managed safely.

Restaurant servers should wear masks

Over the last few weeks my wife and I, both seniors have ventured out to some of our favourite places for lunch. Of the four that we visited we would only consider returning to one. All had very good signage, tables well spaced apart and sanitized before use and also separate entrance and exit.

However, apart from one, the serving staff did not wear masks and stood above us, right next to the table, to take our orders. We are encouraged to wear masks when social distancing is not possible so why not in restaurants? It is important to help our local businesses during these turbulent times but they must make customers feel safe in order to gain our continued support.

Positive attitude will help keep us healthy

Re: “Please focus on the positive,” letter, Aug. 14.

The letter writer invites us to focus on the positive. A good reminder especially during these COVID times.

It brings to mind how much we hear about the “number of cases” in B.C. and the rest of the world. Five months of this makes me feel like I’m being brain-washed.

Have we forgotten the miracles of our bodies? We cut ourselves and the body immediately begins to heal. That is the nature of our bodies – to heal – always wanting to bring itself back into balance and health. But many may feel their bodies have betrayed them.

But where have we betrayed our bodies and not given them what they need in order to be at optimal health? A positive attitude is always important, so perhaps shifting our focus away from the daily COVID numbers and putting our attention on something more constructive, like keeping our bodies healthier, might be a positive use of our time.

They were here illegally

Re: “Dozens gather for 10th ­anniversary of MV Sun Sea arrival,” Aug. 14.

Why is it that the media always seems to make the Conservatives under Stephen Harper sound like “bad guys,” which was exactly what the comment “were labelled by the then-Conservative government as ‘terrorists and illegals,’ ” sounded like.

The people who arrived on the MV Sun Sea were here illegally.

“We were detained, interrogated, stripped of our names and identities,” she said. Yes, they were , that’s what all countries do when someone enters their country illegally. Yes, they were migrants fleeing a war zone and people appreciate that, but they came here illegally and should expect to be thoroughly checked.

Federal Public Safety Minister Vic Toews called some of the passengers “suspected human smugglers and terrorists” and warned about criminal organizations abusing Canada’s refugee system.” That’s what he was supposed to do. Yes, we have to be compassionate for these people, but we also have to follow the rules to make sure Canada is safe.

A lack of cheering for Toronto teams

A friend recently asked why I was not a fan of the Jays/Leafs/Raptors, all Toronto teams that do reasonably well, especially the Raptors who won it all last year. My answer was quite simply that I did not appreciate the fact that all sports reporting in Canada seems to come out of Toronto (with the exception of the Canucks — their coverage in this area is excellent) and as a result we get bombarded by Toronto’s point of view and often with a bias.

Imagine if you will that the head coach of one of Toronto’s teams was rushed to the hospital in the middle of an important playoff series. You can be sure this would be covered by every outlet of the Toronto media, this being a Toronto story.

Last night, the head coach of the Montreal Canadiens was rushed to hospital, in the night following the Habs game with the Philadelphia Flyers. Tonight, on the National, not a single mention was made of this.

However, this story was not about Toronto.

Generic replies from the government

I have been writing to the minister of municipal affairs and housing. The response I receive smacks of a form letter. It doesn’t really address my concerns about providing so many benefits to people who move here who are homeless or addicted to drugs that come here from other provinces.

One of the best climates in the world, where they can camp in beautiful surroundings, while they are provided with all their necessities. Why not move to Victoria?

Clearly, Victoria is attracting large numbers of homeless and drug-addicted because of the support system here. And yet we don’t see decreasing numbers, we see increasing numbers. It seems apparent that the plans in place are not working effectively. The provincial and city governments need to consider another approach.

How their words are heeded

It has little to do with nice Bonnie Henry or stern Minister Dix, but more to do with how their words are heeded.

It is almost heresy to say the least negative remark about our provincial health officer — she has been de facto premier for the past few months .

And she is most often on target with her remarks if sometimes a little condescending. The slavish adherence to heath information that is almost changing daily is also a risky business.

The latest COVID-19 numbers for B.C., third largest daily increase this week since the virus arrived, shows only too clearly that it is the public that must take hold of the advice and practice common sense behaviour.

Canada as a whole and B.C. as well need more testing as well as more contact tracing , evidenced by the fact that the province has just now increased the number of people that will be doing contact tracing .

It might be useful to remind ourselves that virus incidence in B.C. is not the lowest of any province, and that as a country our testing rate is lower that the U.S. testing rate. According to worldometers.info, the U.S. is testing at a rate of 204,000 per million population and Canada at 121,000.

Of course, that is not to say that B.C. has not done well up to now but it is to indicate that we may have been a little complacent given our performance vis a vis the bigger provinces, ignoring perhaps the urban concentration of say Greater Toronto which has 5.9 million people, which is larger than B.C.’s total population of 4.6 million and more than double Metro Vancouver.

Keep Ocean Blvd. closed to cars

I would like to say how very much I and others are enjoying the Ocean Boulevard and Esquimalt Lagoon now that barriers block it from being used as a thoroughfare. Other walkers agree with me that with no cars to avoid, just being there is a peaceful and lovely experience.

I understand that a referendum about keeping it that way was voted on and the cars won out with the result that in September the barriers will be removed and drivers will once again push us park users, walkers, joggers and cyclists to the edges of the road.

Much as I hate using the word in ANY context, commuters should NOT trump families; parks are for people not cars — particularly as this one is also a bird sanctuary. It isn’t as though commuters have no other route to take and no other choice to make.

Everyone I’ve spoken to is just loving the way things have been since the barriers went up and I would like to call for a second referendum to be presented, this one with a lot more publicity than last time, and I think you would find the end result to be in favour of peace and quiet, not for pollution, noise, speeding and verbal abuse.

Please reconsider.

What the premier actually said

Re: “Vandalism needs to be condemned,” letter, Aug. 13

I’m sad to see another letter from an Albertan who has told been told “fake news” in regards to our premier’s statement about out-of-province plates. It includes wrong information about what John Horgan said, as well as other inflammatory statements.

Our premier welcomes our fellow Canadians from Alberta.

I listened to what he said and he berated any British Colombians acting with hate towards visitors and is very sympathetic towards anyone being subjected to harassment. After many statements like this, he mentioned that as an alternative to avoid being vandalized and harassed, visitors could use public transit and newly arrived residents need to update their vehicle registration. I feel the letter writer already had a bias against the premier and used this misinformation against him and I would like to correct that.

It’s more than just the mayor deciding

It is always with great amusement that I read letters to the editor, or articles, berating various elected officials. Lately, the flurry has been over the Richardson bike lanes.

Lisa Helps, as mayor of Victoria, has been on the receiving end of much of the criticism.

I don’t live in Victoria, I don’t vote for their city council, but I would remind the various objectors: Mayor Helps is not a one-person council. Victoria city has nine elected councillors (eight plus a mayor).

Any motion before council, the nasty bike lanes included, need a majority. For all the bike lane development in this city it has been just that: a majority of council voted in favour.

On the most recent bike lane additions, namely Richardson, only two councillors voted against it (Young and Thornton-Joe). That means the mayor alone was not responsible, but seven of the elected council thought it was a great idea. And it doesn’t stop there.

Mayor Helps was not alone in pursuing the rapid bike lane growth in the city. Believe it or not, there is a staff at city that consults and advises. In fact, in the fall of 2019 there was a call for input on the Richardson bike lanes by that very staff.

I’m not a defender of Mayor Helps, just a mere observer. But with just a few moments of your time, a Google search lets you uncover the fascinating world of municipal politics and the voting patterns of all the current council members on the bike lane additions.

I think you may well be surprised to see just who has been variously opposed or in favour. So remember, this is how democracy works — on every level of our government. It’s not a one person show.

People are feeling stressed and fearful

Re: “Amid pandemic, hate is the dominant emotion being expressed,” comment, Aug. 13.

Whilst not saying Victoria, you are in the local paper! How about fear, stress, anxiety and being depressed. You are forgetting during this pandemic we worked together, volunteered, and donated.

If fear and anxiety are projected as anger, you have translated to hate to stop the democratic right to express how we are feeling. Many have lost income, family members and dealing with huge demands on their emotional wellbeing. Long months of lockdown and giving up all our old norms.

Only now to see abuse of our green space, and not even feeling safe in our homes. Even with our personal safety, we cannot take it for granted any more..

In search of peace and quiet

I am wondering where I can go to find peace and quiet because the parks and beaches are inundated with irresponsible pet owners and their unleashed dogs. It’s not that I dislike dogs but I don’t know their dogs and when they come running up to me, sometimes jumping up on me, I do get afraid.

In these times of COVID-19, I need to de-stress in nature and it seems so unfair that I can’t do that without feeling uncomfortable and sometimes afraid.

The dogs also chase and frighten shore birds, which is upsetting to watch.

Then there is also the issue of many plastic dog poop bags that I come across either sticking out of the sand, thrown in the bushes or, worse, into the ocean and lakes.

Make sure your car’s wheel nuts are tight

When I read about the car that lost a wheel because somebody loosened the wheel nuts, I was shocked. But I also wondered how the driver didn’t notice the problem.

A number of years ago a friend of mine rotated his tires and forgot to snug up the nuts on one wheel. Due to the noise coming from the loose wheel he quickly pulled over and discovered the issue.

Whenever you hear odd noises coming from your car, don’t ignore them. Wheel nuts can come loose for a number of reasons, or it could be a wheel bearing failing, both of which could result in you losing a wheel.

So when you hear weird noises, stop and figure out why or call a professional. Ignoring such noises never ends well.

Get back to the way we were behaving, people, as we are going in the wrong direction.

To the young people who feel their lives have been too constricted, your partying is costing lives and people’s suffering. Let’s hope that some of the growing numbers aren’t your friends and family.

Community events should be banned

So, as was the case after Canada Day, the COVID-19 incubation period following the August long weekend, seems to have now resulted in a spike in new cases “from community events.”

Will the premier and health officials do the logical thing and ban community events for Labour Day — distasteful as that is — or are they comfortable with “it is what it is”?

People with intellectual disabilities may, like the general population, have mental health issues; however, they are more often living with Down’s Syndrome, cerebral palsy or other significant brain injuries.

When these institutions were closed their residents were successfully accommodated in their local communities with their families or in community living facilities with appropriate living and life supports.

Back to school with tents across the street

I live in James Bay and have experienced the effects of the tent encampment in Beacon Hill Park.

I agree the homeless problem is the result of gaps in our social safety net.

Classes will resume in September at South Park school under the cloud of the pandemic. The situation across Douglas Street from the school is another reason the encampment must be moved.

Children, in some cases starting school for the first time, are the most vulnerable members of our society. The stress, risk and danger to children attending South Park needs to be mitigated.

If even one child is injured or scared by the encampment residents, we have all failed.

Vandalism needs to be condemned

The B.C. border has not been closed by public health authorities. All Canadians including Albertans have the right to travel in B.C. while abiding by local public health protocols without being subject to vandalism and harassment.

B.C. residents who vandalize vehicles of Albertans in B.C. are committing crimes.

Premier John Horgan’s failure to condemn such crimes and harassment by some B.C. residents and his absurd admonishment to Albertans to change their licence plates or use public transit is appalling and irresponsible.

It is a Trump-style dog whistle condoning acts of vandalism and harassment by B.C. residents against Albertans.

Horgan fails to heed the advice of health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, to “be kind, be calm, be safe.”

Horgan and many B.C. residents suffer from the delusion that B.C. is for the exclusive benefit of B.C. residents.

Horgan’s statements reflect a parochial politician risen to the level of his own incompetence and they reflect what is wrong with Canada.

There has been a long standing and ongoing failure of leadership by the prime minister and provincial premiers in finding any national purpose or interest beyond the backyards of provinces.

So long as premiers like Horgan are in office, Canada is no more than a confederation of provincial backyards.

Michelaine Lahaie, chair of the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for RCMP, says a video shows an RCMP officer opening the door of a moving police vehicle, which hits the man.

The officer and other Mounties then use force to arrest him while he's on the ground.

Lahaie says the man was then injured in an alleged assault by another detained man in a cell at the Kinngait RCMP detachment and had to be flown to Iqaluit for medical treatment.

She says the investigation is to determine whether the conduct of the Mounties, including use of force, was reasonable.

She says in a news release that the probe will be a Public Interest Investigation into the conduct of RCMP in Kinngait.

""The RCMP members' conduct will be assessed in accordance with relevant law and RCMP policy,"" reads the terms of reference of the investigation released Tuesday.

""Consideration will also be given as to whether racial bias and/or discrimination played a role in the man's arrest and subsequent treatment.""

Lahaie noted the review she has requested by the commission is separate from an investigation by the Ottawa Police Service at the request of the Mounties and an RCMP internal Code of Conduct review.

""I am concerned with the conduct of RCMP members involved in this serious incident and will monitor both the OPS (Ottawa police) investigation and the RCMP's Code of Conduct investigation,"" Lahaie said in a release.

""The CRCC's investigation will provide an added level of scrutiny to the incident, as it will additionally examine the circumstances that led to the man being placed in a cell at the RCMP detachment where another detainee assaulted him and he needed to be airlifted to Iqaluit for treatment.

""I am aware that there is historical distrust by Inuit toward the police and I am committed to increasing RCMP accountability.""

The day after the man's arrest Nunavut Justice Minister Jeannie Ehaloak said she was outraged.

""I have seen the video from Kinngait circulating on social media and am very concerned by the unnecessary force, the violence and the lack of respect I have seen,'' she said in a release at the time.

""Nunavummiut should not fear this kind of treatment and disregard for safety and basic rights.''

Ehaloak said she would formally request a review by the commission.

Quote — ""Prorogation of a session brings to an end all proceedings before Parliament. With certain exceptions, unfinished business 'dies' on the Order Paper and must be started anew in a subsequent session."" — House of Commons Procedure and Practice, Third Edition, 2017.

Length — Prorogation can be as short as a few hours, or as long as several months. During this period, the House of Commons and Senate are shut down but the government remains in power and MPs remain MPs.

Frequency — Most Parliaments are prorogued at least once and often there are several prorogations and sessions in the life of a Parliament.

Authority — Prorogation is ordered by the Governor General on the advice of the prime minister. It is not covered by statute. Rather it is a personal legal power of the Governor General and by convention the prime minister has the right to provide advice. And by convention it's actually the prime minister's decision.

Granted — Prorogation is routinely granted. In December 2008, then-governor general Michaelle Jean took a few hours before granting prorogation, but that was a thorny case because opposition parties were threatening to defeat the government and install a coalition government shortly after an election.

Ceremony — At one time, prorogation was done in a formal ceremony in the Senate chamber, but that hasn't been used in decades. A simple proclamation signed by the Governor General does the trick today.

Liberal promise — In their 2015 election platform, the Liberals said Stephen Harper's Conservatives ""used prorogation to avoid difficult political circumstances. We will not.""

Limits — Governments can't use prorogation to shut down Parliament indefinitely. That would violate the constitutional requirement that Parliament meet at least once every 12 months. And without Parliament to approve a budget and spending estimates, the government would run out of money.

John McCain of Arizona.

She’s just the latest Republican to join in the convention, after a number of notable GOP former elected officials — including former Ohio Gov. John Kasich — endorsed the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee on Monday night. It's a continuation of a major theme that Democrats have pushed through the first night of the convention — an effort to broaden the party's appeal to occasional Republicans and disaffected Trump voters.

In an advance clip from the video shared with The Associated Press, Cindy McCain talks about how Biden, then a Delaware senator, met her husband when John McCain was assigned to be a military aide for him on a trip overseas. The two became friends, and the families would gather for picnics in the Bidens’ backyard.

""They would just sit and joke. It was like a comedy show, sometimes, to watch the two of them,"" she says in the clip.

Cindy McCain is not expected to offer an explicit endorsement, but her involvement in the video is her biggest public show of support yet for Biden’s candidacy. McCain was the 2008 Republican presidential nominee against Democrat Barack Obama, who won the election with Biden as his vice-presidential running mate.

Both Cindy McCain and her daughter Meghan have been outspoken critics of President Donald Trump, and the family is longtime friends with the Bidens. Trump targeted John McCain personally in 2015, saying the former prisoner of war wasn't a hero ""because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured."" McCain later angered Trump with his dramatic thumbs-down vote against repealing President Barack Obama’s health care law.

When McCain died on a Saturday in 2018, the Trump administration lowered the American flag over the White House to half-staff but then raised it by Monday. After public outcry, the White House flags were again lowered. Trump wasn't invite to McCain's funeral.

Biden consoled Meghan McCain on an appearance on ""The View"" after her father was diagnosed with the cancer that eventually took his life. She has said Biden often reaches out to her to offer support, after losing his own son Beau to the same cancer in 2015.

But while Meghan suggested in April she’d be voting for Biden, Cindy has pointedly stayed out of the presidential race. In April of last year, amid rumours that the McCains would wade into the election in support of Biden, Cindy McCain tweeted that Biden is ""a wonderful man and a dear friend of the McCain family.""

""However,"" she added at the time, ""I have no intention of getting involved in presidential politics.""

The video on Biden's friendship with McCain is one of a series of short documentaries created by Oscar Award-winning director Davis Guggenheim, who worked on ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" the 2006 documentary on climate change that featured former Vice-President Al Gore. On Monday night, Guggenheim’s short film focused on Biden’s relationship with the Amtrak conductor and workers on the trains he took from Delaware to Washington as senator aired during the convention."

University president the Rev. John Jenkins said there have been 147 confirmed cases of coronavirus on campus since the start of classes for the university’s approximately 12,000 students.

Jenkins said he decided against sending students home after consulting with the St. Joseph County Health Department. Instead, university officials decided steps could be taken short of closing the campus while still protecting students' health and safety.

The university is advising off-campus students not to visit the campus and on-campus students not to venture off-campus and is restricting student gatherings to 10 people or less. The university is allowing graduate student access to research laboratories and libraries. Athletic teams subject to surveillance testing can continue to gather for sanctioned activities, but will be closely monitored.

""The virus is a formidable foe,"" Jenkins said in announcing enhanced testing for students experiencing symptoms and surveillance testing for those without symptoms. ""For the past week, it has been winning. Let us as the Fighting Irish join together to contain it.""

According to Jenkins, the university has traced the spike in COVID-19 cases to off-campus gatherings where neither masks were worn nor physical distancing observed. He said students infected at those gatherings passed it on to others, who in turn passed the virus on to others, resulting in the positive cases, with all but one a student.

Jenkins asked students to help in identifying others who have been flagrantly violating safety protocols.

The action by Notre Dame follows the decision by officials of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to switch to remote learning starting Wednesday, and is making arrangements for students who want to leave campus housing. UNC officials said clusters of COVID-19 were discovered in dorms, a fraternity house and other student housing.

Coronavirus outbreaks earlier this summer at fraternities in Washington state, California and Mississippi provided a glimpse of the challenges school officials face in keeping the virus from spreading on campuses where young people gather in close quarters.

The virus has been blamed for over 170,000 deaths and 5.4 million confirmed infections in the U.S."

As Democrats gathered virtually, Trump targeted voters in a pair of key swing states and sought to curry favour with women voters by pardoning Susan B. Anthony, a leader in the women’s suffrage movement.

In Arizona, one of the top 2020 battleground states, the president sought to paint a Biden victory in apocalyptic terms, insisting ""the survival of our nation is at stake"" in November, as he slammed what he hyperbolically labeled the ""insane and lethal policies"" of his opposition.

""Biden’s plan is the most radical, extreme, reckless, dangerous and deadly immigration plan ever put forward by a major party candidate,"" he said. ""It must be defeated. and it will be defeated on November 3.""

Trump repeatedly mischaracterized Biden’s views on immigration, which are more centrist than many others in his party. Biden, for instance, does not support abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and he argues that crossing the U.S. border illegally should be criminally prosecuted rather than made a civil offence, as many other top Democratic presidential hopefuls proposed.

With his second campaign trip in two days, Trump was hoping to halt an expected convention polling bump for his rival and shore up support with his focus on immigration, one of the most important issues to his political base. He was also trying to stanch an erosion in support among female voters with a symbolic nod on the centennial of the ratification of the 19th Amendment.

In recent weeks, Trump has been trying to build support within the pivotal female voter constituency and has stepped up his events aimed at women. His campaign has launched another ""women for Trump"" bus tour, and the president has embraced a ""law and order"" message with renewed vigour.

The president also worked in a last-minute stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, for a briefing about damage from the derecho last week that has left thousands without power and caused catastrophic damage across the battleground state. Many there have expressed outrage that their plight has not received more national attention.

The storm, which packed 100 mph winds and similar power to an inland hurricane, blew down trees, flipped vehicles and caused widespread damage.

""We’ve come through for you, and we will always come through for Iowa,"" Trump said, as the city's mayor urged him to consider enhanced federal disaster funding for people there.

Trump highlighted his immigration agenda during his stop in Yuma, and got an update on construction of his southern border wall. The president insisted that, in addition to fulfilling his pledge to build the wall, Mexico was also paying for it — even though they’re not.

""They are paying for it,"" he said as he stood in front of a replica of his wall, telling reporters he’s planning to enact a border crossing toll at some point in the future.

""Mexico will be paying,"" he said. ""We’re figuring how much we have to charge.""

Before leaving Washington, Trump held a White House event to announce the pardon of Anthony, convicted of voting in 1872 in violation of laws permitting only men to vote. But he quickly pivoted to the upcoming election and the issue of voting by mail.

""Win, lose or draw, we have to get it right,"" Trump said of the November vote count, levelling a fresh offensive against mail-in voting.

""You can’t have millions and millions of ballots sent all over the place, sent to people that are dead, sent to dogs, cats, sent everywhere,"" Trump said.

In fact, voter fraud has proved exceedingly rare. The Brennan Center for Justice in 2017 ranked the risk of ballot fraud at 0.00004% to 0.0009%, based on studies of past elections.

Only nine states have plans for ""universal"" mail-in voting, in which ballots are sent automatically to registered voters. Five of those states relied on mail-in ballots even before the coronavirus pandemic raised concerns about voting in person.

Trump's pardon announcement came on the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which ensured women the right to vote. The amendment states, ""The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex."" Congress passed it in 1919, and the amendment was ratified on Aug. 18, 1920.

Anthony was arrested for voting in Rochester, New York, and convicted in a widely publicized trial. Although she refused to pay the fine, the authorities declined to take further action.

""She felt the trial was the greatest miscarriage of justice because she had not had an opportunity to have a jury of her peers, and the jury didn’t get to vote,"" according to Deborah L. Hughes, president and CEO of The National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House in Rochester, where Anthony died in 1906.

""So to pardon her is to validate the trial, and she would not buy that idea at all,"" Hughes said.

Hughes said the question to ask on the anniversary is how she would want to be honoured. ""She would be the first to say if any president wanted to honour her, the best way to do that is to make sure there is no voter suppression anywhere in the United States,"" Hughes said.

Preparations for Trump's own acceptance speech next week were under way at the White House, where a stage was being erected on the South Lawn.

As was the case Monday in Minnesota and Wisconsin, Trump did not venture beyond the airports in Iowa or Arizona — a reflection of the new realities of campaigning in the midst of a pandemic. But Trump's Yuma rally felt much like his rallies of old, with a tightly packed crowd of hundreds shouting and cheering — though many were wearing ""TRUMP"" and ""MAGA"" masks.

“The majority of new infections in B.C. at this time are among young adults,” people who may have relatively mild infections but who can inadvertently spread it to more vulnerable populations, Gustafson said. “It is very important to remember that for our elders and those with underlying health conditions, the potential for severe disease remains. This may not apply to you, but you could easily spread the virus to someone who is vulnerable through your work or when spending time with friends and family.”

In B.C., 2,286 people are under public health monitoring for symptoms.

“Today we have a number of active outbreaks and community clusters and our public health teams on the ground are very proactively managing and following up these outbreaks, notifying close contacts, and doing all they can to break the chain of infection, but for us to be successful we actually need everybody to help,”Gustafson said.

From Friday to Monday the province announced 100 new cases — the second highest recorded number of single-day cases since the pandemic began, said B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix. There were 88 cases from Saturday to Sunday, and 48 cases Sunday to Monday, for a total of 236 people who have tested positive for COVID-19 in B.C.

Of the 4,594 cases in the province to date, there have been 1,419 cases in Vancouver Coastal Health, 2,425 cases in the Fraser Health Authority, 154 cases on Vancouver Island, 405 in the Interior Health Authority, and 117 in Northern Health Authority. Of those cases, 3,653 people have recovered.

On Monday, four people with COVID-19 were in hospital. Two new deaths, both in the Fraser Health region, were reported on for a total of 198 to date.

“I wanted to start on behalf of the premier, of the government, I think, all people in B.C., to send out our condolences to the families of the two people who died from Saturday to Sunday of COVID-19 in B.C., and to the 198 families in total, the 196 other families who’ve lost loved ones during the pandemic,” said Dix. “It is an extraordinarily difficult time right now to grieve.”

Dix said he spent the weekend engaged with young people, encouraging them to influence one another to do their part in not spreading COVID-19 “because this pandemic is not ending soon.

“This pandemic that we are all tired of, so very tired of, will be going on now, we would expect, will through 2021, into 2022,” said Dix.

“This new normal’s going to be in place for a long time and the way that we address that, the way we deal with that … has to be by choice and by engagement and by talking to each other and by encouraging one another and when we fall, helping one another up,” said Dix.

There are two new outbreaks in the health care system, in the Czorny Alzheimer Centre in the Fraser Health region, and the Arbutus Care Centre in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, for a total of 10 — nine in long-term care facilities and assisted living and one in acute care. There are no outbreaks in long-term care facilities on Vancouver Island.

On Friday, 7-Eleven announced an employee at its store on 1327 Douglas St., on the corner of Douglas and Johnson streets. Patrons in the store between Aug. 10 and Aug. 14 were asked to self monitor and call HealthLink BC at 811 for information.

The case of the7-Eleven employee was not addressed in the public update by the deputy provincial health officer on Monday and the Health Ministry could not be contacted for comment. Island Health has not issued an advisory. The store was open on Monday.

This weekend, Northern Health issued a community exposure alert for anyone who may have attended the It Is Time Canada event in Deadwood, Alta., from July 30 to Aug. 2. Attendees are asked to self-isolate for 14 days and monitor for symptoms.

The dry lightning came with little moisture and after record-breaking weekend temperatures that left forests tinder dry, said Dorthe Jakobsen, spokeswoman for the B.C. Wildfire Service’s coastal region.

High temperatures are expected to continue until Thursday and the wildfire risk is considered extremely high.

Most of the fires, including blazes at Mount Healey and the Sooke Lake Reservoir area where Greater Victoria draws its water supply, were about one to four hectares in size on Monday afternoon. By late Monday, the Wildfire Service was reporting eight small wildfires around Sooke.

The Capital Regional District said residents may see smoke and air tankers in the vicinity while B.C. Wildfire and watershed protection crews “contain and supress two small wildfires” on a ridge top around the reservoir.

The CRD said there was no threat to water quality or infrastructure. “Multiple crews and aircraft are busy assessing,” a statement said. “Though smoke may be visible, the wildfires are currently small … the largest is four hectares.”

Initial response crews were travelling to the sites to assess the fires and fight them, Jakobsen said.

All of the new fires are south of Nanaimo, including a 2.5-hectare blaze at Meade Creek and four other fires north of Lake Cowichan, including Holland Lake. One of the blazes is close to Laketown Ranch in Youbou, site of the Laketown Shakedown music festival. The owners were on high alert as the fire was only about six kilometres away.

A lightning strike is believed to be the cause of a blaze near Muir Creek, west of Sooke, while there is a fire of unknown cause near Shirley. Lightning also sparked a blaze in a remote area of the San Juan Valley and the Bear Creek Reservoir north of Jordan River.

Several mid-Island fire departments worked on dousing a small brush fire in the Ladysmith area that was reported Sunday.

The fire is in a forested area near where Oyster Sto’Lo Road and the Trans-Canada Highway meet. The fire is believed to be a minor one, as the affected area of the forest is estimated less than one hectare.

“If it went unmanaged, of course it could become something significant,” said Mike Primrose of Ladysmith Volunteer Fire Department. “But they were on it pretty quick.”

The North Cedar Fire Department, Ladysmith Volunteer Fire Department, and the B.C. Wildfire Service all responded to the mutual-aid call.

Jakobsen said attack crews from the North Island, where there are no new fires, could be called south if the fires grow in size.

Environment Canada estimates there were about 1,600 lightning strikes across the province over the 12-hour period starting at 5 p.m. Sunday.

The B.C. Wildfire Service said there have been 415 fires across B.C. since April, burning a total area of 910 hectares. That includes 76 fires in the coastal region scorching 272 hectares.

The forecast calls for several more days of high temperatures before a large weather system brings rainfall on Thursday and Friday through much of the southern areas of the province, Jakobsen said.

Heat warnings remained in place Monday night for the Fraser Canyon, as well as the Okanagan, North and South Thompson, Cariboo and 100 Mile regions.

Environment Canada said 13 temperature records were broken or tied across southern B.C. on Sunday. The Fraser Canyon community of Lytton was the hot spot in Canada at 41.2 C, which broke the old record of 40.4 set 12 years ago.

One Island location set a new record on Sunday. Estevan Point on the Hesquiat Peninsula on the Island’s west coast hit 23.7 C, slightly higher than the previous mark set in 2012.

That’s because as juveniles, the fish experienced warmer-than-average river temperatures in the Fraser River.
But this year, especially and similar to last year, marine survival has been very low,” Michielsens said.
The Fraser River in good years has seen tens of millions of sockeye return, sustaining First Nations and commercial and recreational fisheries and their coastal communities.
A total 30,000 salmon have been counted above the slide, about 30 per cent of which are expected to be sockeye, Michielsens said.","The good news for this year’s troubled Fraser River salmon stocks is that high levels of freshwater run-off have been dropping in recent days, giving returning fish a better chance of making it past the Big Bar slide and to their home streams to spawn. But that boost is unlikely to offset the historically low return of 283,000 sockeye forecast for the run this year.

“Overall, the situation is quite dire. The run is returning at low levels,” said Catherine Michielsens, chief of fisheries management science for the Canada-U.S. Pacific Salmon Commission.

“We have now seen enough of the run already to not expect any major surprises in terms of numbers being very different.”

It was already known that survival rates for this year’s Fraser River sockeye stocks would be below average, Michielsens said from Vancouver Thursday. That’s because as juveniles, the fish experienced warmer-than-average river temperatures in the Fraser River. They also faced above-average discharge levels in the river, making it more difficult to reach the ocean, she said. In the ocean, poor environmental conditions affecting their prey in the northeast Pacific hurt their survival rates as well.

“There’s a substantial decline in salmon productivity and that’s been occurring for quite a while. But this year, especially and similar to last year, marine survival has been very low,” Michielsens said.

The Fraser River in good years has seen tens of millions of sockeye return, sustaining First Nations and commercial and recreational fisheries and their coastal communities.

But there are no fisheries this year for Fraser River-bound sockeye because of conservation concerns.

The current low forecast follows last year’s previous historic low return of 485,900.

In 2018, a dominant cycle year for sockeye, which are on a four-year cycle, close to 11 million returned to the Fraser River, allowing for a total catch of 5.9 million fish.

So far this season, 65,000 sockeye and chinook salmon have been counted in the river below the Big Bar slide, 64 kilometres north of Lillooet.

A total 30,000 salmon have been counted above the slide, about 30 per cent of which are expected to be sockeye, Michielsens said.

The slide, reported in June last year, resulted in more than 85,000 cubic metres of rock shearing off a cliff into the river, where salmon were trapped below a five-metre tall waterfall. A natural fishway was built over the winter to allow salmon around the slide area.

Because discharge levels have dropped substantially in the past few days, the new fishway has been “successful at this point at allowing both sockeye and chinook to migrate above the side,” Michielsens said.

As well, a new salmon cannon will carry salmon past Big Bar. About 5,300 salmon have used the cannon this season and another 1,500 have been carried by truck, Michielsens said.

Tailored Brands, which also owns Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank stores, said over the weekend it will continue to operate most stores during restructuring and expected to reduce its funded debt by $630 million.

COVID-19 restrictions have severely limited weddings and office work since March, hitting the clothing retail and rental sectors particularly hard.

The three Island stores — including Nanaimo’s Brook’s Landing Mall and Westshore Town Centre in Langford — were shut down in March and reopened with reduced staff in late June.

Lawrence Larsen, manager of the Uptown store, said the three Island locations will continue to operate.

At least two stores — both in Surrey — have not reopened.

Larsen said the Uptown location is operating without 40 per cent of its usual staff.

He said sales since reopening have been “consistent, but overall the business is really down” from previous years.

Dinesh Lathi, chief executive of Tailored Brands, said in a statement to clients over the weekend the pandemic has altered the way people live and work.

“It means fewer in-person meetings, wedding celebrations and special events. Simply put, people are staying home more, and our clothes are better suited to being out and about,” Lathi said.

He said the company is “making major shifts” by creating a leaner structure to adapt to the realities of today’s retail environment.

“In July, we announced some store closures. However, we will continue to have stores across Canada operating as usual. Nothing about our decision to seek Chapter 11 protection changes that.”

Meanwhile, Lord & Taylor, the oldest retailer in the U.S., also said it was seeking bankruptcy protection over the weekend, lengthening the list of major retail chains that have faltered during the pandemic.

Household names, many longtime anchors in malls, were already struggling to keep up with consumers moving to online sales.

Lord & Taylor, which began as a Manhattan dry goods store in 1824, was sold to the French rental clothing company Le Tote Inc. last year. Both filed for bankruptcy protection, separately, on Sunday.

Lord & Taylor says it’s looking for a buyer.

Tailored Brands was struggling even before the pandemic lockdowns smothered any demand for suits or ties.

It wasn’t alone.

Last month, Brooks Brothers, the 200-year-old company that dressed nearly every U.S. president, filed for bankruptcy protection. Its rival, Barneys New York, is being dismantled after filing for bankruptcy last year.

Dozens of retailers, big and small, have filed for U.S. Chapter 11 protection this year. The pace through the first half of 2020 far exceeds the number of retail bankruptcies for all of last year. About two dozen U.S.-based chains have sought bankruptcy protection since the pandemic started.

Others include J. Crew, J.C. Penney, Neiman Marcus, Stage Stores, and Ascena Retail Group, which owns Lane Bryant in addition to Ann Taylor.

The five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations are upset that Ottawa decided to give a surplus allocation of salmon — which arose this year due to reduced recreational fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic — to commercial fishers rather than to the First Nations.

Clifford Atleo, lead negotiator for one of the nations who is also called Wickaninnish, says he feels sports and commercial troll fishers are given more rights to fish in the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

He says the latest decision to shut First Nations fishers out of an opportunity to catch more chinook salmon this year shows systemic racism is ""alive and well"" within the federal fisheries department.

""We feel very strongly we're not being dealt with fairly, we know we're not being dealt with fairly,"" Atleo said.

""It's just another layer of disappointment on the part of how the government deals with us. The government doesn't realize that their attitude toward our people is dyed-in-the-wool ... And I think the government — sometimes they don't realize they're being racist. They've got age-old policies that have never changed.""

A 2018 B.C. Supreme Court ruling directed Ottawa to take a more ""generous approach"" to allocations of chinook salmon to the First Nations given the importance of this species to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people.

The ruling from B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Humphries noted that the government's salmon allocation policy at the time gave recreational fisherman priority to fish for chinook and soho salmon ahead of the First Nations and advised the fisheries minister to reassess this policy.

Despite this ruling and changes that have since placed the First Nations at a higher priority than sport fishers, the Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ehattesaht and Mowachaht/Muchalaht nations say their yearly fishing allocations have not increased.

This year, the five First Nations were told they could fish 7,724 chinook, which amounts to just 1.5 fish per person for the 5,000 members of their communities.

COVID-19 brought a new dynamic to the salmon allocations this year, as fewer sport fishers were able to come due to pandemic restrictions. This means the recreational fleet is expected to catch 15,000 less salmon than was forecasted for this year, according to figures provided by the department.

None of this surplus is going to the First Nations.

""As per approved management plans, the Area G (commercial) harvest is adjusted based on the projected recreational harvests which results in an increase of 15,000 for 2020,"" said department spokesperson Athina Vazeos.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan was unavailable for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Jennifer Kuss, noted the improvements made in giving the five nations a higher priority in the yearly salmon catch allocations, as directed by the courts.

""This change ensures that food, social, and ceremonial (fishing) continues to be prioritized first, and additionally prioritizes the Five Nations rights-based sale fishery over the recreational and commercial fishery,"" Kuss said in a statement.

The Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations argue Ottawa could have provided some of the unused catch from this year to their people to help them support their remote communities. But Atleo said fisheries officials would not even engage in discussions about it.

""The government is trying to say they consult with us, they negotiate with us. They create their fishing plans, put it on the table and it's like take or leave it,"" Atleo said.

""All we want to do is be part of the economy, part of looking after ourselves without depending on government. We don't think that's a lot to ask.""

NDP MP Gord Johns, whose riding takes in the West Coast fishing shores, said he finds it ""disgusting"" the Trudeau government has repeatedly highlighted its desire to restore the Crown's relationship with Indigenous Peoples but has still fought many legal battles with these nations over their fishing rights.

""Indigenous people in our communities rely on this fishery for their economy, for their food security, for their culture. It's part of their way of life. These are salt water people and they rely on the salmon and to be denied their right is shameful, it's disgusting that the government is taking this approach.""

The First Nations are calling on Ottawa to revisit its decision on the surplus salmon for this year to allow them a portion of the additional catch.

""The government has an opportunity to fix this with these (surplus salmon) to come with a fair opportunity to exercise their commitment, in the judge's words, for a generous allocation to the nations and to start moving forward with reconciliation,"" Johns said.

The minister's spokeswoman says Jordan takes any allegations of systemic racism ""very seriously"" and that Ottawa is working with the five nations on a reconciliation agreement on fisheries resources, which is intended to broaden their access in the area, Kuss said.

""The road to reconciliation is a long journey, and Canada is committed to moving forward together. The department has spoken with the five nations on the reallocation of (salmon catch) on multiple occasions and that open dialogue will continue.""

The company already accepts credit cards. But having the tap function for both debit and credit cards is new. Passengers will also be able to use Apple Pay and Google Pay on smartphones, B.C. Ferries spokesperson Tessa Humphries said.

New PIN pads are being installed throughout B.C. Ferries operations this spring, with smaller terminals first to get the new technology.

“The larger terminals will happen towards the end of the month but by the end of March, we do expect to have debit ability at all the terminals,” Humphries said.

“We are aware and recognize that it [debit payment] is something that customers have been asking for quite some time and so we are excited that we can improve that experience and offer more payment options.”

B.C. Ferries anticipates ticketing will take less time for customers using the tap option, which has a $100 limit.

Credit cards — Visa, MasterCard and American Express — are already accepted for fares. Credit and debit cards can also be used on board the vessels.

B.C. Ferries starting offered a debit option on ferries in fall 2018.

Using debit for fares has not previously been available to passengers on major routes although it has been offered for northern routes which require reservations, Humphries said.

But with the busy southern routes, a debit option without a tap would have added a couple of seconds per transaction. On a long weekend or during the popular summer season, those seconds could add up to delays at terminals, she said.

“So we wanted to make sure that we did this right and that we allowed for pin pads that had the tap and pay capability before we rolled it out fleetwide,” Humphries said.

B.C. Ferries did tests that found between 75% and 80% of transactions fall under the $100 limit, she said.

The cost of adopting the new PIN pads is not being released, she said.

Debit is also an option now at certain smaller terminals and at self-service ticketing kiosks for foot passengers.

Smaller terminals already accepting debit for fare purchase are at Mill Bay, Brentwood Bay, Port Hardy, McLoughlin Bay (Bella Bella), Prince Rupert and Skidegate.

Self-service kiosks for walk-ons are at Tsawwassen, Swartz Bay, Horseshoe Bay, Departure Bay, Duke Point and Campbell River.

B.C. Ferries carries more than 22 million passengers and eight million vehicles annually. It has 37 vessels in its fleet, using 47 terminals.

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

""It was nice to get on the board tonight,"" said O'Reilly.

""I haven't been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it's just one game. I've got to be consistent with it.""

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

""When we take care of the puck it's effective and it's hard on them,"" said O'Reilly.

""I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We've got to stick to our structure.""

Pietrangelo said they've been working on fixing the penalty kill.

""We've been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,"" he said.

""Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.""

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

""They're blocking a lot of shots, they're studying us. They kind of know what we're doing,"" said Miller.

He said they'll make adjustments but aren't going to go back to square one.

""We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,"" he said.

""It's not like we're getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They're a good team. We're a good team. It's going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.""

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O'Reilly, last year's Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play — the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O'Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O'Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler's stick and in.

O'Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

All Western Conference games are being played in front of no fans at Rogers Place. The players are being kept isolated in a so-called bubble between games to prevent contracting COVID-19.

His journey to recovery started in earnest on that lonely stretch of highway.

""My brother really had to talk me off the ledge,"" Clune said. ""When I see his face and when I see my other brother Ben's face, that's what gave me strength to live, because I didn't really want to live for myself at that time.

""Matt, at a couple points on that drive, had to do things that no younger brother should have to do and really dig down deep and get me home.""

The documentary from Taylor Prestidge and Haris Usanovic of Upper Canada Films tracks Clune's life and career, recovery and redemption. It includes interviews with Clune's parents, brothers, teammates and coaches.

Clune was driven to be the best as a child, but the pressure led him down a dark path at early age.

""I made that decision I was going to put my head down and not see anything but being a hockey player,"" Clune, who was selected in the third round of the 2005 NHL draft by the Dallas Stars, says in the film.

He began to try alcohol in his early teens as a way to cope, and it escalated quickly once he got to high school and then the Ontario Hockey League.

""I had this hole inside me that made me insecure and afraid of the world,"" Clune recounts. ""I got wasted and was like, 'Wow. OK. I'll be able to do this. I can cope with this. It's like a warm blanket.'

""Alcohol saved me. It was my solution to that problem of being self-absorbed and focused on all the things that made me insecure and self-conscious and in pain and sad.""

But he didn't realize how much of a spiral his life was taking. In junior, he would drive from bar to bar, party to party, drinking, smoking marjiuana and doing cocaine.

""I wanted to walk that line of looking death in the face every day, but still play hockey and do all these things,"" Clune says in the film. ""I don't know how I did it.""

Things got worse after junior when he was living in the United States by himself before making his NHL debut in that fateful 2009-10 season, months before becoming completely unglued.

""I had achieved my goal,"" he recalls on screen. ""But I hated myself.""

Clune eventually checked into rehab a second time — he went once before, but didn't stay — and committed to getting better with a lot of help from the people around him.

After he got out, he resumed his career and went onto play a total of 120 regular-season games in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Nashville Predators. His contract was bought out in 2015, and he was again at a crossroads — retire or keep going.

That's when the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were in the early stages of their massive rebuild, came calling to see if Clune wanted to be part of their program. They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club. At the very least, he would play in the minors and help foster a new culture.

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, who was in charge of the minor-league Marlies at the time, saw something in Clune that could be useful.

""He provides a certain energy,"" Dubas said. ""He provides experience in his life that I thought brought a great spirit to our team.""

Clune played 19 games with Leafs, but the forward truly made his mark with the Marlies. He helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018 and plans to continue his on-ice career, but equally important was how he's helped mentor a number of current NHLers.

He's proud of where he is, and not shy talking about how he got there. Clune still goes to meetings, does the 12 steps and now works to help others.

He also thinks a lot about why he made the decision to live, to fight, and get better, when many others — including some fellow pro hockey players — have gone down a different path.

""In the beginning, it was because I wanted to see my brothers,"" said Clune, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Then it transformed into wanting to live for myself. I started to discover what it feels like to have self esteem and to have love.

""I just hope people realize that they're not alone with how they feel. Don't be afraid to ask for help.""

And that includes how to allow players under contract to CFL teams the ability to sign elsewhere — most notably the NFL — if the opportunity arises. On Monday, the CFL cancelled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The focus right now for us on a few certain things and one of them is ensuring if there's an ability for our players to receive some form of payment this year,"" Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA's executive director, said Monday during a conference call. ""They should be able to do that if they have an opportunity.""

While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season. However, 66 players have currently opted out of participating in the 2020 campaign, which could create opportunity for some CFL players to sign deals south of the border and have a chance to earn a football paycheque, either on the active roster or on the practice squad.

While there's no shortage of collegiate players available, the advantage a CFL player has is pro experience, a fact not lost upon NFL personnel people.

The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign. This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.

And players on NFL practice rosters receive at least US$8,000 per week.

Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the CFL is amendable to doing what it can to help its players.

""Where we can do something we will,"" he said. ""We're going to be committed to working towards good outcomes, the best possible outcomes we can have with out players.

""That's not going to mean we're going to be able to do everything but we're certainly going to go into this with a real positive spirit.""

Something else that will be on the CFL-CFLPA radar will be the current collective bargaining agreement, which is slated to expire after the 2021 season. But union president Solomon Elimimian said the two sides covered a lot of ground this time around during talks to amend the agreement for a shortened '20 season.

""Whether we deal with '21 when it comes or after the '21 season I think there's hope there that we can work together,"" Elimimian said. ""Obviously the relationship between the players and the league needs to be one where the players feel appreciated.

""Everyone wants to the league to reach its full potential. The partnership has to be one that's very genuine and the players have to feel part of that. If that happens, the sky is the limit.""

Cavan Biggio also went deep for the Blue Jays and finished with three hits and three RBIs.

Ryu (2-1) struck out three and walked none. The left-hander permitted only one runner past second base and yielded just one extra-base hit to a team that came in ranked second in the majors with a .467 slugging percentage.

Rather than vie for strikeouts, Ryu said he was focused more on getting the Orioles to hit the ball weakly.

""I was able to keep them off balance,"" he said through an interpreter.

Signed in December to an $80 million, four-year contract, Ryu got off to a shaky start with Toronto in July before showing the form he displayed as a star with the Dodgers. He's given up a total of two runs in his last three starts after allowing eight runs over nine innings in his first two outings.

""That was vintage Ryu,"" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. ""Ryu was outstanding. That's the reason we won the game.""

The two home runs were a factor, but mostly Ryu was the difference-maker.

""They didn’t give Ryu that big contract for nothing,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""You just never know what he’s going to throw. You don’t know what side of the plate he’s going to throw to. He’s really tough on right-handers because he can locate it in. You saw a lot of us get jammed.""

The Blue Jays took control with a four-run third against Alex Cobb (1-2). Three infield hits produced a run before Grichuk delivered a three-run drive over the centre-field wall. It was his third home run of the season, all in the last four games.

""Obviously, the pitch to Grichuk was middle middle and it was a poorly executed pitch,"" Cobb said. ""But most of the pitches that I had, I felt like I executed. I got the results.""

Cobb gave up five runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He’s winless in his last four starts.

After hitting 31 homers last year, Grichuk was batting fifth, sixth or seventh in the order this season before Montoyo decided to move him into the No. 2 spot Sunday to replace injured Bo Bichette. Over the past two games, Grichuk has two homers, four hits and six RBIs.

Pedro Severino and Renato Núñez had RBIs for the Orioles, who have dropped two straight after winning seven of eight.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Bichette (right knee sprain) had an MRI and will receive a second opinion on his injury, Montoyo said. Bichette leads Toronto with a .361 batting average.

Orioles: RH Dillon Tate (elbow contusion) came off the injured list and RH Evan Phillips was optioned to the team's alternate site.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: RH Nate Pearson (0-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his fourth start in his first big league season Tuesday night. Drafted 28th overall in 2017, the 23-year-old is looking to rebound after giving up four runs to Miami last week in 2 1/3 innings. ""I'm developing at the highest level,"" Pearson said Monday. ""When I don't have my best stuff, I'm going to struggle.""

Orioles: LH Wade LeBlanc (1-0, 7.13) has allowed a combined 10 runs over 12 innings in his last three starts.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

""We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,"" Marchand said. ""That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.""

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

""We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do — little battles,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.""

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President's Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk's first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy's hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina's captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy putaway from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston's first six post-season games.

""There's other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.""

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen's late goal.

""That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,"" Williams said. ""We got it handed to us.""

NOTES: David Pastrnak had a goal and an assist in Boston’s double-overtime win in Game 1, but hasn’t played since. He had 48 regular-season goals to tie Washington’s Alex Ovechkin for the league lead. … Carolina played without 20-year-old Andrei Svechnikov, who was injured when his leg twisted awkwardly beneath him late in the third period of Saturday's loss. ... DeBrusk scored his 12th and 13th playoff goals since his 2018 post-season debut. … The Hurricanes were also without D Joel Edmundson for the third straight game. … Jake Gardiner assisted on Williams’ first-period goal for his first post-season point with Carolina.

As he explored and ate his way around that city-state, it brought back tasty memories of my travels there many years ago.

I, too, ate my way around Singapore and what I was most fond of was their many hawker centres. They are outdoor food courts with numerous stalls each offering a different Southeast Asian-style dish, such as chicken rice, fish-head curry and chili crab.

article continues below

But what I remember most vividly is the satay. Threading small, marinated pieces of chicken, meat or fish, or prawns, on bamboo skewers is how satay is made. When you see them cooking on a grill in Singapore at night time, the combination of the sultry tropical air, the orangey light from the charcoal-fuelled flames, the alluring scent of the bamboo and the appearance of the mouth-watering, sizzling satay all combine to make you want to eat them, now.

Just thinking of them again made we want to have some and, with no current plans to visit Singapore, I made my own. You’ll find the recipe below along with one for peanut sauce, for dipping.

Before threading on the marinated chicken, you need to soak the bamboo skewers in water to help prevent them from catching on fire when set on the grill. But even when you do that they still can ignite. That explains why in Singapore you see grills with a long narrow strip of metal about 10 to 15 centimetres wide on one side. When the satay is set on the grill, the meat portion is placed over the fire. The wood portion rests on the fire-insulted strip of metal, preventing the exposed part of the skewer from catching on fire.

As noted in a previous story on satay, to recreate this on my propane barbecue, I set a double thick strip of aluminum foil of similar width on the front portion of my grill. I then heat the grill to medium-high and set the meat portion of the skewer over the flame, and the meatless end on the foil. This technique, along with soaking the skewers in water, should prevent the exposed parts of wood from igniting.

Chicken Satay

Small cubes of chicken, spicily marinated Southeast Asian-style, are threaded on skewers and then grilled until charred, succulent and delicious. Serve the satay as an appetizer, or as a main-course, with rice and stir-fried vegetables.

Preparation time: 40 minutes, plus marinating time

Cooking time: about six minutes

Makes: Four servings (five satay each)

2 Tbsp vegetable oil, plus some for grill

2 Tbsp brown sugar

2 large garlic cloves, minced

1 tsp salt, or to taste

1 tsp finely grated fresh ginger

1 tsp ground coriander 1/2 tsp ground cumin

1/2 tsp ground turmeric

1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper

1 medium lime, finely grated zest and juice of

700 grams (about 10) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into small, about 3/4-inch, cubes 20 bamboo skewers (see Note)

cilantro sprigs or mint sprigs, sliced cucumber and onion, for serving (optional)

• peanut sauce (see recipe below)

Combine the 2 Tbsp vegetable oil, sugar, garlic, salt, ginger, coriander, cumin, turmeric, cayenne and lime zest and juice in bowl large enough to hold the chicken. Add the chicken and turn to coat. Cover chicken and marinate in the refrigerator four hours.

While chicken marinates, soak the skewers in cold water until needed. When chicken has marinated, thread four or five pieces of it on one end of each skewer (see Eric’s options).

Preheat your barbecue or indoor grill to medium high. Lightly oil the bars of the grill. Set on the satay and cook about six minutes, turning occasionally, or until cooked through. Arrange satay on a serving platter and garnish, if desired, with cilantro sprigs (or mint sprigs, cucumber and onion. Serve satay with the peanut sauce, for dipping.

Note: Bamboo skewers are sold at many supermarkets and stores selling kitchenware.

Eric’s options: You can skewer the chicken many hours before cooking the satay. Keep satay refrigerated until ready to grill. Any satay you won’t eat now could be frozen, uncooked. When needed, thaw and grill as directed. Small cubes of beef sirloin, pork leg or lamb leg could be used instead of chicken.

Peanut Sauce

Rich, savoury, peanutty sauce you can dunk the chicken satay in.

Preparation time: Five minutes

Cooking time: a few minutes

Makes: about one cup

1/3 cup peanut butter (see Note 1)

1 (5.6 oz/165 mL) can coconut milk (see Note 2)

1 medium lime, juiced and zested

3 Tbsp soy sauce

1 Tbsp brown sugar

1 Tbsp water

1 tsp finely grated fresh ginger

• pinch ground cayenne pepper

Place the ingredients in a small pot. Set over medium heat, bring to a simmer and whisk until smooth. Simmer two minutes. Serve sauce warm or at room temperature (see Eric’s options).

Note 1: I used local Island Nut Roastery peanut butter when testing this recipe. For more information about it, including stores that sell it, go to their website islandnutroastery.com. I’ve also made this sauce with smooth styles of peanut butter.

Note 2: You’ll find smaller sized cans of coconut milk for sale alongside the larger cans of it at some supermarkets. I you can’t find it, buy a larger can, use a scant 3/4 cup of it for the peanut sauce, and save the rest for another use or freeze it for another time.

Eric’s options: You can make the peanut sauce up to a day before needed. If you do, cool it to room temperature and then cover and refrigerate unto needed. When you do need it, warm it up, until fluid again. Thin sauce with a little more water, if you find it thick.

1 large garlic clove, minced

2/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

2 large eggs, beaten

• salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

16 medium fresh basil leaves

16 (3/4-inch square) mozzarella cheese (about 125 to 150 grams)

3/4 cup dried breadcrumbs

• vegetable oil, for frying

• warm tomato sauce, to taste (see recipe below and Eric’s options)

Place stock in a pot and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. When simmering, turn heat to it’s lowest setting.

Heat olive oil in a second pot set over medium, medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook and stir until tender, about five minutes. Add rice and garlic and cook and stir two minutes more.

Pour in 1 cup of the stock, lowering the heat as needed so that it very gently simmers.

Simmer until that stock is almost fully absorbed by the rice. Slowly add remaining stock in 1/3-cup increments, cooking and stirring until it’s almost fully absorbed by the rice before adding the next 1/3-cup. It should take about 20 minutes to use up all the stock and at that point the rice should look thick and creamy and just be tender (al dente), with a tiny bit of firmness when bitten into.

Remove rice from the heat and stir in Parmesan cheese. Spread rice out on a baking sheet and cool to room temperature. Thoroughly mix the beaten eggs into the rice and season with salt and pepper.

Line a second baking sheet with parchment paper. Put the breadcrumbs into a shallow bowl.

To make suppli, divide the rice into 16 portions, each about 1/3 cup. Dampen your hands with cold water, lift up a portion of the rice and set a basil leaf and piece of cheese in the centre of it. Shape rice into an egg-shaped ball, ensuring the cheese and basil is completely encased by the rice. Fill and form the remaining portions of rice into suppli as you did the first one. When you do, occasionally dampen your hands with water again to help prevent the rice from sticking.

Coat suppli in breadcrumbs and set on the parchment paper-lined baking sheet (see Eric’s options).

Pour three inches of vegetable oil into a deep pot (see Eric’s options). Set over medium-high heat and warm oil to 350 F, or until a small cube of bread fries gold brown in about 15 seconds when dropped into the oil.

Preheat oven to 200 F. Working in batches of three or four, fry the suppli about three and a half to four minutes, until rich golden brown and hot in the centre. Drain on paper towel and set the cooked suppli on a clean baking sheet and keep warm in the oven while you fry the rest. Serve the suppli with tomato sauce.

Note: Rice for risotto is sold at most supermarkets. Bags of it are sometimes simply labeled “risotto rice” or “Italian rice.” You’ll also find specific varieties of rice that are good for risotto, such as arborio, carnaroli or vialone nano.

Eric options: You can make the suppli many hours in advance. Cover and refrigerate until ready to fry. The suppli can also be frozen. If you do that, thaw them before frying.

The suppli could also be fried in a deep fryer. If you don’t want make your own tomato sauce, serve the suppli with a store-bought one, such as passata di pomodoro (strained tomatoes).

Summer Tomato Sauce with Basil

In-season, ripe, red tomatoes cooked and then blended into a sauce you can serve with suppli al telefono and other Italian-style dishes, such as pasta. It yields more sauce than you’ll need for the suppli, but the leftover sauce, once cooled, will freeze well.

Preparation time: 25 minutes

Cooking time: About 20 minutes

Makes: About 3 1/2 to 4 cups

2 1/2 lbs. ripe red tomatoes (see Note 1)

2 Tbsp olive oil

1/2 medium onion, diced

• pinch or 2 fennel seeds, coarsely crushed (optional; see Note 2)

• pinch red pepper flakes

16 medium fresh basil leaves, or to taste

• salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cut stem end out of each tomato; mark a shallow X at the top of the blossom end. Plunge tomatoes, a few at a time, into the boiling water for 60 seconds, or until the skins start to loosen. Use a slotted spoon to lift tomatoes out of the water, set on a wide plate and cool a few minutes, until safe enough to handle.

Pull the skins off the tomatoes. Cut each tomato in half. Set a fine sieve over a bowl. Squeeze or pull out the seeds from each tomato half into the sieve. Use a whisk to push out as much liquid as you can from the tomato seed mixture. Compost the seeds and skins.

Set the seeded tomato halves on a large cutting board and coarsely chop. Set the chopped tomatoes and the juices on the board in the bowl with the strained tomato seed liquid in it.

Heat oil in a medium pot set over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until tender, about five minutes.

Add the chopped tomatoes to the pot. Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the tomatoes are very tender and falling apart, about 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in the basil.

Purée the tomato sauce in the pot with an immersion (hand) blender. The puréeing could also be done in a food processor or blender. Taste and season the tomato sauce with salt and pepper and it’s ready.

Note 1: Ripe, deep red tomatoes good for making sauce include an heirloom variety called oxheart, beefsteak tomatoes, ultra sweet tomatoes and/or roma (plum) tomatoes.

Note 2: You can coarsely crush the fennel seeds in a spice grinder, or by placing them in a thick plastic bag and hitting them with a kitchen hammer.

The phrase quickly became a rallying cry to change course, taking advantage of the break in business as usual.

The serious challenges we currently face include the environmental crisis, pandemics, cyber warfare, terrorism and a renewed nuclear threat, among others. All are global. Our greatest strengths, on the other hand, are dedicated individuals working in common cause. To take a look at our options in aligning our strengths and challenges, we need to exit the news cycle to examine an interesting bit of inconvenient history.

article continues below

When the UN Charter was created 75 years ago it was reluctantly permitted a concession deemed necessary for the Charter’s acceptance by Stalin’s Russia and the United States Congress, both flush with victory from the Second World War. They, along with France, the UK and China, were given veto power over UN Security Council decisions, effectively giving five nations disproportionate power.

The framers of the 1945 Charter also incorporated plans for a Charter review conference, to be held within 10 years. Unfortunately, the Cold War and inertia set in, and that conference never happened. Many decades later, the United Nations presides with great difficulty over a world still desperately in need of global governance that is just, effective and inclusive.

The need for unity in the international sphere is greater than ever. A belief in that unity has inspired me along with generations of other Bahá’ís. “The well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established,” said Bahá’u’lláh, the founder of the Bahá’í faith. “It is not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country, but rather for him who loveth the whole world. The earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens.”

That idealistic spirit is alive and well. A young generation of problem-solvers from every background has arisen around the world, often motivated by environmental concerns. Together First, Common Home for Humanity, Ocean Unite, Simpol and Democracy Without Borders are incredibly promising international initiatives. If we’re to move forward together, we need to give such organizations our full attention.

The visceral, entertaining forms of politics make the news, but it’s the quiet, hard-working efforts that tend to change the course of history. Unfortunately, disillusioned with corruption and polarization, many believe that things were just fine before we had global problems and global institutions, if only we could turn back the hands of time – although they weren’t and we can’t.

The drama plays out against a backdrop of cynicism and despair, which in itself hampers progress. Still, enormous changes can begin almost imperceptibly. Beginning in 1993, Canada was followed by the European Parliament, the PanAfrican Parliament and the World Federation of United Nations Associations, all calling for the establishment of a UN Parliamentary Assembly (UNPA) to help correct the “democratic deficit” in global decision-making. The UNPA Campaign may provide a solution to decades of broken environmental promises, since democracy is essential to a legitimate capacity to enact laws.

There are several proposed routes towards bringing greater justice and the rule of law to the international sphere. (See the Times Colonist 5 August article in the online Spiritually Speaking blog for links.) The United Nations needs to follow its advice and “Build Back Better”, with support and assistance from civil society. It’s up to us, as world citizens, to pay attention and do what we can.

The whole world is involved and grappling with it is a new deal for most of us. A spiritually oriented person for most of my adult life, I thought initially that I would find this change an opportunity to dig deeper. Well, that quickly became sheer necessity! I had no idea how wired I was into the physical patterns of attachment to dear ones. Being brought up in a large family, with hugging, arm-in-arm walking, and affection being the norm, I’m learning to ‘hug’ from a distance, to fill the six feet between me and others with warm love.

So how to go deeper, to find that wellspring of comfort and love that we in ECKANKAR call the ECK or Spirit?

article continues below

We have some tools. Sacred words, the most universal being an ancient name of God, ‘HU’ (rhymes with you), can express the vibration and the sound of Divine Love. Sung on a single note on the outgoing breath, HU can be used aloud or silently, as a single utterance or as a song or chant for as long as needed or desired. Lately I have needed to sing it a little longer to calm myself and gain entry into the Light and Sound of God. But once I arrive there, I am filled with gratitude, relaxation and a desire to go further. Of course, I cannot spend my whole day sitting quietly chanting HU. However, I can pause in the supermarket when someone scowls at me or I accidentally turn into the wrong aisle, and inwardly sing a few HUs to regain my balance. Or when I get back in the car after a hyper alert visit to the hospital to drop my husband off for surgery, I can take a moment and sing HU to bring myself into harmony with life. I find it helps with the acceptance of what is going on.

So, our inner being is getting a real workout. We are, perhaps, finding areas that we thought we had put aside forever or no longer needed to resolve. Deep questions may arise. Answers are found when we can access profound love and gratitude for this experience called life. In ECKANKAR, we have a living master, a guide and support who not only teaches us through talks and books, but is also available for personal guidance in contemplation and dreams. His inner being, the Mahanta consciousness, embodies Divine Love to such a degree that he uplifts those with whom he comes into contact, physically, or in the inner realms. To reach him in your contemplations, it is helpful to focus on love, a beautiful idea or quote, or to visualise his face or that of someone you love. Sometimes this consciousness can be seen within as a blue light or ball of light. You may hear a voice or the sounds of the inner planes. If you receive direction from a voice in this state, it will only direct you to kind, loving thoughts and actions. Anything negative or hurtful is not a manifestation of the Mahanta, the Living ECK Master.

If we are to grow and benefit from this worldly experience of isolation, deprivation, and worldwide awareness, we need to dig deeper, to find the key that dwells in our hearts, and practice living in the Love that comes from the essence of life. Some call it God, Allah, Brahma. In ECK, we call It Sugmad, the Ocean of Love and Mercy. It can be found by using the HU sound to go within.

Early this week, there was a flutter of consternation within the arts community over COVID-19, the virus that’s now reached pandemic proportions. By Thursday night, announcements of show cancellations — some of them last-minute — had swelled from a trickle to a fast-flowing river.

I first heard of this Thursday. That night, I was set to attend a performance of Lillian Hellman’s The Children’s Hour staged by University of Victoria’s Phoenix Theatre. Then Adrienne Holierhoek, the theatre’s publicist, emailed me with sobering news: the performance was cancelled.

“We’re not going ahead with a public performance, as we’re on the verge of the 250 limit,” she said. Holierhoek would now spend a busy night doing damage control.

She added wryly: “Let’s just say I’m having granola bars for dinner.”

As is the case with many performing arts companies in Victoria and throughout the province, the cancellation was in deference to a recommendation by B.C. health officer Bonnie Henry. On Thursday she suggested cancelling events expected to draw crowds of 250 or more to help contain the highly contagious virus.

That night, the list of cancellations continued to grow. Pacific Opera Victoria’s production of Flight of the Hummingbird, set to run Friday to March 22, is postponed indefinitely. The Victoria Symphony has discontinued its concerts. Dance Victoria says this weekend’s performances of Romeo + Juliet by Ballet B.C. are cancelled.

The Royal and McPherson theatres are closed until further notice.

Yesterday morning, I sat down to write a review of Busted Up: A Yukon Story, which played the Belfry Theatre’s Spark Festival. It’s a first-rate show and was to conclude its run tonight.

Later that morning, the Belfry’s communications director, Mark Dusseault, told me his company had made the difficult decision to cancel further Spark Festival performances. This festival, a showcase of new theatre, was originally to continue to March 22.

“It’s heartbreaking,” said Dusseault.

A decision had to be made quickly. One company was preparing to fly to Victoria from its home province of Newfoundland for Spark shows. The Belfry didn’t want them to invest effort, time and expense, only to learn their run was canceled.

Langham Court Theatre has cancelled today’s final performances of I and You.

Manager Michelle Buck said Langham Court originally considered capping the audience at 75 (the theatre’s capacity is 175) to allow for “social distancing” — that is, leaving physical spaces between attendees.

But in the end, the company — regretfully — decided to play it safe.

“It’s such a good little show,” Buck said. “It’s sad to pull it from underneath them.”

Dusseault, who has worked in theatre for 30 years, cannot remember a situation like this ever occurring before in Victoria. Yes, there have been other calamities: 9/11, the Gulf War, the global SARS outbreak of 2003. But nothing ever shut down the arts scene like COVID-19 has.

Not every theatre company has closed its doors. Blue Bridge Repertory Theatre says no upcoming events at its Roxy Theatre have been cancelled. The Roxy will host a musical tribute to the Beatles March 26 to 29.

It is, of course, disappointing for audiences when performances are cancelled. You not only miss out on the show, there’s the task of getting a refund. Yet for arts organizations, the fallout from this situation is much more profound.

Many companies scrape by to survive. Over the past 30 years, government funding has eroded. Audiences for opera, classical music and theatre are getting older. And in general, the battle for audiences is becoming much more intense.

For example, years ago, direct-to-consumer services such as Netflix didn’t even exist.

A new meme now making the social-media rounds suggests people holding tickets to cancelled shows should consider opting out of a refund. By doing so, you make a donation to the company in question.

It’s a noble notion worth considering. One potential legacy of COVID-19 is that it will shut down some arts organizations permanently. And once they go under, it’s difficult — if not impossible — to resurrect them.

Ours is a culturally rich city. During this difficult time, let us be aware of that, of the fragility and importance of the arts in Victoria."

For instance, there was John Green’s The Fault in Our Stars (2012), a young adult novel (subsequently a film) about a girl with cancer who falls for a boy suffering from the same.

And there’s the 2019 movie Five Feet Apart, about a young woman with cystic fibrosis who becomes romantically involved with an ailing young man.

article continues below

Langham Court Theatre has just opened Lauren Gunderson’s 2014 play I and You. In this two-actor drama, Caroline, a high-school student with a serious liver ailment, receives a surprise visit from a classmate. Like a cactus flower in an inhospitable desert, young love ultimately blooms.

Caroline — feisty and smart — has never before met Anthony, a decent young man with a heart as big as Kansas. At the beginning, in true rom-com style, the pair spar and bicker furiously before bonding like Super Glue.

I and You was a hit, gleaning critical acclaim and enjoying well over 20 productions since it debuted. Gunderson has, meanwhile, emerged as one of America’s most produced playwrights.

Some will find I and You a touch jejune and sentimental in the manner of after-school TV specials.

A melodramatic surprise ending will leave you either thrilled or groaning. There’s a distinctly YA-lit vibe throughout this 90-minute play (I kept thinking of the classic line, “Stay gold, Ponyboy,” from S.E. Hinton’s The Outsiders).

An audience noticeably younger than Langham Court’s usual crowd responded enthusiastically to Thursday’s opening performance. Certainly this production of I and You, capably directed by John Han, has its share of strengths.

The show benefits from the talents of two promising actors. Jesse Deutscher (Caroline) and Justin Francis Lee (Anthony) offered well-rehearsed, energetic performances.

The detailed set is terrific — Caroline’s bedroom is stuffed with groovy teen detritus: vintage Elvis poster, lava lamp, cat-scratching post, retro-lamps and so on. Wide-screen clips of computer games and music videos work well; all light, video and sound cues were handled adroitly.

The play commences with Anthony, wearing a backward baseball cap, dropping in unannounced. He spouts a cryptic line that turns out to be a quote from Walt Whitman’s famous poem Song of Myself.

Caroline — a tiny girl in a too-big sweatshirt — is bewildered and frightened. Anthony hastily explains he’s volunteered to be her partner for a school assignment. Nonetheless Caroline, who is homebound because of her liver ailment, lashes out at the intruder for 20 or 30 minutes.

This introductory section is heavily salted with sitcom teen speak. “What is wrong with you, super hater?” says Anthony. “Walt Whitman can bite me,” says Caroline.

Eventually she does agree to a partnership — they’ll create a Whitman-inspired poster together. “How do you feel about glitter?” Caroline asks. “Philosophically I’m agnostic on glitter,” says Anthony.

It’s doubtful anyone outside a Neil Simon (or Lauren Gunderson) play actually speaks like this. Happily, about halfway through, the quip-fest subsides and we get to know the characters a little more.

Bon mots on the benefits of Chunky Monkey ice cream and Caroline’s toy turtle give way to heavier subjects. Anthony turns out to be a John Coltrane devotee; she digs Jerry Lee Lewis.

Caroline is a gifted photographer with a Whitman-esque love for minutia; he has just witnessed a terrible tragedy on the basketball court.

Deutscher, as Caroline, sometimes displayed flashes of nuance and a knack for subtle facial expression. And the more the playwright eased up on the shallow-end-of-the-pool banter, the more Lee was able to dig into the character of Anthony.

Gunderson intends to say something brave and refreshing about the fleeting, transcendent beauty of life — never a bad thing. And if I and You sends you back to that tattered copy of Walt Whitman poems on your bookshelf, so much the better.

The show continues at Langham Court to March 14."

It isn’t Hyundai’s least expensive vehicle yet, but it soon may be. In some markets, Hyundai has already discontinued the Accent, its current five-door subcompact hatchback, giving the Venue the crown. But that hasn’t happened in North America — yet.

The Venue comes in four trim levels, with my tester, the Ultimate model, carrying a sticker price of $24,899.

The Venue is aimed at the urban first-time buyer, and it appeals to that group with a budget-friendly price. Despite its diminutive dimensions, its boxy body contains ample room for friends and cargo.

Headroom is a generous 1,000 millimetres in the front and 980 mm in the back. Legroom is 1,050 front and 870 mm back, with passenger interior volume pegged at 2,602 litres.

My tester had the Ultimate trim level — the fanciest — with premium items more commonly found in luxury brands. The interior is simple, uncluttered and logically arranged.

Comfort items that I didn’t expect include a heated steering wheel, power sunroof, push-button start and climate control.

The rear seatbacks fold 60/40 and the cargo floor has two positions. Cargo capacity is 335 litres with the seats up and 1,148 with them down.

The infotainment system consists of an eight-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability. The menus were easy to decipher and the system response time was good.

Technophiles will appreciate Hyundai’s BlueLink connected vehicle system, which allows users to access some functions — such as remote vehicle lock or unlock, remote start and remote climate control via their smartphone.

The system even has an automatic collision notification function that will call for emergency services in case of a crash.

My tester had navigation built-in, but lesser trims don’t offer that feature.

There is only one engine available, a 1.6-litre four cylinder producing 121 horsepower and 113 pound-feet of torque.

A manual transmission is available — but only in the base model. Every other trim gets a continuously variable transmission).

Power is delivered to the front wheels only — there is no all-wheel-drive option. As if to compensate, drivers can choose a Snow option along with Normal and Sport modes.

Let’s be frank, that last mode is more optimistic than fact. If you do choose Sport, the engine rpms go up, but you don’t really go faster.

If performance is what you’re after, you really should consider the Kona, the Venue’s bigger brother.

Fuel economy is 8.0 litres per 100 km in the city and 7.0 on the highway.

Compared with the Nissan Kicks, another subcompact SUV, power output and fuel consumption are similar.

With a 2,520-mm wheelbase and a 5.1-metre turning radius, the Venue is refreshingly nimble in the city. Unfortunately, the short wheelbase also results in a choppy ride on rough roads.

Apart from premium touches in the cabin, the Ultimate also impresses with its safety suite.

You get forward collision-avoidance assist (with automated emergency braking), lane-departure warning with lane-keeping assist, driver-attention warning, blind-spot collision warning with lane-change assist and rear cross-traffic warning.

While these features have become more common of late thanks to trickle-down effect of technology, it is the first time an entry-level model (albeit the highest trim in the line) has been so equipped.

With certain models, the Venue contrasts its entry-level stigma with a trendy/hip vibe, with eye-catching two-tone paint schemes and flashy wheels.

The Venue might be inexpensive to start. It can even be plain. But dress it up and you can go to town — and that’s the point.

SUVs and crossovers are everywhere these days. And every day you hear of a manufacturer introducing larger and larger models that can carry more cargo and passengers.

Lexus has quietly gone the other way, with a model that hits all the high notes in a subcompact body.

It is a segment that has seen a number of luxury entrants, from the Volvo XC40 to the BMW X1.

But Lexus has a winning card up its sleeve.

Luxury brands traditionally play up on their vehicle’s performance versus regular brands. Lexus, on the other hand, can tout their fuel efficiency as a trump card instead.

The UX is available as the 200, with a 2.0-litre four-cylinder that produces 168 horsepower, or the 250h, with an Atkinson-cycle 2.0-litre gasoline engine mated with Lexus’ fourth-generation electric hybrid system that cranks out a combined 181 hp.

I drove the latter car with the F Sport Series 2 package.

If you like luxury, yet want to drive something socially conscious at the same time, the UX hybrid is your vehicle.

With a gentle foot, you could be able to consume a miserly 5.7 litres of fuel per 100 kilometres in the city and 6.2 on the highway.

The hybrid drivetrain technology, from parent Toyota, works seamlessly and effectively. While the competition fits engine stop/start to its vehicles, the electric motor in the hybrid drive in the UX provides propulsion until about 10 km/h.

The UX will, under light load, revert to electric power even at higher speeds. The transition is completely transparent — the only way you can tell is when the vehicle tells you of the change.

A drive-mode selector allows you to choose Eco or Sport if you find the middle-of-the-road Normal setting not aggressive enough for your driving style.

Choose Sport when you desire an extra urgency to your drive, but don’t expect too much. The UX will get from zero to 100 km/h in about nine seconds.

The regular UX is front-wheel-drive only. The hybrid UX sends engine power to the front wheels via a CVT transmission and uses an electric motor to power the rear wheels, making it all-wheel drive.

If you choose to take to the back roads, you will find the UX 250h a pleasant companion.

My tester had the F Sport package, which includes a sport-tuned suspension and 18-inch wheels, among other performance upgrades.

The interior is a knockout, with an edgy design and a youthful vibe. My tester had an attractive contrasting red-on-black colour scheme.

The traditional analog gauges have been replaced by an eight-inch customizable digital display in front of the driver.

The 10.3-inch infotainment screen is on the top of the dash. It is flanked by an conventional analog clock — a nice, classy touch.

The system is hamstrung by a too-sensitive touchpad controller that I found frustrating to use.

As if to compensate, Lexus has relocated the audio system’s volume and tuning knob to the outside edges of the centre console. It’s an unconventional location, but it works great once you are used to it.

Although the UX may be the least-expensive Lexus, you wouldn’t know when sitting in it. Fit and finish is excellent, with attention to detail evident throughout. My tester was the top of the line and came with items such as heated and ventilated front seats, power adjustable seat belts, a premium audio system and supportive seats.

The only thing that Lexus could not change is the tight rear quarters. If you are on the tall side, you might want to think twice about having anybody sit behind you.

The cargo capacity on par with this segment, with 486 litres of capacity.

However, the liftover height makes it difficult to load heavy cargo. That’s disappointing because there doesn’t seem to be anything — not even a spare tire — underneath the floor.

The UX comes with a comprehensive driver-assistance suite. Standard features include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, bicycle and pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning, lane-tracking assist and traffic-sign recognition.

The parking-assist system uses sensors to detect objects when you are backing up, and will apply the brakes automatically if it senses an imminent collision.

As the entry-level vehicle to the Lexus brand, the UX is well-suited to its role. It is affordable (for a luxury vehicle), looks attractive on the outside and the well-appointed cabin is a great place to dwell.

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

article continues below

""After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,"" Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal's three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first overall by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

""A low-maintenance superstar,"" said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg's senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At five foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn't blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack of getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday. ""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League. I think it was Dale's arrival that really cemented the future of the franchise and I think we all have recollections of that first year, that Calder (Trophy) year and then everything that would follow.

""He was truly a superstar as a hockey player, but I think why he was so loved here was not just that but largely the fact that he made this his home and became one of us. I think everybody shared that sense of pride in Dale's career as a player.""

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: ""All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL's all time greatest players.""

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

""What an incredible human being,"" Selanne tweeted.

Montreal Canadiens associate coach Kirk Muller also had a chance to speak with Hawerchuk in recent days.

""I talked to Dale a few days ago, and we had a good chance to chat. A good friend, had a real good opportunity to play against one of the all-time best players. As a hockey player, we all know how great he was, but he was a good friend and just a really special person, did a lot for charities. It's a real loss for us in the hockey world.""

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk ""one of the most decorated players in our game's history.""

In September 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

""For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I'm ready to fight it,"" he told TSN in October 2019. ""I want to live to tell the story.""

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie's bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames players Andrew Mangiapane and Rasmus Andersson remembered playing for Hawerchuk in Barrie.

""I don't know where I'd be without him,"" said Mangiapane. ""Very sad news today. I owe my career basically to him and the whole Barrie organization.""

Andersson, from Sweden, said ""Dale was a fantastic human being. Such a great person. My first week in Barrie he invited us over to his house and really just welcomed me to Canada. I cannot say enough good things about him as a person. Obviously a real good coach, too.""

""It's awful news.""

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday's opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at age two and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur's record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

""I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive — well maybe a little further now with the traffic,"" he said. ""I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""

""I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,"" he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and '81 with teammates that included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL's top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt like he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year — the youngest recipient at the time — and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

""Just one of the greatest. You could tell from day one. We knew from when he was 18 years old as a player that he would turn the (Jets) franchise around. Certainly one of the best I’ve ever played with and coached,"" said Dallas Stars coach Rick Bowness, who played with and coached Hawerchuk in the '80s.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

""He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,"" said Mike Doran, Winnipeg's director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the faceoff in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux's famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

""It turned out fantastic,"" said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada's call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets ""are etched in my mind every day that I live.""

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes' ring of honour.

Hawerchuk re-wrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia whom he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

""It's like going back down memory lane,"" he said in his induction speech.

""All the experiences have been fantastic,"" he added. ""I mean, sometimes they didn't feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing ... Even though I didn't win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn't change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.""

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets' Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November 2017.

""Tonight we fly Ducky's number high,"" said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue's ""Home Sweet Home,"" before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

""Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,"" said the PA announcer.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

""I've been to every part of (Manitoba), either golfing or playing (softball),"" Hawerchuk said. ""I've gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I'm honoured and I'm very humbled.""

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.

The CFL cancelled the 2020 campaign Monday after its quest for a $30-million, interest-free loan from Ottawa fell through. The league said it needed financial assistance from the federal government to stage an abbreviated season.

Bighill and Mitchell, in separate media availabilities Tuesday, offered very similar opinions on what the cancellation could mean for the league. Bighill, a middle linebacker, helped the Winnipeg Blue Bombers capture the Grey Cup last year after quarterback Mitchell guided the Calgary Stampeders to the '18 CFL title.

""This is a good opportunity for us to strengthen,"" Bighill said during a conference call that also involved Bombers quarterback Zach Collaros. ""We need to build a better relationship (between) the CFLPA and CFL as far as how well we're communicating and build a real relationship that we can move forward on.

""Randy (CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie) has said multiple times the business model has been broken so how do we fix it? Those are things that need to be addressed and we've got time to do that.""

Mitchell agreed.

""I just want to see the CFL and CFLPA work together in a more unified sense,"" Mitchell said. ""I think right now we can just come together and really find a way to make the CFL better, not just for 2021 . . . but the next 50 years, for guys who are going to come after us.

""I think this is a good chance to do it, so whatever that looks like I'm all for it.""

The CFL and CFLPA have had a sometimes acrimonious relationship, especially during collective bargaining talks. But the two sides were said to be close to having an amended CBA that would've allowed for a season to be played with federal funding.

But even that wasn't an entirely smooth process. In June, CFLPA executive director Brian Ramsey took to Twitter to express his frustration that the union hadn't heard from the league regarding its 2020 plans.

""We really didn't an offer to sit at the table and talk until June and then we really didn't get to look at a collective bargaining agreement until July,"" Bighill said. ""There could've been a lot of things, I think, that could've been done earlier.

""We need to work better together as a league and player reps and players union to make this product better.""

Collaros and Bighill played big roles in the Bombers downing the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 33-12 for their first Grey Cup title since 1990. Collaros was looking forward to defending that championship this year.

""I don't know if you win the championship in 2019 and 2021 if that counts as back-to-back,"" Collaros said. ""Man, it's really disappointing not to be able to get on the field and defend that title this year.""

A shortened CFL season would've been held in Winnipeg, the league's tentative hub city. In April, Collaros and his wife, Nicole, became first-time parents and although playing football would've meant being away from his family in a CFL bubble, Collaros was committed to suiting up for a 2020 campaign.

""It definitely would've been a conversation to have with my wife but I think we were both aligned on the same page that I was going to play,"" he said. ""We need to make money, that's the bottom line.

""I guess it's a good thing we don't have to have the conversation but at the same time you put a lot of work in to get ready for the season, physically and mentally. To have that kind of taken away and be strung along for months was not fun.""

Many CFL players will have to find alternate sources of income. Mitchell considers himself lucky as he received a signing bonus from Calgary as part of a restructured contract in December.

Mitchell, twice the CFL's most outstanding player, will use the extra time to further recover from off-season shoulder surgery.

""A year is lost but coming off shoulder surgery I really feel like . . . it's going to allow me to get my shoulder to 100 per cent and body feeling great,"" he said. ""I feel disappointed but blessed at the same time I'll be able to get my body and shoulder completely ready to go.""

Bighill, 31, who also won a Grey Cup with B.C. in 2011, will also be busy, working as a financial adviser.

""The idea was to be building a business that eventually I'd transition to (upon retirement),"" said Bighill, twice the CFL's top defensive player. ""It's good for me to be in a position that I am to at least have something I'm building and working on.""

Collaros, 31, who lives just outside Toronto in Aurora, Ont., with his wife and young daughter, has some details to iron out before deciding what's next.

""The trouble with me right now living in Canada is my permanent residency hasn't gone through yet,"" he said. ""So right now I'm only under contract to work for the CFL.

""We're trying to get that all squared away and figure out what to do moving forward.""

Collaros is hopeful fans stick with the CFL.

""I've really grown to love this game, the Canadian game, this league and the fans,"" he said. ""We just ask for the fans to stick behind us and know that we're putting all the work in to come back better and stronger in 2021.""

Shaw was at second base in the 10th when Cole Sulser (1-2) walked Vladimir Guerrero Jr., and both runners advanced on a bunt. Lourdes Gurriel Jr. followed with a sharp grounder to first that Chris Davis stabbed with a dive, then threw home from a sitting position.

The ball took one hop and went through the hands of catcher Pedro Severino an instant before Shaw crossed the plate.

""For me, that was just a great play getting to the ball. He was trying to make a game-saving play,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""It kind of skipped up on Seve when he threw it from his rear end there. I give credit to CD for getting to the ball.""

Anthony Bass (1-0) entered in the ninth and got the final out of the game.

In the last of the 10th, Dwight Smith Jr. got caught in a rundown after sprinting too far past third base on a one-out single by Cedric Mullins.

""Disappointed that we didn’t score in the bottom half,"" Hyde said. ""Had an opportunity and made a mistake. Tough loss.""

The Blue Jays had no complaints after improving to 2-3 in extra innings.

""We played well enough to win this game,"" manager Charlie Montoyo noted,

Randal Grichuk extended his torrid hitting surge for Toronto, homering and driving in four runs. He connected with a man on against Wade LeBlanc in the third inning and greeted reliever Travis Lakins with a bases-loaded double to ignite a five-run fifth that made it 7-3.

Grichuk is on a seven-game hitting streak — including four straight multi-hit games — to raise his batting average 75 points to .333. In addition, over the last five games he has four homers and 11 RBIs.

Shaw also homered for the Blue Jays, who can complete a three-game sweep Wednesday.

Anthony Santander hit a pair of two-run homers for the Orioles, giving him nine for the season along with 26 RBIs. But Baltimore dropped its third straight and has lost four of five since a six-game winning streak.

Grichuk's offensive show put Toronto starter Nate Pearson in position to earn his first big league win. But the highly touted prospect was yanked in the fifth after allowing his third homer, a two-run shot by Chance Sisco that got Baltimore to 7-5.

Pearson now has a 6.61 ERA after four starts.

""He's got the stuff to pitch in the big leagues, but he's pitching from behind,"" Montoyo said. ""He hasn't been able to locate all his pitches.""

TOP GUNS

Toronto pulled off a rare feat Monday night when Grichuk had four RBIs and leadoff man Cavan Biggio added three. According to Elias, it was only the seventh time since 1920 (when the RBI became a stat) that all seven of a team's runs were driven in by the top two batters in the lineup.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: SS Bo Bichette received a second opinion on his ailing right knee, which was confirmed to be a sprain, Montoyo said. There is no timetable for his return. ... 1B Rowdy Tellez was given the day off after getting hit in the head during a collision at first base Monday.

Orioles: SS José Iglesias (left quadriceps strain) was placed on the 10-day injured list. He has been playing through the injury for weeks, and Hyde decided it was time to take action. ""We just felt like giving him some extra days would be beneficial to him and us the rest of the season,"" Hyde said. Iglesias is batting .400 but has been serving mostly as the designated hitter, starting only two games at SS in August. ... Reliever Hunter Harvey (right forearm strain) should be back by the end of the month, Hyde said.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: Tanner Roark (1-1, 6.00 ERA) makes his fourth start of year Wednesday afternoon in the series finale. He's 0-3 with a 6.88 ERA lifetime against the Orioles, but hasn't faced them since 2016.

Orioles: Tommy Milone (1-2, 4.00) last pitched against the Jays in 2014 for Oakland.

Alex Ovechkin scored twice, including the go-ahead goal early in the third period, as Washington rallied from two goals down to beat the New York Islanders 3-2 Tuesday night and avoid a sweep in their first-round series.

""I started to see it in the second half of the first period,"" Rierden said. :""We started to impose our will a little bit and tilt the ice in our favour by getting some offensive zone shifts. That’s mandatory for us to have success as a team.""

Evgeny Kuznetsov also scored for the Capitals and Braden Holtby stopped 24 shots. Washington won for the second time in seven post-season games, going 1-1-1 in round-robin play in the qualifying round to fall to the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference, and then losing the first three games against the Islanders.

""Any comeback is exciting but I think it’s more the way we played in the second and third periods,"" Holtby said. ""I think that’s the key to our ability to come back and win the series. If we play every period like that its going to be really, really hard to beat us. ... Our job now is to make sure that filters over in the next game.""

Mathew Barzal and Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored in the first period to give New York a 2-0 lead. Semyon Varlamov finished with 26 saves.

""We got away from our game a little bit and they put on a press,"" Islanders captain Anders Lee said. ""Our start was obviously really nice tonight and we just didn't sustain that the way we needed to keep that momentum we earned in that first part of the period.""

The Islanders, who won three of four against Florida in the qualifying round, lost for the second time in eight games this post-season.

Game 5 is Thursday.

Ovechkin's second of the night 3:40 into the third period gave the Capitals their first lead. On a 2-on-1 with Tom Wilson, Ovechkin kept the puck and fired it past Varlamov for his fourth of the series. It was also the first goal Washington scored after the second period in this series.

New York pulled Varlamov for an extra skater with a little more than 1 1/2 minutes remaining, but couldn't tie it.

Washington controlled the play in the second period, keeping the puck in the offensive zone for much of the time. The Capitals outshot the Islanders 15-7 in the period and scored twice to tie it.

Kuznetsov got the Capitals on the scoreboard during 4-on-4 play as he brought the puck up the right side, cut across the front of the net and put it past Varlamov at 3:35.

""Big goal obviously by Kuzy gave us momentum,"" Ovechkin said. ""Holts was unbelievable today, PK blocking shots, do their job. We got rewarded. If we play like that we got pretty good chance to come back. But we’re going to take a game at a time.""

With Washington on the power play, Ovechkin fired a slap shot from the top of the left circle off a pass from John Carlson to tie it at 2-2 1:54 later.

The Isles were swarming in the offensive zone from the start of the game and had an 8-1 advantage on shots on goal over the first nearly 10 minutes, scoring twice.

Pageau put the Islanders ahead 1-0 as he deflected Scott Mayfield's point shot past Holtby at 3:50.

Barzal, who had the overtime winner in Game 3 on Sunday, made it 2-0 less than 5 1/2 minutes later. He brought the puck up the middle, passed to Nick Leddy to his left, and as he was streaking to the net, tipped the return pass from Leddy past Holtby.

Reirden called a timeout immediately after the goal, and Washington picked up its intensity after.

NOTES: Washington was again without F Nicklas Backstrom, who has not played since he was injured early in Game 1 after a hit by the Islanders' Lee. ... The Capitals went 1 for 5 on the power play and shut down the Islanders on their five chances. ... Pageau has four goals this post-season. He had three in the first round against Florida, and got his first of this series Tuesday. ... New York's Cal Clutterbuck left the game in the second period after a hit by Washington's Radko Gudas and did not return.

Dallas has a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven opening-round series. Game 6 goes Thursday.

John Klingberg and Jamie Benn scored for Dallas while Anton Khudobin stopped 28 shots in net for his second win of the series.

It was a game that fit the profile for Dallas in the regular season: tight defence and opportunistic offence for a squad that allowed just 2.52 goals against a game (2nd in NHL) but scored just 2.58 a game (26th).

The winner came early in the third period. Klingberg fired a wrist shot from the blue line through traffic that beat goaltender Cam Talbot high on the short side.

It was his first goal of the post-season, to go with six assists. Klingberg credited winger Mattias Janmark, who bounced back from taking a wicked Noah Hanifin slapshot on the ankle in the first period to set up the winner.

""Janmark did a great job picking up the puck on the boards on his backhand, holding on to it and finding me on the weak side,"" said Klingberg.

""That's something we've been talking a lot about as a team, trying to get more O-zone (time).

""He took control of the puck, had a guy on his back, and still made a play so I could just walk down and wrist that shot through, and luckily it went in.""

Benn scored the first goal of the game the hard way, barrelling down the ice on a 2-on-1 with Tyler Seguin.

Seguin backhanded a pass to Benn that he redirected at top speed in the blue paint as he freight-trained into the crossbar, knocking the net off its pegs.

It was ruled a short-handed goal but the teams were just coming off 4-on-4 play at the time. Seguin said he thought about shooting but then saw Benn.

""It was an instinctive play,"" said Seguin.

""Jamie was going hard to the back post. I think the crossbar got the best of him there. It was a big hit but good goal.""

It was Benn's second goal of the series, to go with two assists.

Mikael Backlund, with his fourth goal of the post-season, replied for Calgary. Talbot stopped 30 shots in his ninth consecutive post-season start.

Flames winger Andrew Mangiapane said they need to narrow their field of vision for Game 6.

""I still think we've got more than what we're kind of showing here,"" he said.

""I think we've just got to go out and play our game and I think we'll be OK.""

Defenceman Rasmus Andersson said it will be a trench battle: ""I still think we can put more pucks to the net and just try to work them more down low.""

Prior to Tuesday, it had been Calgary winning the low-scoring games (3-2 and 2-0) while Dallas had triumphed in a pair of 5-4 shootouts.

It was a game the Stars dominated through the first two periods, with Talbot keeping the Flames in it by turning aside numerous high-percentage chances off the rush and from the slot.

Calgary was outshot 14-7 in the first period, but showed signs of life as the game wore on when Tobias Rieder joined Johnny Gaudreau and Sean Monahan on the top line, with Elias Lindholm bumped down to play alongside Mangiapane and Backlund on the second trio.

Rieder has three goals in the post-season — all shorthanded — and has been elevated to the top six in place of Matthew Tkachuk.

Tkachuk, the notorious agitator and Flames top scorer in the regular season, hasn't played since he was knocked woozy on a hit late in Game 2.

Ben Bishop, the Stars' regular season No. 1 goalie, did not dress for a second consecutive game. The NHL is not releasing injury information.

It was an emotional day for interim Dallas coach Rick Bowness. He could be seen blinking back tears as he watched a pre-game video tribute to former teammate and friend Dale Hawerchuk, who died Tuesday after a battle with stomach cancer at 57.

Bowness both played with and coached Hawerchuk in the 1980s with the Winnipeg Jets.

""One thing I remember with Dale, when he bought his first house, I think he emptied the pool and painted a Winnipeg Jet logo on the bottom of the pool right away.

""He was very proud to be a Winnipeg Jet.""

All Western Conference games are being played at Rogers Place, with players isolating in a so-called bubble in between to prevent contracting COVID-19.

It was nothing new to Anthony (Doc) Cornell.

article continues below

VanVleet played for Cornell's AAU team Pryme Time in his hometown of Rockford, Ill., and the coach said even as a seventh grader the Toronto Raptors guard had nerves of steel.

There was the tournament, Cornell recalled, where VanVleet reached in for a steal and took a headbutt to the eye.

""His eye literally is swollen shut, he looks like Rocky,"" Cornell said. ""So the physician at the tournament was like 'Doc, this boy can't play, he's gotta go get stitches.'

""Fred looked at me and said 'I'm playing.' The doctor was like 'Fred, you can't see.' Not only does Fred play, he leads us in scoring and assists with one eye in the championship game. People were like, 'Man, Fred has one eye, and he's killing y'all,'"" Cornell said with a loud laugh.

""Those type of moments were always like 'man, he's just on a different level.'""

The undrafted star out of Wichita State was cut under the eye and chipped a front tooth in Game 4 of the Finals against Golden State. His battered face lent another layer to the already rich story when he poured in 22 points, including a huge three-pointer, late in the Raptors' title-clinching Game 6 win over the Warriors.

The 26-year-old has picked up where he left off last post-season, erupting for 30 points in Monday's Game 1 win over Brooklyn in the opening round of the playoffs in Florida. VanVleet knocked down eight three-pointers and assisted on another seven.

On one late three-pointer, VanVleet pulled up to leave his defender, skidding by him like a puppy on linoleum.

VanVleet said he's been working on shooting from longer distance, sparked by conversations with coach Nick Nurse during last year's playoffs. The six-foot guard was getting blocked too often, and the Raptors needed him scoring.

""So I started putting it in my game and I've just been working on it more and more since then,"" VanVleet said Tuesday. ""Obviously with the playoffs, it's a little bit harder to get your shot off, and guys are flying around a little bit more. If you can knock it down from distance, it just makes it that much harder for the defence to run out to you. Sometimes you catch 'em off guard or you just avoid that extra couple inches of hand to contest.""

Mr. Bet on Yourself has always loved a good challenge.

Cornell's Pryme Time roster, which VanVleet helped transform into the most successful in Rockford AAU history, was unconventional. Where other AAU teams would load up with four or five bigs, Cornell preferred guards and shooters. They were the smaller team in any game. They usually played up an age group, often against powerhouse teams boasting shoe deals.

Other teams tried to woo him away.

""But he was always loyal, he'd say 'Why would I leave? I'm the captain of the ship. These are my soldiers. I'm staying with my group,'"" Cornell said. ""As it turned out, he was the type of floor general and leader to help us get past all these bigger, higher-ranked so-called AAU giants.""

Cornell has loads of stories of VanVleet's heroics from the five years he played for Pryme Time.

There was a memorable Friday night game of a major AAU tournament. Pryme Time, which was short-handed, needed to beat the Wisconsin state champions to get to the bracket round. With about 10 seconds left, one of VanVleet's teammates tried to set a pick to get him the ball.

""Fred yells 'give me the damn ball!' then Fred takes one dribble from outside the three-point line and shoots it right down the middle,"" Cornell said. ""Nothing beyond net. Walks off and says, 'I told you we wasn't going home.'""

""I think I was 10 times more excited than him, I got on the phone and called his mom, I said 'Sue, I know people say this all the time about different players, but this boy is going to the league.' I said 'You should have seen what he just did.' He shot it like ice water in his veins, like it was nothing.'""

VanVleet was the kid who only needed a foot in the door, Cornell said.

""His mindset going to tournaments was his bag was his briefcase, and this was a business trip to get him to where he intended to go in the future,"" the coach said.

VanVleet committed to Wichita State ahead of his Grade 12 year, so Shockers coach Gregg Marshall caught most of his final two AAU seasons.

""Pryme Time was this little team out of Rockford, just a bunch of dudes, a ragtag group. But they were beating all of the great shoe-company, elite AAU programs and Fred was just orchestrating the whole thing,"" Marshall said. ""I'm sitting there going, 'wow.' I mean, he's literally taking this group and winning.""

He did the same thing at Wichita State, taking the Shockers to the Final Four in 2013.

""No matter what the stage, he believes he's put in the work, and he's got the mindset and the calmness, and he's precocious if you will,"" Marshall said. ""And he just seems to will his team to be . . . the sum is better than the individual parts, right?""

VanVleet was just a freshman when he led the Shockers to an upset of Gonzaga at the 2013 NCAA tournament. With just under two minutes to play, Wichita was up by a couple of points, and VanVleet fumbled the ball toward his team's bench. He managed to retrieve it but not in time to fully turn to face the net.

""He didn't hesitate, he just shot it, and as a freshman, to take a shot like that,"" the coach marvelled. ""And as it was going through the net, he just looked at me like, 'Oh, that was good the whole way' and gave me this little shrug.

""It reminded me so much of some shots that he hit in the clinching game for the title last year.""

VanVleet, who's earning just over US$9 million this season, will be a hot commodity in free agency come October, and re-signing him should be a top priority for Toronto.

Rockford Mayor Tom McNamara believes there's no putting a pricetag on VanVleet's efforts off the court as well, and the guard's commitment to his hometown.

""Kind of weird to say about someone with such star power as Fred, but he's a better person off the court than he is a basketball player on the court,"" said the 37-year-old McNamara, whose dad John was Rockford's mayor in the '80s.

The city of 150,000 is infamous for being listed among America's most dangerous cities in past years, with a violent crime rate ranking worse than nearby Chicago.

VanVleet's roots there still run deep. He sells his 'Bet on Yourself' sportswear line out of his downtown shop. The city held viewing parties — ""our own mini-Jurassic Parks,"" said McNamara — during last year's Raptors playoff run. He was presented with a key to the city. McNamara joked the city's nickname would forever be ""Fredford.""

""He's made a lifelong Bulls fan into a Raptors fan,"" McNamara said.

VanVleet organizes annual backpack giveaways for Rockford kids. He posted a message to Rockfordians at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic urging them to stay safe. When McNamara implemented the Mayor's Office on Domestic Violence and Human Trafficking Prevention, he reached out to VanVleet for support.

""Obviously with his schedule, he can't go into every high school with me. But he did videos for us. I've never once called and asked him for anything where he's said no to, that benefits the community,"" McNamara said.

VanVleet's father — also named Fred — was shot to death in 1999 in what's been reported as a drug deal that went bad. VanVleet was five at the time, and was raised by his mom Sue and stepfather Joe Danforth, a police officer who introduced him to basketball at a young age to steer him away from trouble.

Kids in Rockford look up to VanVleet, McNamara said, but the appreciation goes beyond what he's able to do on the court.

""It's different with Fred, it's different because he is just such a class act. He is quietly, steadily showing how to just be a good human, not just an exceptional basketball player but someone who cares, and doesn't forget about where he came from,"" he said.

His story of perseverance, McNamara said, mirrors so many people of Rockford.

""He's kind of the model of what we would call 'the Rockford grit and toughness,'"" said the mayor. ""A lot of wonderful people just working exceptionally hard to excel.""

Tarasenko missed Games 3 and 4, which the Blues won to tie the series. Game 5 is Wednesday.

""He’s not feeling right, and so that’s why he’s going to get it looked at,"" coach Craig Berube said. ""It’s concerning, but we don’t know a lot yet, so I’m not going to jump to conclusions on anything.""

The 28-year-old Russian winger missed the majority of the season after having his dislocated shoulder operated on in October. He returned to the ice for training camp but had zero points and 10 shots in goal in four games since the NHL restarted and clearly didn't look like himself.

""For sure he wasn’t full out, but in saying that, I didn’t think there was anything wrong,"" Berube said. ""I understood why, coming back from surgery and nine months off. ... It’s not easy being off that long and coming back and just jumping right into it and being full out. I knew he’d come back and probably ease his way in a little bit.""

The defending Stanley Cup champions played the majority of the season without Tarasenko and were first in the Western Conference when the season was halted in March.

""The way we play, too, is pretty simple and everybody play for each other and we work hard,"" said winger Jacob de la Rose, who took Tarasenko's spot in the lineup. ""Blues hockey is get pucks deep, play hard, play good defensively and that’s what we’ve been doing here and I feel like that’s what we did all year too during the regular season, so even if we lose guys, it’s easy for a guy like me here coming into the series, too. You know what they expect of you.""

Tarasenko had 11 goals and six assists during the Blues' title run last year. He had 10 points in 10 games this season before being injured.

Berube isn't worried about not having Tarasenko for at least the next two games.

""We’re a team,"" he said. ""We play without players at times because you have to with injuries and different situations that come up. Our team is what makes us a good team. We just rely on each other and different people can come in and take people’s spots and just do the job.""

They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club.","TORONTO — Richard Clune remembers the drive — the pain, the anxiety, the uncertainty, the fear.

It was the spring of 2010 and Clune, who had made his NHL debut earlier that season, was finally on the road to getting the help the 23-year-old knew he needed in his crippling addiction battle.

article continues below

With his younger brother, Matt, at the wheel, they drove through upstate New York in a torrential downpour home to Toronto. Clune wasn't sure he was going to make it.

""I was in the acute withdrawal phase,"" he said in a recent interview with The Canadian Press. ""I couldn't sit still for a second. The most logical thing at that point in time for me was to go jump off a bridge ... literally.

""I couldn't really see myself coming out of it.""

But come out of it he did, and a decade later, Clune is sharing his story in ""Hi, My Name is Dicky,"" a raw documentary available on iTunes and AppleTV that details his life from aspiring youth hockey player to out-of-control junior antagonist to pro athlete teetering on the edge — one consumed by drugs, alcohol and mental illness.

His journey to recovery started in earnest on that lonely stretch of highway.

""My brother really had to talk me off the ledge,"" Clune said. ""When I see his face and when I see my other brother Ben's face, that's what gave me strength to live, because I didn't really want to live for myself at that time.

""Matt, at a couple points on that drive, had to do things that no younger brother should have to do and really dig down deep and get me home.""

The documentary from Taylor Prestidge and Haris Usanovic of Upper Canada Films tracks Clune's life and career, recovery and redemption. It includes interviews with Clune's parents, brothers, teammates and coaches.

Clune was driven to be the best as a child, but the pressure led him down a dark path at early age.

""I made that decision I was going to put my head down and not see anything but being a hockey player,"" Clune, who was selected in the third round of the 2005 NHL draft by the Dallas Stars, says in the film.

He began to try alcohol in his early teens as a way to cope, and it escalated quickly once he got to high school and then the Ontario Hockey League.

""I had this hole inside me that made me insecure and afraid of the world,"" Clune recounts. ""I got wasted and was like, 'Wow. OK. I'll be able to do this. I can cope with this. It's like a warm blanket.'

""Alcohol saved me. It was my solution to that problem of being self-absorbed and focused on all the things that made me insecure and self-conscious and in pain and sad.""

But he didn't realize how much of a spiral his life was taking. In junior, he would drive from bar to bar, party to party, drinking, smoking marjiuana and doing cocaine.

""I wanted to walk that line of looking death in the face every day, but still play hockey and do all these things,"" Clune says in the film. ""I don't know how I did it.""

Things got worse after junior when he was living in the United States by himself before making his NHL debut in that fateful 2009-10 season, months before becoming completely unglued.

""I had achieved my goal,"" he recalls on screen. ""But I hated myself.""

Clune eventually checked into rehab a second time — he went once before, but didn't stay — and committed to getting better with a lot of help from the people around him.

After he got out, he resumed his career and went onto play a total of 120 regular-season games in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Nashville Predators. His contract was bought out in 2015, and he was again at a crossroads — retire or keep going.

That's when the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were in the early stages of their massive rebuild, came calling to see if Clune wanted to be part of their program. They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club. At the very least, he would play in the minors and help foster a new culture.

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, who was in charge of the minor-league Marlies at the time, saw something in Clune that could be useful.

""He provides a certain energy,"" Dubas said. ""He provides experience in his life that I thought brought a great spirit to our team.""

Clune played 19 games with Leafs, but the forward truly made his mark with the Marlies. He helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018 and plans to continue his on-ice career, but equally important was how he's helped mentor a number of current NHLers.

He's proud of where he is, and not shy talking about how he got there. Clune still goes to meetings, does the 12 steps and now works to help others.

He also thinks a lot about why he made the decision to live, to fight, and get better, when many others — including some fellow pro hockey players — have gone down a different path.

""In the beginning, it was because I wanted to see my brothers,"" said Clune, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Then it transformed into wanting to live for myself. I started to discover what it feels like to have self esteem and to have love.

""I just hope people realize that they're not alone with how they feel. Don't be afraid to ask for help.""

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

""It was nice to get on the board tonight,"" said O'Reilly.

""I haven't been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it's just one game. I've got to be consistent with it.""

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

""When we take care of the puck it's effective and it's hard on them,"" said O'Reilly.

""I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We've got to stick to our structure.""

Pietrangelo said they've been working on fixing the penalty kill.

""We've been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,"" he said.

""Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.""

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

""They're blocking a lot of shots, they're studying us. They kind of know what we're doing,"" said Miller.

He said they'll make adjustments but aren't going to go back to square one.

""We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,"" he said.

""It's not like we're getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They're a good team. We're a good team. It's going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.""

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O'Reilly, last year's Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play — the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O'Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O'Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler's stick and in.

O'Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

All Western Conference games are being played in front of no fans at Rogers Place. The players are being kept isolated in a so-called bubble between games to prevent contracting COVID-19.

Cavan Biggio also went deep for the Blue Jays and finished with three hits and three RBIs.

Ryu (2-1) struck out three and walked none. The left-hander permitted only one runner past second base and yielded just one extra-base hit to a team that came in ranked second in the majors with a .467 slugging percentage.

Rather than vie for strikeouts, Ryu said he was focused more on getting the Orioles to hit the ball weakly.

""I was able to keep them off balance,"" he said through an interpreter.

Signed in December to an $80 million, four-year contract, Ryu got off to a shaky start with Toronto in July before showing the form he displayed as a star with the Dodgers. He's given up a total of two runs in his last three starts after allowing eight runs over nine innings in his first two outings.

""That was vintage Ryu,"" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. ""Ryu was outstanding. That's the reason we won the game.""

The two home runs were a factor, but mostly Ryu was the difference-maker.

""They didn’t give Ryu that big contract for nothing,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""You just never know what he’s going to throw. You don’t know what side of the plate he’s going to throw to. He’s really tough on right-handers because he can locate it in. You saw a lot of us get jammed.""

The Blue Jays took control with a four-run third against Alex Cobb (1-2). Three infield hits produced a run before Grichuk delivered a three-run drive over the centre-field wall. It was his third home run of the season, all in the last four games.

""Obviously, the pitch to Grichuk was middle middle and it was a poorly executed pitch,"" Cobb said. ""But most of the pitches that I had, I felt like I executed. I got the results.""

Cobb gave up five runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He’s winless in his last four starts.

After hitting 31 homers last year, Grichuk was batting fifth, sixth or seventh in the order this season before Montoyo decided to move him into the No. 2 spot Sunday to replace injured Bo Bichette. Over the past two games, Grichuk has two homers, four hits and six RBIs.

Pedro Severino and Renato Núñez had RBIs for the Orioles, who have dropped two straight after winning seven of eight.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Bichette (right knee sprain) had an MRI and will receive a second opinion on his injury, Montoyo said. Bichette leads Toronto with a .361 batting average.

Orioles: RH Dillon Tate (elbow contusion) came off the injured list and RH Evan Phillips was optioned to the team's alternate site.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: RH Nate Pearson (0-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his fourth start in his first big league season Tuesday night. Drafted 28th overall in 2017, the 23-year-old is looking to rebound after giving up four runs to Miami last week in 2 1/3 innings. ""I'm developing at the highest level,"" Pearson said Monday. ""When I don't have my best stuff, I'm going to struggle.""

Orioles: LH Wade LeBlanc (1-0, 7.13) has allowed a combined 10 runs over 12 innings in his last three starts.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

""We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,"" Marchand said. ""That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.""

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

""We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do — little battles,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.""

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President's Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk's first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy's hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina's captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy putaway from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston's first six post-season games.

""There's other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.""

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen's late goal.

""That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,"" Williams said. ""We got it handed to us.""

NOTES: David Pastrnak had a goal and an assist in Boston’s double-overtime win in Game 1, but hasn’t played since. He had 48 regular-season goals to tie Washington’s Alex Ovechkin for the league lead. … Carolina played without 20-year-old Andrei Svechnikov, who was injured when his leg twisted awkwardly beneath him late in the third period of Saturday's loss. ... DeBrusk scored his 12th and 13th playoff goals since his 2018 post-season debut. … The Hurricanes were also without D Joel Edmundson for the third straight game. … Jake Gardiner assisted on Williams’ first-period goal for his first post-season point with Carolina.

Former UBC Thunderbirds player Evan Holmes of Calgary led wire-to-wire over three rounds to win at eight-under amid pandemic playing conditions on the Bear, holding off former Washington State Cougars Pac-12 player Zach Anderson of Nanaimo by two strokes.

Raoul Ménard, Derek Gillespie and Yi Cao tied for third at four-under. University of Victoria Vikes golf program graduate Lawren Rowe was sixth at three-under.

Holmes said everyone has adjusted to playing amid the COVID restrictions.

“We’re all used to it by now and they seem normal,” he said after his win.

“The guidelines are here to stay for at least a little bit longer. And in the end, it’s still golf.”

The Canada Life series is a consolation for those Canadian pro golfers who missed out on the 2020 Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour season after it was cancelled due to COVID-19. That included the DC Bank Victoria Open, which has been a Tour fixture since 1981 and has featured future PGA Tour players from Steve Stricker to Tony Finau.

The two Canada Life Series tournaments on the Bear are 54-hole events. The first was on the mountain course and this week’s, from Monday to Wednesday, will be on the valley course.

A different approach and game-management outlook will be required from going to mountain to valley.

Rob Larocque, Bear Mountain director of golf, described the two courses as “quite diverse.”

“Jack and Steve [Nicklaus] designed them in such a way that we think the tournaments will certainly have different feels to them,” said Larocque.

Both Bear Mountain tournaments feature purses of $50,000 and both filled up fast with lengthy waiting lists.

Holmes pocketed $9,000 for his win last week and an additional $2,750 bonus for recording the low round. The latter perk is provided by current and former Canadian PGA Tour players Adam Hadwin, Corey Conners, Nick Taylor, Mackenzie Hughes, Roger Sloan, Michael Gligic, Graham DeLaet, Stephen Ames, David Hearn, Mike Weir and Ian Leggatt to help out the next generation.

The Canada Life Series concludes Sept. 2-4 and Sept. 9-11 at TPC Toronto at Osprey Valley. The series champion over the four tournaments will earn a berth into the 2021 RBC Canadian Open at St. George’s in Toronto.

“I would love to be in the Canadian Open, but I have to focus over the next three tournaments,” said Holmes.

He will get that chance beginning Monday.

The Canada Life Series is adhering to the safety guidelines being practised elsewhere in golf’s re-opening. Spectators are not allowed for the two Bear Mountain tournaments. There are no caddies and only a bare number of volunteers allowed on the Bear.

The Canada Life tournaments have been put together by the Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour Canada, which is the launching pad to the Korn Ferry Tour, which in turn is the entry portal to the PGA Tour. The Mackenzie Tour’s alumni includes 41 PGA Tour players and 232 Korn Ferry Tour players produced since 2013.

These are the first pro tournaments on Bear Mountain since the mountain course hosted PGA Tour Champions’ events in 2016 and 2017. The $2.5-million Pacific Links tournaments featured former stars and current seniors such as Colin Montgomerie, John Daly, Bernhard Langer, Vijay Singh, Scott McCarron, Jerry Kelly and Lee Janzen.

The flow was a bit rusty, as to be expected following a delay of four months, but also entertaining as Pacific FC and HFX Wanderers opened their Canadian Premier League accounts with an eventful 2-2 draw in Charlottetown, P.E.I.

article continues below

Both teams will rue not winning Saturday’s contest, in which posts were hit and balls cleared off the line by both sides. It looked to be the Nova Scotia-based Wanderers’ game to lose for two-thirds of it with a 1-0 lead. Then Island-based PFC scored twice, before a late penalty kick by HFX tied it 2-2.

“I thought we created the most but were not effective enough to punish them,” said PFC head coach Pa-Modou Kah.

Both HFX goals came on book-end penalty kicks through Brazilian and former Middlesbrough player Joao Neto Morelli at 12 minutes and Ibrahima Sanoh at 86 minutes.

“People were a bit rusty and not used to those situations [defensively],” said Kah.

“That causes it. But that is a part of football. Football is about mistakes. Unfortunately, we made them today and it cost us three points.”

Overall, however, the PFC bench boss was pleased, considering the circumstances of the pandemic delaying the start of the season.

“We have not played in 200-odd days, and to perform like that, is incredible,” said Kah.

""Our team performed brilliantly but was just unlucky. The game is about momentum and the early [HFX] penalty goal took a little of that away from us. We stuck together and had the fight to take the lead. Unfortunately, we allowed the late penalty. We will take a lesson out of it.”

Goals by sophomore Zach Verhoven at 67 minutes and six-times Canada-capped Marco Bustos at 75 minutes had given PFC the lead.

“It was a great feeling to play an actual game,” said Bustos, who scored seven goals last season for Valour FC of Winnipeg.

“We want to create chances as a team, which we did, in scoring two goals from open play. And we will only get better as time goes on.”

All games are being played on the University of Prince Edward Island’s FIFA-standard Alumni Field turf facility sans fans amid the CPL’s “bubble” after Charlottetown beat out Langford and Moncton, N.B., to host the CPL season tournament.

""We showed good character the way we clawed back,” said HFX head coach Stephen Hart.

“We showed good mental spirit. The game was fairly balanced. We would have loved to have gotten the three points, but so would they [PFC].”

Hart said his team’s two goals from the spot were earned.

“You only get penalty kicks for attacking,” said the former Canadian national team head coach.

Each of the eight teams will play the other once in the round-robin portion of the made-for-TV tournament. PFC’s other games are against York9 on Tuesday at 10 a.m., Forge FC of Hamilton next Saturday at 1 p.m., Valour FC of Winnipeg on Aug. 25 at 11 a.m., Cavalry FC of Calgary on Aug. 30 at 9 a.m., Atletico Ottawa on Sept. 2 at 5 p.m. and FC Edmonton on Sept. 6 at noon. All times are PDT.

The top-four teams will advance to a playoff-round robin. The top team from that will go directly into the league championship game while the second- and third-place teams will meet in a semifinal with the winner advancing to the championship final.

All games will be broadcast live over the Web on OneSoccer while CBC is broadcasting doubleheaders nationally on Saturdays.

“The hotel is great and they have given us lots to do, so we are not bored,” said de Jong.","Pacific FC captain Marcel de Jong says it’s all a matter of perspective. He prefers to look at pandemic soccer “as much as an adventure as a challenge.”

De Jong has played in the Bundesliga, Dutch Premiership, MLS and has been capped 56 times for Canada. He has been through a lot on fields across the world, but no one has been through anything like this before. His attitude is: It’s here, it’s a fact, so you might as well get used to it.

“I’ve seen a lot of football in my career, but this is a first,” he said.

“But we are still doing what we love to do most, which is play football. And in the end, that’s all that matters.”

De Jong leads Island-based Pacific FC into its opening 2020 Canadian Premier League game today against the HFX Wanderers of Halifax (noon PDT on CBC).

“We haven’t seen anybody play except [2019 CPL finalists Forge FC of Hamilton and Cavalry FC of Calgary who opened the tournament Thursday], so basically, every opposition team is a mystery,” said de Jong.

“We are just in the mindset of playing our game and concentrating on ourselves and our play.”

De Jong will anchor a solid PFC backline. But the team’s strength appears to be a forward-thinking, pressing and attacking midfield likely to consist of Victor Blasco, Marco Bustos, Jamar Dixon, Noah Verhoeven and Zach Verhoven.

“We have a dynamic team that will be looking to control the play with high pressure and getting the ball back as soon as we lose it,” said de Jong. “You will not see any long balls, but only good and attractive football from us. I believe we have the performers who can play that way.”

That type of approach takes energy.

“There are a lot of games over a short period of time,” de Jong said. “So the allowing of more subs [five per game compared with the usual three] will very much help in that regard. Everybody is going to get their chance through this tournament.”

Each of the eight teams will play the other once in the round-robin portion of the made-for-TV tournament.

Each player was tested for COVID in their home communities and again upon landing in Charlottetown. All tests among CPL players, coaches and staff have been negative.

This is the second year for the long-awaited Canadian domestic pro soccer league, mandated by FIFA, as part of Canada hosting the 2026 World Cup with the U.S. and Mexico. No one could have anticipated the sophomore CPL being played in this abbreviated fashion amid a pandemic.

“The hotel is great and they have given us lots to do, so we are not bored,” said de Jong.

He certainly won’t be bored today.

Each club will play 12 round-robin games. The semifinals and finals will be held at the Q Centre in Colwood on dates to be announced.

The tournament will adhere to current B.C. guidelines and a maximum of 50 people — including players, coaches and scorekeepers — will be in the rinks for the games.

“This is all dependent on the health authorities,” said Grizzlies GM and head coach Craig Didmon. “If it can’t happen, then we will continue practising and training until the start of the regular season.”

The BCHL regular season is targeted to begin Dec. 1. The Grizzlies will open training camp on Sept. 15 with Didmon expecting to have 30 players on hand.

Current B.C. guidelines allow for training in small groups, so teams in various sports have been breaking up practice sessions into allowable units and staggering ice, field or court times.

“That’s just the way it is and you have to accept it because this is an unusual time,” said Didmon. “The BCHL has done a good job of managing its way through this situation.”

The league is a leading producer of hockey talent for U.S. collegiate NCAA Div. 1 teams.

The pandemic year has tested everyone’s resolve and commitment. “Nobody has seen anything like this before,” said PFC head coach Pa-Modou Kah.

“This has been about more than sports. It’s been about life, and what you choose for yourself. It's about character and persistence and sticking it out, which these players have done.”

He led wire-to-wire over three rounds to win the Canada Life pro golf tournament Wednesday amid pandemic playing conditions on Bear Mountain.

The former UBC Thunderbirds player from Calgary began with a scorching opening-round 63 on Monday and closed it out from there to hold off former Washington State Cougars Pac-12 player Zach Anderson of Nanaimo.

Holmes finished at eight-under, two strokes clear of runner-up Anderson.

“The course got tougher over the last two rounds as the wind started to swirl,” said Holmes.

“But I was able to hold off Zach and bring it home.”

Holmes said everyone has adjusted to playing amid the COVID1-19 restrictions. “We’re all used to it by now and the new rules seem normal,” he said.

“The guidelines are here to stay for at least a little bit longer. And in the end, it’s still just golf.”

The Canada Life series is a consolation for those Canadian pro golfers who missed out on the 2020 Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour season after it was cancelled due to COVID-19. That included the DC Bank Victoria Open, which has been a Tour fixture since 1981, and has featured future PGA Tour players from Steve Stricker to Tony Finau

This week’s tournament on the mountain course was the first of two Canada Life Series 54-hole events at Bear Mountain. The second tournament is on the valley course next Monday through Wednesday. Both events feature purses of $50,000 and both filled up fast with lengthy waiting lists.

Holmes pocketed $9,000 for the win plus an additional $2,750 bonus for recording the low round. The latter bonus is paid for by current and past Canadian PGA Tour players to help the next generation.

“It feels good — it was a nice day — especially considering the [abbreviated season],” Holmes said.

The Canada Life Series concludes Sept. 2-4 and Sept. 9-11 at TPC Toronto at Osprey Valley. The series champion over the four tournaments will earn a berth into the 2021 RBC Canadian Open at St. George’s in Toronto, which is a nice perk.

“I would love to be in the Canadian Open, but I have to focus over the next three tournaments,” said Holmes.

The Canada Life Series is adhering to the safety guidelines being practised elsewhere in golf’s reopening. Spectators are not allowed for the two Bear Mountain tournaments. There are no caddies and only a bare number of volunteers allowed on the Bear.

The Canada Life tournaments have been put together by the Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour Canada, which is the launching pad to the Korn Ferry Tour, which in turn is the entry portal to the PGA Tour. The Mackenzie Tour’s alumni includes 41 PGA Tour players and 232 Korn Ferry Tour players produced since 2013.

""It was disappointing when circumstances surrounding COVID-19 required us to cancel the 2020 Mackenzie Tour season,” said Tour executive director Scott Pritchard. “But we never lost sight of the purpose for this Tour, which is to give players opportunities.”

Island players in the first Bear Mountain tournament included Anderson from the Harbour City, Lawren Rowe, Cory Renfrew, Jim Rutledge, Peter Jenkins and Nate Ollis of Victoria, Andrew Funk of Sidney, Callum Davison of Duncan and Travis Busch of Qualicum Beach. A pleasant surprise was Jenkins of the host club moving up 15 spots in the second round Tuesday to make the cut to play in Wednesday’s final round. The 22-year-old was among two sponsor exemptions awarded Bear Mountain and Jenkins more than proved he belonged. Bear Mountain held a qualifying tournament for its members and staff to decide who would get its two exempt slots.

It was the first pro tournament on Bear Mountain since the mountain course hosted PGA Tour Champions’ events in 2016 and 2017. The $2.5-million Pacific Links tournaments featured former stars and current seniors such as Colin Montgomerie, John Daly, Bernhard Langer, Vijay Singh, Scott McCarron, Jerry Kelly and Lee Janzen.

Next week’s second tournament switches from the mountain to the valley course and will offer the Canada Life Series golfers a vastly different challenge.

Rob Larocque, Bear Mountain director of golf, described the two courses as “quite diverse.”

“Jack and Steve [Nicklaus] designed them in such a way that we think the tournaments will certainly have different feels to them,” said Larocque.

John McCain of Arizona.

She’s just the latest Republican to join in the convention, after a number of notable GOP former elected officials — including former Ohio Gov. John Kasich — endorsed the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee on Monday night. It's a continuation of a major theme that Democrats have pushed through the first night of the convention — an effort to broaden the party's appeal to occasional Republicans and disaffected Trump voters.

In an advance clip from the video shared with The Associated Press, Cindy McCain talks about how Biden, then a Delaware senator, met her husband when John McCain was assigned to be a military aide for him on a trip overseas. The two became friends, and the families would gather for picnics in the Bidens’ backyard.

""They would just sit and joke. It was like a comedy show, sometimes, to watch the two of them,"" she says in the clip.

Cindy McCain is not expected to offer an explicit endorsement, but her involvement in the video is her biggest public show of support yet for Biden’s candidacy. McCain was the 2008 Republican presidential nominee against Democrat Barack Obama, who won the election with Biden as his vice-presidential running mate.

Both Cindy McCain and her daughter Meghan have been outspoken critics of President Donald Trump, and the family is longtime friends with the Bidens. Trump targeted John McCain personally in 2015, saying the former prisoner of war wasn't a hero ""because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured."" McCain later angered Trump with his dramatic thumbs-down vote against repealing President Barack Obama’s health care law.

When McCain died on a Saturday in 2018, the Trump administration lowered the American flag over the White House to half-staff but then raised it by Monday. After public outcry, the White House flags were again lowered. Trump wasn't invite to McCain's funeral.

Biden consoled Meghan McCain on an appearance on ""The View"" after her father was diagnosed with the cancer that eventually took his life. She has said Biden often reaches out to her to offer support, after losing his own son Beau to the same cancer in 2015.

But while Meghan suggested in April she’d be voting for Biden, Cindy has pointedly stayed out of the presidential race. In April of last year, amid rumours that the McCains would wade into the election in support of Biden, Cindy McCain tweeted that Biden is ""a wonderful man and a dear friend of the McCain family.""

""However,"" she added at the time, ""I have no intention of getting involved in presidential politics.""

The video on Biden's friendship with McCain is one of a series of short documentaries created by Oscar Award-winning director Davis Guggenheim, who worked on ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" the 2006 documentary on climate change that featured former Vice-President Al Gore. On Monday night, Guggenheim’s short film focused on Biden’s relationship with the Amtrak conductor and workers on the trains he took from Delaware to Washington as senator aired during the convention."

University president the Rev. John Jenkins said there have been 147 confirmed cases of coronavirus on campus since the start of classes for the university’s approximately 12,000 students.

Jenkins said he decided against sending students home after consulting with the St. Joseph County Health Department. Instead, university officials decided steps could be taken short of closing the campus while still protecting students' health and safety.

The university is advising off-campus students not to visit the campus and on-campus students not to venture off-campus and is restricting student gatherings to 10 people or less. The university is allowing graduate student access to research laboratories and libraries. Athletic teams subject to surveillance testing can continue to gather for sanctioned activities, but will be closely monitored.

""The virus is a formidable foe,"" Jenkins said in announcing enhanced testing for students experiencing symptoms and surveillance testing for those without symptoms. ""For the past week, it has been winning. Let us as the Fighting Irish join together to contain it.""

According to Jenkins, the university has traced the spike in COVID-19 cases to off-campus gatherings where neither masks were worn nor physical distancing observed. He said students infected at those gatherings passed it on to others, who in turn passed the virus on to others, resulting in the positive cases, with all but one a student.

Jenkins asked students to help in identifying others who have been flagrantly violating safety protocols.

The action by Notre Dame follows the decision by officials of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to switch to remote learning starting Wednesday, and is making arrangements for students who want to leave campus housing. UNC officials said clusters of COVID-19 were discovered in dorms, a fraternity house and other student housing.

Coronavirus outbreaks earlier this summer at fraternities in Washington state, California and Mississippi provided a glimpse of the challenges school officials face in keeping the virus from spreading on campuses where young people gather in close quarters.

The virus has been blamed for over 170,000 deaths and 5.4 million confirmed infections in the U.S."

As Democrats gathered virtually, Trump targeted voters in a pair of key swing states and sought to curry favour with women voters by pardoning Susan B. Anthony, a leader in the women’s suffrage movement.

In Arizona, one of the top 2020 battleground states, the president sought to paint a Biden victory in apocalyptic terms, insisting ""the survival of our nation is at stake"" in November, as he slammed what he hyperbolically labeled the ""insane and lethal policies"" of his opposition.

""Biden’s plan is the most radical, extreme, reckless, dangerous and deadly immigration plan ever put forward by a major party candidate,"" he said. ""It must be defeated. and it will be defeated on November 3.""

Trump repeatedly mischaracterized Biden’s views on immigration, which are more centrist than many others in his party. Biden, for instance, does not support abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and he argues that crossing the U.S. border illegally should be criminally prosecuted rather than made a civil offence, as many other top Democratic presidential hopefuls proposed.

With his second campaign trip in two days, Trump was hoping to halt an expected convention polling bump for his rival and shore up support with his focus on immigration, one of the most important issues to his political base. He was also trying to stanch an erosion in support among female voters with a symbolic nod on the centennial of the ratification of the 19th Amendment.

In recent weeks, Trump has been trying to build support within the pivotal female voter constituency and has stepped up his events aimed at women. His campaign has launched another ""women for Trump"" bus tour, and the president has embraced a ""law and order"" message with renewed vigour.

The president also worked in a last-minute stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, for a briefing about damage from the derecho last week that has left thousands without power and caused catastrophic damage across the battleground state. Many there have expressed outrage that their plight has not received more national attention.

The storm, which packed 100 mph winds and similar power to an inland hurricane, blew down trees, flipped vehicles and caused widespread damage.

""We’ve come through for you, and we will always come through for Iowa,"" Trump said, as the city's mayor urged him to consider enhanced federal disaster funding for people there.

Trump highlighted his immigration agenda during his stop in Yuma, and got an update on construction of his southern border wall. The president insisted that, in addition to fulfilling his pledge to build the wall, Mexico was also paying for it — even though they’re not.

""They are paying for it,"" he said as he stood in front of a replica of his wall, telling reporters he’s planning to enact a border crossing toll at some point in the future.

""Mexico will be paying,"" he said. ""We’re figuring how much we have to charge.""

Before leaving Washington, Trump held a White House event to announce the pardon of Anthony, convicted of voting in 1872 in violation of laws permitting only men to vote. But he quickly pivoted to the upcoming election and the issue of voting by mail.

""Win, lose or draw, we have to get it right,"" Trump said of the November vote count, levelling a fresh offensive against mail-in voting.

""You can’t have millions and millions of ballots sent all over the place, sent to people that are dead, sent to dogs, cats, sent everywhere,"" Trump said.

In fact, voter fraud has proved exceedingly rare. The Brennan Center for Justice in 2017 ranked the risk of ballot fraud at 0.00004% to 0.0009%, based on studies of past elections.

Only nine states have plans for ""universal"" mail-in voting, in which ballots are sent automatically to registered voters. Five of those states relied on mail-in ballots even before the coronavirus pandemic raised concerns about voting in person.

Trump's pardon announcement came on the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which ensured women the right to vote. The amendment states, ""The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex."" Congress passed it in 1919, and the amendment was ratified on Aug. 18, 1920.

Anthony was arrested for voting in Rochester, New York, and convicted in a widely publicized trial. Although she refused to pay the fine, the authorities declined to take further action.

""She felt the trial was the greatest miscarriage of justice because she had not had an opportunity to have a jury of her peers, and the jury didn’t get to vote,"" according to Deborah L. Hughes, president and CEO of The National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House in Rochester, where Anthony died in 1906.

""So to pardon her is to validate the trial, and she would not buy that idea at all,"" Hughes said.

Hughes said the question to ask on the anniversary is how she would want to be honoured. ""She would be the first to say if any president wanted to honour her, the best way to do that is to make sure there is no voter suppression anywhere in the United States,"" Hughes said.

Preparations for Trump's own acceptance speech next week were under way at the White House, where a stage was being erected on the South Lawn.

As was the case Monday in Minnesota and Wisconsin, Trump did not venture beyond the airports in Iowa or Arizona — a reflection of the new realities of campaigning in the midst of a pandemic. But Trump's Yuma rally felt much like his rallies of old, with a tightly packed crowd of hundreds shouting and cheering — though many were wearing ""TRUMP"" and ""MAGA"" masks.

Reduced opportunities for spending during the lockdown may have contributed to the drop, said TransUnion's Matt Fabian, but he also noted that people are dipping into savings or retirement funds rather than relying on credit cards.

""Recent feedback from our survey seems like the folks that say they're still experiencing a lot of financial hardship continues to drop. And there's a lot more certainty in terms of the response, in terms of what they're going to do. Consumers have fortified themselves,"" said Fabian.

TransUnion uses the credit bureaus' national consumer credit database as source material for its quarterly report.

Applications for new credit also grew at a slower-than-usual pace amid reduced access to branches during the lockdown, uncertainty around employment and a pullback on new offers from lenders.

The report did note that credit balances for Millennials and Gen Z consumers grew 0.8 per cent and 5.9 per cent, respectively, as those consumers have less buffer in the form of savings, investments or retirement funds. Overall instalment loan debt also rose by 3.9 per cent in the second quarter to $175.4 billion, up from $168.8 billion a year ago.

Mortgage debt is on the rise, TransUnion said, with new mortgages, renewals and refinances up 29 per cent from a year ago and a 5.3 per cent annual increase in the total volume of mortgage debt.

""The spring, that's usually the big mortgage season or the big home buying season. With people not being able to go out, and constraints around travelling and visiting homes and looking at new homes, once some of those lock downs were lifted, we've seen sort of a real surge,"" Fabian said.

""Certainly for some consumers that have existing mortgages, deferrals were an option, and a lot of consumers opted to take it … certainly for a lot of people, a mortgage might be one of the biggest monthly or biweekly expenses that they'd have.""

Despite a 4.3 per cent rise in total outstanding debt in Canada, which stood at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter, Fabian says delinquencies have risen less than expected, as about 2.6 million Canadians, or 9.2 per cent of credit consumers, have at least one active deferral.

Delinquencies also were on the rise for personal loans, which TransUnion noted are ""partly fuelled by alternative lenders who have been slightly more aggressive in issuing personal loans to below prime consumers.""

""We have seen delinquency rates go up a little bit, but a lot less than we had expected… and I think part of that is the deferral and forbearance processes that are in place with the lenders as well as the support from the government,"" said Fabian.

""Delinquency tends to be a long-tail thing where it takes a while. People have exhaust all their options before they will start to continuously skip and miss payments. As deferrals come off and the government subsidization ends, we expect to see some delinquency spike.""

Chrystia Freeland, who was sworn in Tuesday afternoon after Bill Morneau resigned late Monday, will have to manage a COVID-19 recovery that is still very much under way, with more than 40 per cent of the three million workers who lost jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic still unemployed as of mid-July.

The path forward for jobless Canadians is still taking shape. Fewer than one-third of the 4.7 million people who were receiving the $2,000-per-month Canada Emergency Response Benefit at the beginning of August would qualify for Employment Insurance when CERB ends on Sept. 26, according to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, though the government has promised to ease EI eligibility rules.

The unemployment rate currently sits at 10.9 per cent, according to Statistics Canada's July labour force survey, which noted almost twice as many people were unemployed than in February.

Meanwhile, the spectre of protectionism continues to loom large after U.S. President Donald Trump reimposed tariffs on Canadian aluminum earlier this month — Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden also harbours protectionist sentiments — further complicating trade relationships.

Key to the task of drafting a budget will be weighing whether to patch up a frayed social safety net or to broaden it with reinforced rope.

""There are huge challenges in terms of how our social safety net has actually been exposed through COVID to be kind of thin and narrow,"" said Sheila Block, a senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.

""Years and years of underinvestment in public services have really come back to bite us.""

Potential changes to employment insurance — thresholds for hours worked, payment amounts and inclusion of self-employed and gig economy workers — fall under the purview of the employment minister, ""but eventually it lands on the finance minister,"" Block said.

Debt presents another dilemma for Freeland. Ottawa has been pumping money into the economy since March, resulting in a projected debt of $343 billion, an increase of more than 1,000 per cent from the previous year.

Much of that spending has gone toward a federal wage subsidy for troubled businesses, which has been extended until at least December. Further extensions and tweaks to the program — it will cost the government an estimated $67.9 billion through the end of the year, according to a report last week by the Parliamentary Budget Office — will rest largely in Freeland's hands.

Fiscal policy is already running ""at full throttle,"" said Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter, with the 2020-21 federal debt-to-GDP ratio headed about 49 per cent compared to 31 per cent currently.

The longer-term issue is whether the surge in spending linked to the coronavirus will morph into a more permanent trend, with attendant tax and debt implications, he said.

Despite a drastic uptick, the debt-to-GDP ratio remains well below danger zones highlighted by the International Monetary Fund and the highs of the mid-1990s, when it reached two-thirds.

Interest rates are also at historic lows, which means the borrowed cash comes cheap.

Morneau's resignation could portend a doubling down on a ""'fairness' agenda,"" with ""more fiscal activism"" the likely outcome, said Derek Holt, vice-president at Scotiabank Economics.

""The timing works well, as resigning in August gives plenty of time for a material shift in the fiscal stance before the unconfirmed fall budget or update and Throne Speech,"" Holt said in a research note.

The Business Council of Canada on Tuesday urged the government to set clear fiscal targets and rein in spending given a projected net debt in 2020-21 of $1.2 trillion, saying in a letter to Freeland that ""interest rates will rise eventually.""

CEO Goldy Hyder said there is an ""urgent need"" for Ottawa to pivot to an ""economic growth and prosperity agenda,"" with an eye to structural issues ranging from an aging population and climate change to ""regulatory obstacles that go well beyond pipelines.""

Freeland brings to the table a background steeped in financial journalism — she penned the 2012 book ""Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else"" — and delicate trade negotiations with the U.S. during her nearly two-year stint as foreign affairs minister.

""Her communication skills and prior background as a financial journalist and policy wonk will serve her well in the role as will her global mindset. Freeland could well be the country’s best — if not only — chance at a female prime minister within a reasonable time horizon,"" Holt said.

Some previous finance ministers have landed in the role after prominent business careers, including Morneau and Paul Martin, but others such as Jean Chretien, Jim Flaherty and John Manley took on the title without any executive experience.

""Being a titan of industry in particular in these times is not necessarily the best qualification for a finance minister,"" Block said, citing inequality and the pandemic as the towering economic issues of the day.

""I think there’s a great deal of uncertainty, and that’s something that the finance minister will also have to deal with.""

In documents filed by her court-appointed lawyer that give a rare public airing to the wishes of the 38-year-old pop superstar, she asked that her father not return to the role of conservator of her person, which gave him power over her major life decisions from 2008 until 2019, when he temporarily stepped aside, citing health problems.

article continues below

""Britney is strongly opposed to James return as conservator of her person,"" the document says.

James Spears has kept his separate role as conservator over his daughter's finances. For the first 11 years of the conservatorship, he served as co-conservator with attorney Andrew M. Wallet, who resigned from the role early last year.

That briefly left James Spears with sole power over Britney Spears' life, money and career, a situation she says she very much wants to avoid repeating.

An email seeking comment from James Spears' attorney was not immediately returned.

Spears says she wants Jodi Montgomery, who has been serving as conservator of her person temporarily, to do so permanently, but she says that doesn't mean she is waiving her right to seek an end to the entire arrangement.

The documents also reveal that Britney Spears has no plans to perform again anytime soon. She last performed live in October 2018, and early in 2019, cancelled a planned Las Vegas residency.

The filing gave a rare glimpse at Britney Spears' own wishes in the conservatorship that has had vast power over her for over a decade. She has almost never spoken publicly about the matter, and court hearings and documents in the case are cloaked in secrecy, though last year she addressed the court at her request, suggesting she was seeking changes.

In the papers, Britney Spears praises the conservatorship and its work overall, saying it ""rescued her from a collapse, exploitation by predatory individuals and financial ruin"" and that it made her ""able to regain her position as a world class entertainer.""

The document was filed a day before a status hearing on the conservatorship, expected to be closed to the media and public.

Britney Spears' attorney said that he expects James Spears will aggressively contest being marginalized, and said that Britney Spears has suggested they retain a lawyer with expertise in complex financial court fights.

The conservatorship, known in some states as a guardianship, gave James Spears power over his daughter's career choices and much of her personal life, including her relationship with her teenage sons. Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline has custody of the boys, but she has frequent visits with them.

When you are The Killers and your usual guitarist has gone, no problem. When you’re The Killers you can turn to Lindsey Buckingham.

article continues below

The former Fleetwood Mac guitarist steps in for a tune on the new 10-song ""Imploding the Mirage,"" another sign of the band’s clout. The album's guests also include k.d. lang and Adam Granduciel of The War on Drugs.

The absence of guitarist and co-founder Dave Keuning is felt, with keyboards and drums stepping into the void. Without Keuning’s jangle and riff shards, The Killers have a more poppy sound.

If 2017's ""Wonderful Wonderful"" was a meditation on the anxiety of masculinity, the new album often explores the lives of women, with two sharp portraits of tough survivors in ""Blowback"" and ""Caution"" — women whom Brandon Flowers sings each come from ""white trash.""

Many other songs are about loyally backing a partner. ""I’ll be there when water’s rising/I’ll be your lifeguard,"" Flowers sings on ""Dying Breed."" On ""When the Dreams Run Dry,"" he vows: ""I’ll be on your side/When the dreams run dry."" In ""Lightening Fields,"" he sings, ""Just wanted to run my fastest/And stand beside you."" The cover of the album depicts a god tenderly supporting a goddess.

Jonathan Rado of California psychedelic-rock duo Foxygen and Shawn Everett — who worked on ""Wonderful Wonderful"" as well as with Kacey Musgraves and Alabama Shakes — have stepped in to produce and their influence can best be heard on the funky ""Fire in Bone.""

Elsewhere, listeners may have fun finding the band's other influences. There's a Tom Petty-ish sound to ""Blowback"" and ""My Own Soul's Warning"" has a Springsteen vibe. But there's no mistaking that classic Killers mix of soaring vocals, sonic bombast and sly humour in such songs as ""My God"" and the title track. It's a solid album from a band still exploring.

""This is me. I am 'Pipe Nation,'"" she said with a laugh Monday during an interview with The Canadian Press in Sundre, Alta., a picturesque oil town nestled near the Rocky Mountains.

article continues below

""I've been working in the oil and gas industry for about six years. I took a break when the bust happened and did a little serving, a little bartending but always went back to the oil and gas,"" added Gamble, who is 24.

""My father, my grandfather and my great grandfather were all in the oil and gas industry as well.""

Sundre is set to become the fictional community of Hardwell. The drama will focus on day-to-day hardships labourers face, with Gamble's character as the leader of a pipe gang — workers who position and align the pipe, preparing it for the weld. In real life, Gamble has held a number of jobs in the industry including welding.

But this is her first acting part since middle school.

""I always wanted to become an actor because I always thought pretending to be someone and falling into a character is a lot of fun and being someone else,"" she said.

""Unfortunately that's not the direction I went to until now when I got handed this beautiful opportunity that my little-girl dream could come true.""

Filmmaker and director Raoul Bhatt says he wanted a mix of both professional and amateur actors on set, and he's not concerned about the lack of experience from some of his cast members. He sees it as an asset to the project.

""I needed this to be believable and I needed someone with a certain language, a certain grit, combined with people who have actor experience,"" said Bhatt, adding 480 people showed up for the casting call. ""I wanted someone who's believable, honest, sincere and lives in the moment.""

Bhatt, who grew up in Edmonton, has a soft spot for the energy sector and says the show is meant to spotlight the colourful nature of the individuals.

""They're just beautiful people and to showcase that beyond the Dow Jones, beyond just the oil and gas numbers to human struggle, conditions and overcoming adversity and the determination of these characters is what the show is about,"" he said.

Bhatt, a software engineer who self-funded the pilot, has worked as a cinematographer and producer for the Daytime Emmys, as well as with Universal Studios' ""Jurassic World"" and a number of music videos.

He understands there are plenty of people out there who are not fans of the oil and gas industry.

""We are leaning toward pro but again that's for the viewer to decide. If you're against the oil and gas industry that's your opinion but I really hope this creates an emotional connection with the characters.""

Filming of the pilot will be completed by the end of August. Bhatt said he is in negotiations with a couple of streaming services for a 10-episode season.

A storage lot for oilfield equipment in Sundre is one of the regular sets. In addition, a portion of farmland in Sundre has been cleared for the actual building of a mini pipeline to add to the realism of the show.

Bhatt isn't short on technical advisers. Gin Ford, who plays the character Dee, has been a pipeline welder for the past 10-plus years. She has no acting experience but intends to use the show as a vessel for female empowerment and women in the energy industry.

""I'm not here for fame or recognition. I am actually here to make a voice for women in trades. Here's the moment for me to be a voice,"" said Ford.

""I've been called the pipeline princess and it's like, you can roll onto site and right way it's 'this girl's out here to work?'"" she said.

""I definitely want to highlight you can look like you want and you can still work in a male-dominated industry. It doesn't matter if you've got the nails, the lashes, the hair or the Barbie image.""

Ford said the show is meant to be raw, but it's not reality TV or a documentary.

""I'm not going to lie. My mom's probably going to tell me to wash my mouth out with some soap,"" Ford said, noting her character is tough-talking, confident and keeps up with the guys.

Mike Vickers plays Ryan, an East Coaster who moved to Alberta to make his fortune in the oil industry. Art imitates life for Vickers who moved to Alberta from Cape Breton.

""When I read the script it was my life. I fell in love with this. It's going to really showcase that true oil and gas grit, the struggles we all face and how we overcome it together as a family,"" Vickers said.

""There's so much opportunity to better the image of this industry and it's how we all come together is how we're going to do this and tell this story.""

Filming in Sundre is expected to wrap up by Aug. 24 and will finish in Nisku, south of Edmonton, by the end of the month.

Neither Cassirer's heirs nor Spain's Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum dispute the painting's early history.
Both U.S. District Judge John Walter, in a 2019 ruling, and the appeals court in Tuesday's, criticized the baron and the Spanish foundation for not doing more to discover whether the painting was looted art.
Both courts also criticized Spain for not living up to what the courts called ""moral commitments"" to return Nazi-looted art.
But that is the state of the law,"" the appeals court said in its ruling.","LOS ANGELES — A U.S. appeals court has ruled that a Camille Pissarro painting a Jewish woman traded to the Nazis to escape the Holocaust in 1939 may remain the property of a Spanish museum that acquired it more than a half-century later.

The unanimous ruling issued Monday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest — but possibly not the last — in a case that has wound through the courts of Spain and the United States for 20 years.

article continues below

At stake is ""La Rue St. Honoré, effet de Soleil, Après-Midi, 1898,"" an oil-on-canvas work of a rain-swept Paris street that Pissarro painted as he gazed at the scene from his hotel window. Its value has been estimated at $30 million.

Lilly Cassirer’s father-in-law bought it directly from Pissarro’s art dealer and left it to her and her husband when he died. In 1939, she traded it to the Nazis in exchange for exit visas for herself, her husband and her grandson, who eventually settled in the U.S. Her great-grandson, David Cassirer of San Diego, has continued the litigation since his father's death.

Neither Cassirer's heirs nor Spain's Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum dispute the painting's early history.

What's at issue all these years later is whether Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza made any serious effort to determine the painting was looted art when he acquired it from a New York gallery owner for $275,000 in 1976.

Also whether Spanish curators did their due diligence in tracing its provenance when a Spanish non-profit foundation acquired it and hundreds of other paintings from the baron's collection in 1992 and created the Madrid museum that bears his name.

Lilly Cassirer’s heirs say she spent years trying to recover the painting before concluding it was lost and accepting $13,000 in reparations from the German government in 1958.

It wasn’t until 1999 that her grandson, Claude, who had vividly recalled seeing it hanging in the family's German home, discovered it in the Madrid museum. After Spain refused to hand it over, he sued.

Attorney Thaddeus Stauber, who has represented the museum since the case reached U.S. courts in 2005, hailed Monday's decision, noting that the painting was sold and resold to numerous legitimate and prominent collectors over the years before the baron obtained it, with none discovering it had been seized by the Nazis.

He said there also appeared to be no effort by Thyssen-Bornemisza or any other collector to hide it from the public.

""We've been transparent from the start of this case, and we're very pleased that there's been a trial now and it brings it to a conclusion, we trust,"" he said Tuesday.

He did say the Cassirer family may appeal to the full 9th Circuit or even the U.S. Supreme Court.

The family did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday, but the president of the Holocaust Survivors Foundation USA denounced the decision.

""The Nazis murdered more than 6 million Jews, including 1.5 million children under the age of 12, and including 105 members of my family,"" David Schaecter said. ""How on God’s Earth can Spain fight so hard to deny a Jewish family its precious legacy that was looted by the Nazis? And how on God’s Earth can an American court ignore the unprecedented trauma of the Holocaust and reward Spain for its greed?""

Both U.S. District Judge John Walter, in a 2019 ruling, and the appeals court in Tuesday's, criticized the baron and the Spanish foundation for not doing more to discover whether the painting was looted art. But both courts concluded there was no proof either deliberately hid that it was.

Both courts also criticized Spain for not living up to what the courts called ""moral commitments"" to return Nazi-looted art.

""It is perhaps unfortunate that a country and a government can preen as moralistic in its declarations, yet not be bound by those declarations. But that is the state of the law,"" the appeals court said in its ruling."

Even so, back-to-school shopping doesn't have to be more expensive than any other year, said Seung Hwan (Mark) Lee, an associate professor of retail management at Ryerson University.

""Find out more about what your school district is doing, and then adjust according to that.","TORONTO — Vonny Sweetland has yet to decide if he will be sending his 12-year-old sister Josephine back to class in September, but just in case he does, he's been stocking up on supplies for months.

He picks up hand sanitizer when he sees it in stores, grabbed new masks last month, bought a fresh uniform and has been testing out Josephine's muscle power with some new lunch containers.

The new additions to her backpack and are all part of a wave of changes families — and their wallets — are being confronted with as they prepare for back to school, whether it's sourcing protective equipment or choosing a thermos their child can open unassisted.

""In a COVID-era, all of these things we take for granted or think are minuscule are actually really important,"" said Sweetland, who is his sister's guardian.

""These are things as simple as a teacher helping you unpack your lunch or zipping a zipper. To prevent potential spread, I don't think teachers are really going to be doing these things.""

The cost of so many new supplies can easily add up.

A Deloitte survey of 1,200 parents who have at least one child attending school in grades K-12 this fall found the average family will spend $102 on school supplies, $216 on clothing and accessories, $395 on computers and hardware, $316 on electronic gadgets and digital subscriptions.

The survey, which was conducted between May and July, found those families will allocate $61 on a new category: home or health supplies.

Even so, back-to-school shopping doesn't have to be more expensive than any other year, said Seung Hwan (Mark) Lee, an associate professor of retail management at Ryerson University.

He recommends shoppers compare prices and take advantage of sales.

Anne Marie Taber said she's noticed plenty of sales, though she hasn't sought them out when shopping with seven-year-old daughter Avery because she tries to minimize her time in stores and instead use online options with delivery to lessen her exposure to the virus.

She stocked up as soon as she could on Old Navy's uniform-style clothing because several sizes were out of stock and also grabbed Avery a new backpack.

On top of masks and hand sanitizers, they bought a wide-mouth water bottle without a straw to make cleaning easy, plastic Duo-Tangs that can be wiped down and a set of art supplies that Avery has been reminded not to share.

""This is extra stuff we haven't had to buy in the past but it's a small dollar to pay to make sure that that is just hers exclusively,"" Taber said.

Parents may also want to consider disposable cutlery, if they have children that bring lunches to school and are worried about germs spreading through anything reuseable, Lee said.

If your child is doing virtual classes, he suggests ensuring you have a reliable laptop or tablet with a webcam.

Those who want to go all out or are older and have specific needs for programs they are enrolled in, may need to think about microphones and speakers too.

Those supplies don't come cheap. However, the cost of those high-ticket items could be partially offset by a change he sees happening across universities and colleges during the pandemic.

""It's no longer really about carrying around the heavy textbooks,"" he said.

""Many professors aren't holding lengthy exams because the exams are becoming very difficult to monitor and you can't really get a proctor to look at how students are conducting their exams... so using test banks or textbooks no longer apply.""

Each summer, the former U.S. president unveils a selection of his favourite songs of the season.

Most of the artists are household names, but Obama often leaves room to showcase a few lesser-known acts, much to their surprise.

Shauf says he learned about his placement when a listener tagged him on Instagram shortly after Obama revealed the playlist on social media.

""It's cool to think that Obama, or the Obamas together, have listened to my music,"" he said.

""It's a really nice feeling to think my music has gone that far.""

""Neon Skyline"" is a particularly Canadian song choice because its story unravels inside the Skyline Restaurant, a real-life diner in Toronto's Parkdale neighbourhood, where two friends agree to meet for a beer shortly before one runs into his ex.

Shauf, who was born in Regina, said he frequented the Skyline when he moved to Toronto several years back

""It became a really friendly place to hang out and the setting for my record,"" he said.

Shauf has been a critical favourite in Canada for years. He was nominated for multiple Juno Awards, and ""The Neon Skyline"" landed on the long list of Polaris Prize contenders for this year's best album.

Fellow Canadian artists Drake and PartyNextDoor also showed up on Obama's list.

Both of them shared billing on Popcaan's track ""Twist & Turn,"" while Drake was also featured for his part on Rihanna's megahit ""Work.""

PartyNextDoor, who is Mississauga, Ont.-raised rapper Jahron Brathwaite, made a second appearance for his solo effort ""PGT,"" taken from his 2020 album, ""Partymobile.""

Michelaine Lahaie, chair of the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for RCMP, says a video shows an RCMP officer opening the door of a moving police vehicle, which hits the man.

The officer and other Mounties then use force to arrest him while he's on the ground.

Lahaie says the man was then injured in an alleged assault by another detained man in a cell at the Kinngait RCMP detachment and had to be flown to Iqaluit for medical treatment.

She says the investigation is to determine whether the conduct of the Mounties, including use of force, was reasonable.

She says in a news release that the probe will be a Public Interest Investigation into the conduct of RCMP in Kinngait.

""The RCMP members' conduct will be assessed in accordance with relevant law and RCMP policy,"" reads the terms of reference of the investigation released Tuesday.

""Consideration will also be given as to whether racial bias and/or discrimination played a role in the man's arrest and subsequent treatment.""

Lahaie noted the review she has requested by the commission is separate from an investigation by the Ottawa Police Service at the request of the Mounties and an RCMP internal Code of Conduct review.

""I am concerned with the conduct of RCMP members involved in this serious incident and will monitor both the OPS (Ottawa police) investigation and the RCMP's Code of Conduct investigation,"" Lahaie said in a release.

""The CRCC's investigation will provide an added level of scrutiny to the incident, as it will additionally examine the circumstances that led to the man being placed in a cell at the RCMP detachment where another detainee assaulted him and he needed to be airlifted to Iqaluit for treatment.

""I am aware that there is historical distrust by Inuit toward the police and I am committed to increasing RCMP accountability.""

The day after the man's arrest Nunavut Justice Minister Jeannie Ehaloak said she was outraged.

""I have seen the video from Kinngait circulating on social media and am very concerned by the unnecessary force, the violence and the lack of respect I have seen,'' she said in a release at the time.

""Nunavummiut should not fear this kind of treatment and disregard for safety and basic rights.''

Ehaloak said she would formally request a review by the commission.

The gravitas of the moment was not lost on the former journalist and mother of three. After she spoke the English words of her oath of office, she paused to take a deep breath, before repeating the oath in French.

""It's about time,"" Freeland said later at a press conference on Parliament Hill.

She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.

Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.

But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.

""There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,"" said Turnbull. ""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.""

Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.

She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.

""We don't like their representative very much,"" he said of her in September 2018.

Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said ""Mama (does not equal) chopped liver."" On the back it said ""Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.""

When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.

And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.

""She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,"" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.

He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.

""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.

""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.

""I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,"" he said. ""And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.""

She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.

""What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,"" Kelly said on Twitter. ""This has been missing in the department for several years.""

MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.

While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.

Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.

Trudeau said Tuesday that she had been ""a key player in my government from day one.""

Word — The term comes through Middle English and Old French from a Latin root, prorogare, to prolong.

article continues below

Effect — Prorogation essentially ends a session of Parliament, allowing for a new beginning with a speech from the throne.

Legislation — At one time, prorogation killed all legislation before Parliament, but rule changes now provide that most bills can be revived in the new session at the same stage they were at when the previous session ended.

Committees — Committees, including special and legislative committees, cease to exist. Membership on committees, except the membership of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, is terminated and all chairs and vice-chairs no longer hold these positions.

Documents — No document may be tabled until the first day of a new session.

Quote — ""Prorogation of a session brings to an end all proceedings before Parliament. With certain exceptions, unfinished business 'dies' on the Order Paper and must be started anew in a subsequent session."" — House of Commons Procedure and Practice, Third Edition, 2017.

Length — Prorogation can be as short as a few hours, or as long as several months. During this period, the House of Commons and Senate are shut down but the government remains in power and MPs remain MPs.

Frequency — Most Parliaments are prorogued at least once and often there are several prorogations and sessions in the life of a Parliament.

Authority — Prorogation is ordered by the Governor General on the advice of the prime minister. It is not covered by statute. Rather it is a personal legal power of the Governor General and by convention the prime minister has the right to provide advice. And by convention it's actually the prime minister's decision.

Granted — Prorogation is routinely granted. In December 2008, then-governor general Michaelle Jean took a few hours before granting prorogation, but that was a thorny case because opposition parties were threatening to defeat the government and install a coalition government shortly after an election.

Ceremony — At one time, prorogation was done in a formal ceremony in the Senate chamber, but that hasn't been used in decades. A simple proclamation signed by the Governor General does the trick today.

Liberal promise — In their 2015 election platform, the Liberals said Stephen Harper's Conservatives ""used prorogation to avoid difficult political circumstances. We will not.""

Limits — Governments can't use prorogation to shut down Parliament indefinitely. That would violate the constitutional requirement that Parliament meet at least once every 12 months. And without Parliament to approve a budget and spending estimates, the government would run out of money.

The letter, addressed to the permitting office of the National Marine Fisheries Service, states that potential harassment by Navy activities could affect the entire population of southern resident killer whales.
The navy’s proposal also projects that training and testing activities would result in 51 potential incidents per year that disturb a southern resident killer whale’s behaviour, up from two per year previously.
“Increasing the navy’s testing and training activities at this time is counter to what the endangered southern resident orcas need to have a chance at recovery.
Everything we can do now to protect the southern resident orcas is critical,” they write.","An application by the United States Navy to renew authorization for training and testing activities in southern resident killer whale habitat has scientists and environmental groups worried about the effects on the endangered species.

Twenty-nine organizations have signed a letter expressing concern that the permission requested by the navy would amount to “high levels of harassment” of southern resident killers whales, of which there are only 72.

article continues below

Deborah Giles, a research scientist at the University of Washington’s Center for Conservation Biology, said testing and training activities have the potential to disrupt the whales’ foraging, breeding, socializing and resting habits.

“When you’re talking about a population that is desperate for food and nourishment, any sort of disruption in foraging is something to take seriously,” Giles said, adding the whales could be forced to travel out of their habitats for food, which is already scarce.

Giles works for the non-profit Wild Orca, which has signed the letter, along with environmental groups such as Friends of the San Juans, Save Our Wild Salmon and Orca Network.

The letter, addressed to the permitting office of the National Marine Fisheries Service, states that potential harassment by Navy activities could affect the entire population of southern resident killer whales.

“Given the small size of the endangered southern resident orca population today, and the fact that they travel in groups, harm to a single individual orca can easily mean a population-level effect,” the letter says.

The U.S. Navy has had authorization for decades to conduct testing and training in the waters of the Pacific Northwest, including in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound. The current permit, which authorizes activities such as testing and training with sonar, firing torpedoes and dropping bombs from aircraft, expires in November.

John Mosher, an environmental planner for the navy, said applications to renew authorization generally include changes from previous years because of updated equipment and new systems. The navy is looking at expanding some activities, including the use of sonar, which can temporarily deafen orcas.

The navy’s proposal also projects that training and testing activities would result in 51 potential incidents per year that disturb a southern resident killer whale’s behaviour, up from two per year previously.

Mosher said the increase is due in part to an increased use of sonar, as well as a change in the understanding of where the whales spend their time.

Giles and others who signed the letter are concerned that any increase in disturbance to the whales could have a significant impact on the species’ survival.

“Increasing the navy’s testing and training activities at this time is counter to what the endangered southern resident orcas need to have a chance at recovery. Without bold and immediate actions, the southern residents are likely to go extinct. Everything we can do now to protect the southern resident orcas is critical,” they write.

The U.S. Navy is still consulting with the National Marine Fisheries Service and revising its application to renew authorization, and will continue to look at how to mitigate the impacts of naval activities on southern resident killer whales, Mosher said.

“The Navy has had a large presence in the Northwest for decades. We do not have any history of adverse impacts on the marine environment. So our protective measures have been effective over time, and I think we’ve demonstrated that we can be good stewards,” Mosher said.

A final environmental impact assessment is expected in the fall.

After acquiring the property Bos immediately began fixing up the cabins in order to welcome her first guests this summer on July 4th.
One friend, who wanted to be a professional water skier, gave Bos her wooden slalom water ski, dating back to 1950.
According to his granddaughter, Cuzner came to Shawnigan Lake, by train, then rowed across the lake to this spot to build a home so his two sons could study at Shawnigan Lake School.
On its outdoor porch is a sheltered office with a display cabinet made from old water skis.","For more than a decade Netta Bos visited Shawnigan Lake and loved it so much she moved to the recreational cottage community 17 years ago from Ontario.

During those 30 years one thing has never changed for Bos. She has always dreamed of one day owning lakefront — specifically land on the west side of the lake that looks directly across the waters to Mt. Baldy. Her ideal property is located in front of her main residence, which is tucked away in the woods behind a country road lined with large cedars. Bos’ home, while close to the lake, doesn’t have lake access or an unobstructed waterfront view, while this preferred property has both.

article continues below

Besides its great outlook the property has two small cabins on it, which were built during the early days of Shawnigan Lake’s cottage history. They were owned by a Victoria lawyer, who bought them in 1957 and only used them in summer.

“I used to walk down in the winter months to this spot and wish I could buy this place,” says Bos, standing near a picnic table with a gorgeous view of the lake and an arbutus tree near the water’s edge.

Getting to realize her dream of owning her “piece of paradise” didn’t come easy for Bos, who had to do it on her own as a single woman. She was separated in January, 2017 and finances were tight.

But she was determined. When Bos heard the owners planned to sell the property she was able to secure a private mortgage in order to make the deal happen quickly before it hit the MLS.

While many others would have torn down the humble cabins to build something modern that didn’t happen with Bos. “Necessity is the mother of invention I couldn’t afford to tear them down and rebuild so the only option was to fix them up. And then it became a story of ignorance is bliss and hindsight is 20/20. I’m not sure that I would do it again but then again, seeing the result, I can’t imagine not,” she says.

Bos took possession of her beloved lakefront property, becoming its third owner, in November, 2019. Although she finally had her lakefront a new desire was born. Bos wanted to create a unique vacation rental, which helps the property pay for itself.

As Shawnigan Lake continues to gain popularity, with many of the old-time cottages torn down and replaced by new builds, there are few opportunities for vacationers to experience life at the lake in the “good old days”- albeit with modern-day amenities, like wifi and air conditioning.

After acquiring the property Bos immediately began fixing up the cabins in order to welcome her first guests this summer on July 4th. Help came from many friends who Bos calls her “Shawnigan Angels.”

“Because of COVID no one could get away on vacation. I think for some I was entertainment value. They would come around to see what I was up to and offer help. Some would bring me food to keep me going, offer to paint furniture, fix items, bring me give gifts,” she says.

One friend, who wanted to be a professional water skier, gave Bos her wooden slalom water ski, dating back to 1950. It’s now on display in the larger cabin.

Since Bos’ background is in marketing, she put her skills to good use and created a vision for the cabins starting with the name, “Vintage Cabins, where life is, still.”

“Vintage Cabins also indicates that it is a place with history, not a 5-star accommodation but a place where you take your shoes off, a ‘muck-about’ space where you come in off the lake dripping wet and run into the cabin to grab a snack with the screen door banging behind you. The screen door was rebuilt and kept just for this reason,” she says.

Bos also drew on the history of the first home owners, calling the larger cabin, at 750 sq. ft., The Tailor’s Cabin since it was built by tailor William Cuzner in 1912. Her logo is a needle and thread in honor of the tailor.

According to his granddaughter, Cuzner came to Shawnigan Lake, by train, then rowed across the lake to this spot to build a home so his two sons could study at Shawnigan Lake School. He logged some of the trees on the property, to build the cabin then ran his business out of a small nook in one of the corners.

That nook was repurposed by Bos as a small games space, with a card table, vintage children’s book and toys, and in another nod to Cuzner, an old sewing box and wooden measuring stick. These are just a few of the curated vintage items in the cabin, adding to the cabin’s relaxed ambience.

The story goes Cuzner also wanted his two sons to learn construction so he taught them how to build the smaller of the two cabins in 1945. That cabin, called The Birdhouse, is appropriately decorated with vintage birdhouses and carved wooden birds. On its outdoor porch is a sheltered office with a display cabinet made from old water skis.

The decor of both cabins shows Bos’ keen eye and smart design choices.

“It’s easy to junk up a space so I’m trying hard not to have too much stuff,” she says.

Many of the pieces she has brought in are not only beautiful in their form but serve a function. For instance, Bos took an old suitcase and repurposed it as a side table, used a vintage, wooden shoe form as a doorstop and turned an old hat mould into a unique mirror.

But before she could have fun decorating the hard work needed to happen to get the cabins in good working order, since they were in rough shape after years of deferred maintenance.

“I had to gut the kitchen [of the Tailor’s Cabin]. When the ceiling was ripped out it snowed insulation and rat fees. The rafters were chewed from carpenter ants so it had to be all cleared out. I let it air out literally for a couple of months,” she says.

The kitchen now is full of country charm with bead board, vintage red cabinets and a gleaming white sink, from a kindergarten classroom and cleaned up. She was also able to reuse the appliances after giving them a good clean.

Another big task was ensuring the cabins were structurally sound. In the case of the Tailor’s Cabin one of its main corner posts rests on an old log stump. The cabin still stands on the stump, but its structural support has been reinforced. A happy result of shoring up the house was one of the original windows that didn’t open for decades now functions properly.

That cabin still has the original bottle glass, dating back to the early 1900s, so the lakeside windows here provide a charming “looking glass” view of the lake and Mt. Baldy beyond.

Other necessary property work that had to be done included a new septic field, new driveway, upgrading the plumbing and electrical and doing the landscaping, which meant removing decades of Salal, and rotten trees found on the property.

Then there was the business of building new decks to take advantage of the view, and bringing in two docks -one private for guests and the other Bos shares with them so she can continue to get out on the lake and enjoy water skiing.

“This has been my passion project. I just feel so blessed now that it’s done,” she says.

Or is it? Bos is considering converting an old shed on the property into either a sleeping cabana or a place of stillness.

It’s more of a gleeful taunt: MAPLE LEAFS POUTINE NOW HALF PRICE.

What, pray tell, is Maple Leafs poutine? The pub’s menu describes it thusly: “In usual Leafs fashion, a cold overpriced dish served with underperforming gravy, ice-cold fries and side of disappointment.”

article continues below

The usual price for this gastronomic disaster is $67, a nod to 1967, the last year the Toronto Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup.

But because managing partner Ken Whitaker is feeling good these days — his Montreal Canadiens remain in the playoffs while the Leafs have been chased to the golf course, just as God, or at least Guy Lafleur, intended — you can order this appropriately overpriced mess for half the usual cost.

Not that the pub will actually sell it to you. Server Marina McLean takes pity on those who ask for the dish.

“I always refuse them,” she says. “I tell them ‘You really don’t want it.’ ”

Likewise, when her father defiantly dons his Toronto gear and plants himself under the No Leafs Fans sign mounted on the pub’s wall, she refuses to stick him with the two-per-cent surcharge that normally gets added to the bill of anyone sporting a Leafs sweater or hat.

For real, they do that at the 17 Mile, at least if the patron looks like a good sport. Some customers show up dressed that way just to see the surcharge printed on their bill, which they wave like a medal, something to proudly photograph and text to fellow Leafs supporters.

Yes, hockey fans, it might be August, but in this strangest of years that just means another opportunity to continue the pub’s history of cheerfully bashing the Toronto Maple Leafs.

It began when Montreal-raised Whitaker bought into the business in 2005. The No Leafs sign went up soon after. Then came the surcharge and the poutine, the latter jointly created by Whitaker and chef/Canucks fan Paul Snoljanovic. At one point they even resorted to using urinal pucks bearing the Leafs crest, though some Toronto fans felt that was hitting below the belt. There are limits.

In recent years, Sooke Road commuters have been treated to an assortment of messages on that back-lit sign outside the pub.

“Free beer during all Leafs games during the playoffs,” it promised after Toronto failed to make the post-season.

“Leafs make the playoffs/Watch out for flying pigs” it advised after a more successful campaign.

But then came “Leafs miss playoffs/universe is back to normal.”

It’s all in a spirit of fun, Whitaker says. “We have lots of Leafs fans and lots of non-Leafs fans.” Most of the former take the teasing in the spirit in which it is intended, though one man scrawled an unprintable message in angry red letters on a paper napkin before flashing his middle finger as he peeled out of the parking lot.

Sports fans (OK, I) do tend to get wrapped up in their loyalties beyond reason. As a boy, I gazed in slack-jawed wonder as a man scaled the glass at a junior hockey game and hurled his spectacles at the referee, shouting, “You need these more than I do,” which made me see him in a different light when he delivered his sermon from the pulpit the next Sunday. (True story.)

Occasionally, a fight breaks out in the stands. Occasionally, Vancouver is set on fire. If the Canucks end up losing to St. Louis this week you will see people who have stayed solid as the Rock of Gibraltar throughout the pandemic suddenly crumble like Trump at a spelling bee.

The over-reactions can be on a broad scale. Every once in awhile a bout of belly-bumping bellicosity breaks out after ESPN catches a handful of drunken Canadian fans booing The Star Spangled Banner, which results in Americans chanting “U.S.A! U.S.A!” to drown out our anthem at the next game, to which we respond by singing it REALLY LOUDLY, even dragging out our sketchy knowledge of the French lyrics (“O Canada, terre de nos aieux, Sidney Crosby, deux minutes pour tripping”) to show how worldly we are.

That’s relatively harmless, but team tribalism can get seriously ugly when festering historical resentments, if not outright xenophobia, are stirred in (or up).

In 1969, cross-border grievances fuelled the fire when Honduras and El Salvador dropped the gloves (sorry, hockey analogy) in the so-called Football War within days of their World Cup qualifier. In some places, innocently wearing the wrong jersey into the wrong bar can get you killed.

Which is what makes the 17 Mile House’s Leaf-bashing a refreshing contrast. Only in a country in which differences are tolerated, even encouraged, could it be safe to celebrate a rivalry without it turning into a riot.

The company’s owner, Larry Teague, has known Tom Lindberg for about 50 years, as the two were in the Canadian Armed Forces together.
Teague is Paula Lindberg’s godfather and Tom Lindberg is godfather to both of Teague’s children, she said.
The Arctic Fox II, a wooden troller built in Scotland in 1947, underwent a full inspection a few weeks before it set sail, Paula Lindberg said.","The daughter of the veteran Cobble Hill fisherman who died when the Arctic Fox II capsized in the waters off Washington state said her father put the deckhands’ lives ahead of his own as heavy waves crashed onto the boat in the pitch black night.

Tom Lindberg, the 76-year-old skipper of the vessel, and another fisherman died Aug. 11 after the boat capsized about 136 kilometres offshore of Cape Flattery, which is just south of Port Renfrew. The third fisherman was found alive in a life boat by U.S. Coast Guard officers responding to the vessel’s distress call. The name of the sole survivor and the other man who died have not been released.

“I know my dad just did everything he could for that young man,” said Paula Lindberg, breaking down into tears. “He would 100 per cent put that young man’s life in front of his own. It sounded like a chaotic, devastating, fast night.”

Paula Lindberg was told there was only 20 minutes between when the mayday call was put out around 2 a.m. and when the boat went down which is “incredibly fast.”

Paula Lindberg said she hasn’t spoken directly with the family of the sole survivor but she’s heard some of the details of what happened from the company that owns the vessel, Teague Fishing Corporation. The company’s owner, Larry Teague, has known Tom Lindberg for about 50 years, as the two were in the Canadian Armed Forces together. Teague is Paula Lindberg’s godfather and Tom Lindberg is godfather to both of Teague’s children, she said.

“They trusted each other implicitly. Larry would never put my dad in harm’s way and he would not put his business in harm’s way,” said Paula Lindberg, addressing the allegations by Raymond Dixon and his twin brother Anthony, who say they were recruited as deckhands but left the ship in Victoria because they had safety concerns.

The Arctic Fox II, a wooden troller built in Scotland in 1947, underwent a full inspection a few weeks before it set sail, Paula Lindberg said. The boat left from Cowichan Bay on Aug. 2. “You can’t insure an unsafe boat,” she said.

Dixon recalled that Teague told him and his brother that they had to keep an eye out for boats because the skipper was blind but Paula Lindberg said while her father wore reading glasses, his eyesight was fine. She thinks they mis-heard and that Teague was warning them about watching the boat’s blind spots while the skipper was at the helm.

She disputed Dixon’s characterization of rotting beams in the galley, saying the entire wheelhouse was re-built in 2016. Dixon said the boat stopped in Victoria because a hydraulic pump had burst but Paula Lindberg said it was a freezer pump that wouldn’t affect the structural integrity of the boat.

Paula Lindberg said the twin brothers had never been on a commercial fishing expedition before so they wouldn’t know what to expect on the boat. For example, Dixon thought waxing the zippers of the survival suits meant they were old but Paula Lindberg said that’s a routine task before going out to sea.

“He was trying to teach them,” she said. “He could be a tough captain because he wanted to be safe, he wanted to keep everyone alive.”

The B.C. Coroners Service, the Transportation Safety Board and WorkSafe B.C. are all investigating the capsizing.

In October 2006, Lindberg and another crew member survived after their boat, the Silver Bear, capsized 220 kilometres west of Cape Disappointment, Washington. The two were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard after spending two hours floating in a life raft in five-metre swells.

In that incident, the deckhand credited the skipper with saving his life.

“I know the deckhand at the time, praised my father for saving his life and just being so prepared,” she said. Tom Lindberg praised the U.S. Coast Guard for their amazing response.

“He was a tough cookie. He didn’t have a lot of fear around the ocean,” she said.

His daughter and his wife of 45 years, Angela, wondered when the life-long mariner would retire from the dangerous and unpredictable job. Paula Lindberg said her dad retired for one year but he was miserable. He’d go down to the Cowichan Bay wharf and watch his friends head out to sea.

“He was still mobile and active and sharp,” she said.

Tom Lindberg was born in Sweden and moved to Canada with his family at age seven. He spent seven years in the Canadian Armed Forces working as an engineer which included a deployment in Germany in the late 1960s. He worked as a commercial deep sea diver and in the 1970s, started his career as a commercial fisherman. In 1993, the family moved from the Lower Mainland to Cobble Hill and Tom Lindberg started fishing out of Cowichan Bay.

As a child, Paula Lindberg said her dad taught her to fish. He would take her out sometimes for 10 days at a time and give her small tasks such as throwing back the dogfish. She said her father instilled in her a love of the arts and would take her to the ballet and the theatre. Paula Lindberg now works in Los Angeles as an actor but she returned to Cobble Hill in May when her sister was sick with breast cancer. Her sister and Tom Lindberg’s stepdaughter, died last week so the family is struggling with a double loss.

Paula Lindberg said being a mariner isn’t always something you can learn, but comes with having an innate sense of the ocean which her father always had. “He would talk about the struggle of man versus nature and he’s really passionate about it,” she said. “He was one of those men who just got it.”

Tom Lindberg was previously the president of the B.C. Tuna Fishermen’s Association and a longtime board member with the Cowichan Bay Fishermen’s Wharf.

“He was a passionate seaman,” his daughter said. “He loved being on the ocean, he loved his community of fishermen. He dedicated his life to it.”

McMurter got into program in which street kids got restaurant training while working at a cafe.","Somewhere between the two extremes — those who want to hug all the messed-up people on the street, and those who would happily hose them into the Inner Harbour — stands Sue McMurter.

On one hand, she is solidly for law and order. She has little patience for the ivory tower lefties on city council, the ones whose view of street life is filtered by ideology, the cop-bashers who don’t understand what the police really do. She is tired of the discarded needles in her Burnside-Gorge neighbourhood, of the stranger’s hand rattling her door at 4 a.m.

article continues below

On the other, she calls the conversion of area hotels into temporary housing “a good start.” And long before the province announced $36 million for youth treatment centres this week, McMurter was passionately arguing the urgent need for such facilities, particularly here on Vancouver Island, where none exist. She has nothing but sympathy for people like the young woman she found living in a tent the other day, unaware of the help available to her.

For McMurter, 45, has a rare perspective: Three decades ago, she was a street-entrenched runaway. And she knows that if you want to paint a picture of an individual, you can’t use a broad brush.

Her story goes back to 1989, when the then 14-year-old found herself on Vancouver’s Granville Street after fleeing traumatizing violence. She survived by couch-surfing, panhandling, living in squats with other broken, bullied teens. The streets were full of such kids, gravitating to their own sub-cultures: criminals, punks, goths, racist skinheads, non-racist skinheads….

Knowing that she needed an education, she bounced around a series of schools, where no one paid attention to the honour roll student who would be there for awhile, then be gone.

At 15 she asked about getting government help, but because her family home was in the Fraser Valley she was sent to a welfare office in Aldergrove, where a social worker basically told her to stop whining and go away. Great. Already feeling like she didn’t matter, she had it confirmed by officialdom. “The world’s telling me I’m a complete piece of shit.”

So she stayed on the streets where, because she wasn’t crossing paths with the police or creating problems in school, she was effectively invisible. No one saw that she was anxious and depressed. No one paid attention to the drinking and the drugs.

She avoided some of the traps, though. “Pimps are looking at me and I’m, like, ‘I know what you’re after. Go away.’” She scrambled for jobs where she could find them, even working at a high-end south Granville salon until customers complained she was too young.

It wasn’t until she was 16 and starving that a friend dragged her to the provincial government’s adolescent services unit in search of meal vouchers to a local restaurant. “Where have you been all this time?” asked the man in charge. “I came in here before and you guys sent me away,” she replied.

After that, McMurter was taken into government care, which first meant a room in an infamous flophouse, then — thankfully — a spot in a group home for girls run by a wonderful woman named Lenox who provided structure and, more importantly, caring. McMurter went to alternative school, where she thrived. “I didn’t have the obstacles the other kids had.”

In fact she did so well that she outgrew the group home — which proved to be her downfall. Deemed strong and competent enough to live unsupported, she moved out on her own at age 18. Without the structure provided by Lenox, it was a disaster. She found herself surrounded by addicts. It was 1993, the year the China White heroin wave broke over Vancouver. “B.C. Ambulance personnel were having nervous breakdowns. They were hauling bodies out of dumpsters.” It wasn’t only the street addicts who were dying. There were high school kids, business guys in Armani suits.

“It was not just the Downtown Eastside. The ugliness was absolutely everywhere, and there was a gang turf war exploding.”

Then, far away in Ontario, her grandmother died. “That was a massive hit to me, losing her. My grandma was the one person in the world who loved me, and she was gone.” McMurter was closing in on her 19th birthday, which in those days meant aging out of government care, falling off a cliff. She was scared.

“My whole peer group was going downhill with all the heroin that’s around,” she said. She found herself alone in an East Van slum, no job, no school, nothing. “I felt completely abandoned by the people who were supposed to be taking care of me.”

Back then, when youth in care turned 19 they would get shuttled down the street to the adult welfare office, assigned to a formidable woman who would admonish them to get a job. Blunt advice, but the alternative was the treadmill in which the ambulance sirens began as soon as the welfare cheques were cashed.

McMurter got into program in which street kids got restaurant training while working at a cafe. That went well until her anxiety caught up to her and, instead of helping her work through it, her government-funded employer dumped her. What made things worse was that the job had made her ineligible for social assistance, so, unable to pay her rent, she found herself on the street again. “Thanks, guys.”

She drifted to Denman Island where, while working in a restaurant and living in a tent, she turned 20. Then came a similar job in Invermere, then other towns. She was still self-medicating, but the more she distanced herself from her old life in Vancouver, the more she met new kinds of people, saw more possibilities.

She was 23 and living in Calgary when she got clean.

What was the catalyst? “Just knowing that that there’s more to the world, and being smart enough to know I didn’t want to die in a gutter…. Knowing I was capable of being more than that.”

She focussed on gaining the life she wanted, not quitting the one she wanted to leave. It worked. “I’m someone who came out the other side.”

So now she is married and has a government job — and the perspective that comes with lived experience. The latter allows her to eschew that broad brush being applied to both campers and the used-to-be homeless now living in temporary housing. The actions of some shouldn’t leave them all branded as criminals. Nor are they all little lost lambs.

“The little lost lamb talk has to go away,” she says. Social justice warriors can’t excuse anti-social behaviour. “You can be compassionate and have boundaries at the same time. You can take care of people without letting them burn down your house.”

But you do need to take care of people, which means that it’s not good enough to offer harm-reduction strategies that aren’t accompanied by treatment. “Sure it gives them clean supplies, but where’s the incentive to stop?” So, yes, those youth-treatment beds are desperately needed. So are treatment beds in general. People in need matter, even when made to feel that they don’t.

About 353,000 square feet of buildings are envisioned, Peter Laughlin, Omicron’s director of development on Vancouver Island, said Thursday.

The proposal covers four development parcels. Omicron and Lotus will own two and Omicron will be the development manager of the other two.

Applications have been submitted for employment centre zoning on two of the parcels to attract businesses, add services and provide local jobs, which would help address local transportation issues, Laughlin said. The West Shore is known for its slow traffic during rush hours.

“One of the things that we were looking at, and we knew from past experience - there was a need for industrial lands. The Island is growing. We have an extremely solid economy here. The economy needs support. So we were looking for industrial land for quite a while,” Laughlin said.

The Allandale District is located on both sides of Veterans Memorial Parkway and along Allandale Road.

Colwood Mayor Rob Martin said the community has called for more commercial and light industrialdevelopment.

These kinds of uses will broaden the tax base, he said, adding that, as a bedroom community, Colwood has been relying on residential taxpayers to cover most of the municipality’s bills.

To have tax revenue from commercial uses is “huge for us,” Martin said.

Colwood is passionate about adding well-paying new jobs, held by people who live in the community, Martin said.

“In a very small way, it begins to address the issues around transportation as well. One of our solutions to this is that we need to begin to create more jobs here in the West Shore.”

He welcomes projects which will redevelop existing brownfield sites in Colwood, as in this case.

Half of the development lands are on an old gravel pit and the remainder on a rock bluff, Laughlin said.

Rocks were blasted out of the bluff to create flat areas for development. More than 200,000 cubic metres of blasted rock was relocated to become infill on the former gravel pit, making the entire area usable, Laughlin said. “Land that was seven-eight-nine metres below the road level is now at road level and usable. So it’s a good example of brownfield development.”

Ridley Bros. has been the owner of the four parcels, Laughlin said.

Rezoning applications for two lots, one immediately to the west of the Parkway (Lot B) and another to the east (Lot C) and north of Allandale Road, have been submitted to pave the way for mixed-use employment centres. The applications are expected to come up on the city’s Aug. 24 agenda.

Omicron and Lotus Capital will own the southern and most westerly lot, Lot A, as well as Lot C, north of Allandale and east of the Parkway.

Lot A already allows a range of industrial uses. Colliers International is carrying out market research on what would be the best use for Lot C.

Lot B, immediately to the west of the Parkway, will be owned by local company Sherringham Holdings Ltd.

“The plan right now is for approximately 100,000 square feet of development on that site,” Laughlin said. Of that, about 60,000 square feet will be built as mini-storage, with 40,000 used for commercial-retail.

“The interesting innovation that Sherringham is bringing to the mini-storage market is it is a multi-floor mini-storage,” Laughlin said.

Plans call for a four-storey building, serviced by industrial elevators.

The fourth parcel, Lot 3, east of the parkway and south of Allandale, will be developed on behalf of the Carson Auto Group for a new Ford dealership, Laughlin said.

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

article continues below

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

The five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations are upset that Ottawa decided to give a surplus allocation of salmon — which arose this year due to reduced recreational fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic — to commercial fishers rather than to the First Nations.

Clifford Atleo, lead negotiator for one of the nations who is also called Wickaninnish, says he feels sports and commercial troll fishers are given more rights to fish in the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

He says the latest decision to shut First Nations fishers out of an opportunity to catch more chinook salmon this year shows systemic racism is ""alive and well"" within the federal fisheries department.

""We feel very strongly we're not being dealt with fairly, we know we're not being dealt with fairly,"" Atleo said.

""It's just another layer of disappointment on the part of how the government deals with us. The government doesn't realize that their attitude toward our people is dyed-in-the-wool ... And I think the government — sometimes they don't realize they're being racist. They've got age-old policies that have never changed.""

A 2018 B.C. Supreme Court ruling directed Ottawa to take a more ""generous approach"" to allocations of chinook salmon to the First Nations given the importance of this species to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people.

The ruling from B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Humphries noted that the government's salmon allocation policy at the time gave recreational fisherman priority to fish for chinook and soho salmon ahead of the First Nations and advised the fisheries minister to reassess this policy.

Despite this ruling and changes that have since placed the First Nations at a higher priority than sport fishers, the Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ehattesaht and Mowachaht/Muchalaht nations say their yearly fishing allocations have not increased.

This year, the five First Nations were told they could fish 7,724 chinook, which amounts to just 1.5 fish per person for the 5,000 members of their communities.

COVID-19 brought a new dynamic to the salmon allocations this year, as fewer sport fishers were able to come due to pandemic restrictions. This means the recreational fleet is expected to catch 15,000 less salmon than was forecasted for this year, according to figures provided by the department.

None of this surplus is going to the First Nations.

""As per approved management plans, the Area G (commercial) harvest is adjusted based on the projected recreational harvests which results in an increase of 15,000 for 2020,"" said department spokesperson Athina Vazeos.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan was unavailable for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Jennifer Kuss, noted the improvements made in giving the five nations a higher priority in the yearly salmon catch allocations, as directed by the courts.

""This change ensures that food, social, and ceremonial (fishing) continues to be prioritized first, and additionally prioritizes the Five Nations rights-based sale fishery over the recreational and commercial fishery,"" Kuss said in a statement.

The Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations argue Ottawa could have provided some of the unused catch from this year to their people to help them support their remote communities. But Atleo said fisheries officials would not even engage in discussions about it.

""The government is trying to say they consult with us, they negotiate with us. They create their fishing plans, put it on the table and it's like take or leave it,"" Atleo said.

""All we want to do is be part of the economy, part of looking after ourselves without depending on government. We don't think that's a lot to ask.""

NDP MP Gord Johns, whose riding takes in the West Coast fishing shores, said he finds it ""disgusting"" the Trudeau government has repeatedly highlighted its desire to restore the Crown's relationship with Indigenous Peoples but has still fought many legal battles with these nations over their fishing rights.

""Indigenous people in our communities rely on this fishery for their economy, for their food security, for their culture. It's part of their way of life. These are salt water people and they rely on the salmon and to be denied their right is shameful, it's disgusting that the government is taking this approach.""

The First Nations are calling on Ottawa to revisit its decision on the surplus salmon for this year to allow them a portion of the additional catch.

""The government has an opportunity to fix this with these (surplus salmon) to come with a fair opportunity to exercise their commitment, in the judge's words, for a generous allocation to the nations and to start moving forward with reconciliation,"" Johns said.

The minister's spokeswoman says Jordan takes any allegations of systemic racism ""very seriously"" and that Ottawa is working with the five nations on a reconciliation agreement on fisheries resources, which is intended to broaden their access in the area, Kuss said.

""The road to reconciliation is a long journey, and Canada is committed to moving forward together. The department has spoken with the five nations on the reallocation of (salmon catch) on multiple occasions and that open dialogue will continue.""

The BC Wildfire Service said crews are responding to the fire on Christie Mountain about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, on the east side of Skaha Lake.

The fire is estimated at 250 hectares and firefighters on the ground are being supported by air tankers.

The service said the situation was ""rapidly evolving"" and asked everyone to stay clear of the area to avoid interfering with the operation.

The order asks residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with pets and critical items.

""We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,"" the service said in a tweet.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a ""fire of note"" on Tuesday.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was smouldering with no open flame but was considered out of control. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight.

Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Firefighters have tackled dozens of wildfires after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions.

Two fires were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.

However, 66 players have currently opted out of participating in the 2020 campaign, which could create opportunity for some CFL players to sign deals south of the border and have a chance to earn a football paycheque, either on the active roster or on the practice squad.

While there's no shortage of collegiate players available, the advantage a CFL player has is pro experience, a fact not lost upon NFL personnel people.

The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign. This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.

And players on NFL practice rosters receive at least US$8,000 per week.

Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the CFL is amendable to doing what it can to help its players.

""Where we can do something we will,"" he said. ""We're going to be committed to working towards good outcomes, the best possible outcomes we can have with out players.

""That's not going to mean we're going to be able to do everything but we're certainly going to go into this with a real positive spirit.""

Something else that will be on the CFL-CFLPA radar will be the current collective bargaining agreement, which is slated to expire after the 2021 season. But union president Solomon Elimimian said the two sides covered a lot of ground this time around during talks to amend the agreement for a shortened '20 season.

""Whether we deal with '21 when it comes or after the '21 season I think there's hope there that we can work together,"" Elimimian said. ""Obviously the relationship between the players and the league needs to be one where the players feel appreciated.

""Everyone wants to the league to reach its full potential. The partnership has to be one that's very genuine and the players have to feel part of that. If that happens, the sky is the limit.""

In documents filed by her court-appointed lawyer that give a rare public airing to the wishes of the 38-year-old pop superstar, she asked that her father not return to the role of conservator of her person, which gave him power over her major life decisions from 2008 until 2019, when he temporarily stepped aside, citing health problems.

article continues below

""Britney is strongly opposed to James return as conservator of her person,"" the document says.

James Spears has kept his separate role as conservator over his daughter's finances. For the first 11 years of the conservatorship, he served as co-conservator with attorney Andrew M. Wallet, who resigned from the role early last year.

That briefly left James Spears with sole power over Britney Spears' life, money and career, a situation she says she very much wants to avoid repeating.

An email seeking comment from James Spears' attorney was not immediately returned.

Spears says she wants Jodi Montgomery, who has been serving as conservator of her person temporarily, to do so permanently, but she says that doesn't mean she is waiving her right to seek an end to the entire arrangement.

The documents also reveal that Britney Spears has no plans to perform again anytime soon. She last performed live in October 2018, and early in 2019, cancelled a planned Las Vegas residency.

The filing gave a rare glimpse at Britney Spears' own wishes in the conservatorship that has had vast power over her for over a decade. She has almost never spoken publicly about the matter, and court hearings and documents in the case are cloaked in secrecy, though last year she addressed the court at her request, suggesting she was seeking changes.

In the papers, Britney Spears praises the conservatorship and its work overall, saying it ""rescued her from a collapse, exploitation by predatory individuals and financial ruin"" and that it made her ""able to regain her position as a world class entertainer.""

The document was filed a day before a status hearing on the conservatorship, expected to be closed to the media and public.

Britney Spears' attorney said that he expects James Spears will aggressively contest being marginalized, and said that Britney Spears has suggested they retain a lawyer with expertise in complex financial court fights.

The conservatorship, known in some states as a guardianship, gave James Spears power over his daughter's career choices and much of her personal life, including her relationship with her teenage sons. Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline has custody of the boys, but she has frequent visits with them.

When you are The Killers and your usual guitarist has gone, no problem. When you’re The Killers you can turn to Lindsey Buckingham.

article continues below

The former Fleetwood Mac guitarist steps in for a tune on the new 10-song ""Imploding the Mirage,"" another sign of the band’s clout. The album's guests also include k.d. lang and Adam Granduciel of The War on Drugs.

The absence of guitarist and co-founder Dave Keuning is felt, with keyboards and drums stepping into the void. Without Keuning’s jangle and riff shards, The Killers have a more poppy sound.

If 2017's ""Wonderful Wonderful"" was a meditation on the anxiety of masculinity, the new album often explores the lives of women, with two sharp portraits of tough survivors in ""Blowback"" and ""Caution"" — women whom Brandon Flowers sings each come from ""white trash.""

Many other songs are about loyally backing a partner. ""I’ll be there when water’s rising/I’ll be your lifeguard,"" Flowers sings on ""Dying Breed."" On ""When the Dreams Run Dry,"" he vows: ""I’ll be on your side/When the dreams run dry."" In ""Lightening Fields,"" he sings, ""Just wanted to run my fastest/And stand beside you."" The cover of the album depicts a god tenderly supporting a goddess.

Jonathan Rado of California psychedelic-rock duo Foxygen and Shawn Everett — who worked on ""Wonderful Wonderful"" as well as with Kacey Musgraves and Alabama Shakes — have stepped in to produce and their influence can best be heard on the funky ""Fire in Bone.""

Elsewhere, listeners may have fun finding the band's other influences. There's a Tom Petty-ish sound to ""Blowback"" and ""My Own Soul's Warning"" has a Springsteen vibe. But there's no mistaking that classic Killers mix of soaring vocals, sonic bombast and sly humour in such songs as ""My God"" and the title track. It's a solid album from a band still exploring.

""This is me. I am 'Pipe Nation,'"" she said with a laugh Monday during an interview with The Canadian Press in Sundre, Alta., a picturesque oil town nestled near the Rocky Mountains.

article continues below

""I've been working in the oil and gas industry for about six years. I took a break when the bust happened and did a little serving, a little bartending but always went back to the oil and gas,"" added Gamble, who is 24.

""My father, my grandfather and my great grandfather were all in the oil and gas industry as well.""

Sundre is set to become the fictional community of Hardwell. The drama will focus on day-to-day hardships labourers face, with Gamble's character as the leader of a pipe gang — workers who position and align the pipe, preparing it for the weld. In real life, Gamble has held a number of jobs in the industry including welding.

But this is her first acting part since middle school.

""I always wanted to become an actor because I always thought pretending to be someone and falling into a character is a lot of fun and being someone else,"" she said.

""Unfortunately that's not the direction I went to until now when I got handed this beautiful opportunity that my little-girl dream could come true.""

Filmmaker and director Raoul Bhatt says he wanted a mix of both professional and amateur actors on set, and he's not concerned about the lack of experience from some of his cast members. He sees it as an asset to the project.

""I needed this to be believable and I needed someone with a certain language, a certain grit, combined with people who have actor experience,"" said Bhatt, adding 480 people showed up for the casting call. ""I wanted someone who's believable, honest, sincere and lives in the moment.""

Bhatt, who grew up in Edmonton, has a soft spot for the energy sector and says the show is meant to spotlight the colourful nature of the individuals.

""They're just beautiful people and to showcase that beyond the Dow Jones, beyond just the oil and gas numbers to human struggle, conditions and overcoming adversity and the determination of these characters is what the show is about,"" he said.

Bhatt, a software engineer who self-funded the pilot, has worked as a cinematographer and producer for the Daytime Emmys, as well as with Universal Studios' ""Jurassic World"" and a number of music videos.

He understands there are plenty of people out there who are not fans of the oil and gas industry.

""We are leaning toward pro but again that's for the viewer to decide. If you're against the oil and gas industry that's your opinion but I really hope this creates an emotional connection with the characters.""

Filming of the pilot will be completed by the end of August. Bhatt said he is in negotiations with a couple of streaming services for a 10-episode season.

A storage lot for oilfield equipment in Sundre is one of the regular sets. In addition, a portion of farmland in Sundre has been cleared for the actual building of a mini pipeline to add to the realism of the show.

Bhatt isn't short on technical advisers. Gin Ford, who plays the character Dee, has been a pipeline welder for the past 10-plus years. She has no acting experience but intends to use the show as a vessel for female empowerment and women in the energy industry.

""I'm not here for fame or recognition. I am actually here to make a voice for women in trades. Here's the moment for me to be a voice,"" said Ford.

""I've been called the pipeline princess and it's like, you can roll onto site and right way it's 'this girl's out here to work?'"" she said.

""I definitely want to highlight you can look like you want and you can still work in a male-dominated industry. It doesn't matter if you've got the nails, the lashes, the hair or the Barbie image.""

Ford said the show is meant to be raw, but it's not reality TV or a documentary.

""I'm not going to lie. My mom's probably going to tell me to wash my mouth out with some soap,"" Ford said, noting her character is tough-talking, confident and keeps up with the guys.

Mike Vickers plays Ryan, an East Coaster who moved to Alberta to make his fortune in the oil industry. Art imitates life for Vickers who moved to Alberta from Cape Breton.

""When I read the script it was my life. I fell in love with this. It's going to really showcase that true oil and gas grit, the struggles we all face and how we overcome it together as a family,"" Vickers said.

""There's so much opportunity to better the image of this industry and it's how we all come together is how we're going to do this and tell this story.""

Filming in Sundre is expected to wrap up by Aug. 24 and will finish in Nisku, south of Edmonton, by the end of the month.

""Just last night I fantasized I was in a time machine,"" he sings, which may explain songs about the Great Depression, Presidents Lincoln and Nixon, and the New York Dolls’ late guitar hero. There’s even a reference to a stereo. The effective thematic thread serves as an argument for albums as delivery systems even in 2020.

The subject matter pushes Prophet more toward pop. His wise-guy tenor hasn’t changed, and is the perfect match for lines like, ""You’re headed for prison, you know."" But retro horns and chiming guitars provide sunny support as Prophet remembers his father on ""Best Shirt On,"" and the ode to escape ""Waving Goodbye"" features one of several arresting melodies.

""It's cool to think that Obama, or the Obamas together, have listened to my music,"" he said.

""It's a really nice feeling to think my music has gone that far.""

""Neon Skyline"" is a particularly Canadian song choice because its story unravels inside the Skyline Restaurant, a real-life diner in Toronto's Parkdale neighbourhood, where two friends agree to meet for a beer shortly before one runs into his ex.

Shauf, who was born in Regina, said he frequented the Skyline when he moved to Toronto several years back

""It became a really friendly place to hang out and the setting for my record,"" he said.

Shauf has been a critical favourite in Canada for years. He was nominated for multiple Juno Awards, and ""The Neon Skyline"" landed on the long list of Polaris Prize contenders for this year's best album.

Fellow Canadian artists Drake and PartyNextDoor also showed up on Obama's list.

Both of them shared billing on Popcaan's track ""Twist & Turn,"" while Drake was also featured for his part on Rihanna's megahit ""Work.""

Andrew Cuomo, who has gained a national following through his management of the coronavirus pandemic, is writing a book that looks back on his experiences so far, and includes leadership advice and a close look at his relationship with the administration of President Donald Trump.

Crown announced Tuesday that Cuomo's ""American Crisis"" will be released Oct. 13, three weeks before Election Day, when Trump is expected to face presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The news comes the day after Cuomo addressed the Democratic National Convention and called the virus' spread a metaphor for a country weakened by division. New York State has one of the lowest infection rates in the U.S., a welcome contrast to the spring, when it had one of the highest.

The book is an unusual and risky case of reflecting on a crisis that is still ongoing, and could intensify in the fall.

""In his own voice, Andrew Cuomo chronicles in ‘American Crisis’ the ingenuity and sacrifice required of so many to fight the pandemic,"" according to Crown, ""sharing his personal reflections and the decision-making that shaped his policy, and offers his frank accounting and assessment of his interactions with the federal government and the White House, as well as other state and local political and health officials.""

Over the past few months, Cuomo has been praised for his calm but forceful demeanour, while also being accused of waiting too long to close schools and other indoor facilities, and criticized for the high number of deaths at New York nursing homes. He had said in July he was thinking of a book, commenting during a radio interview on WAMC that he wanted to document the ""entire experience, because if we don't learn from this then it will really compound the whole crisis that we've gone through.""

In an excerpt from ""American Crisis"" that Crown shared with The Associated Press, Cuomo emphasized the importance of confronting fear.

""The questions are what do you do with the fear and would you succumb to it,"" he wrote. ""I would not allow the fear to control me. The fear kept my adrenaline high and that was a positive. But I would not let the fear be a negative, and I would not spread it. Fear is a virus also.""

Financial terms for ""American Crisis"" were not disclosed. Cuomo was represented by Washington attorney Robert Barnett, whose other clients include former President Barack Obama and former President George W. Bush. Cuomo is also the author of ""All Things Possible: Setbacks and Success in Politics and Life,"" which came out in 2014.

Cuomo, currently serving his third term, became known to many for his blunt, straightforward press conferences, and for a time was even mentioned as a possible presidential candidate. His style has differed notably from the more erratic approach of President Trump, a Republican with whom he has clashed often. In his speech to the Democratic convention, Cuomo bemoaned the ""dysfunctional and incompetent"" federal response to the pandemic. Trump, meanwhile, has blamed Cuomo’s ""poor management"" for New York’s tens of thousands COVID-19 fatalities.

Cuomo has received some of his strongest criticism for the thousands of virus-related deaths at New York nursing homes. A recent AP investigation found that the state's death toll of nursing home patients, already among the highest in the nation, could be significantly more than reported. Unlike every other state with major outbreaks, only New York explicitly says that it counts just residents who died on nursing home property and not those who were transported to hospitals and died there.

So far, Cuomo's administration has declined to release the number. The governor has called criticism of nursing home deaths politically motivated."

Their caged homes don’t seem oppressive; a mangy stray dog named Bob (Danny DeVito) keeps Ivan company.
The real story of Ivan is more interesting even if it's probably too dispiriting and shameful for a Disney movie.

Directed by Thea Sharrock (""Me Before You"") and scripted with characteristic sensitivity by Mike White (""School of Rock,"" ""Enlightened""), the film initially seems like the expected stuff of snarky CGI animals. Ivan (Sam Rockwell) is a 400-pound silverback gorilla who lives in the corner of the Big Top Mall, a shopping centre with a struggling circus act on the side. (Given that multiplexes have long similarly abutted malls, ""The One and Only Ivan"" — which premieres Friday on Disney+ — could serve as an unwitting metaphor for a fading brick-and-mortar reality for movie theatres.)

Their owner is Mack (Bryan Cranston), an increasing desperate small-business owner — more carnival barker than zoologist — whose show isn’t drawing like it used to. Ivan is his star act; he finishes off each performance with a loud roar and some chest thumping. Mack decides he needs a new headliner and procures a cute baby elephant named Ruby (Brooklynn Prince), who’s parented by the circus’ veteran pachyderm, Stella (Angelina Jolie, also a producer).

""The One and Only Ivan"" seems at first fully invested in whether Mack can turn his show around. But it pivots to sink deeper into the interior lives of the animals in his care. Their caged homes don’t seem oppressive; a mangy stray dog named Bob (Danny DeVito) keeps Ivan company. But Sharrock bathes their restricting confines in claustrophobic shadow. The outside world feels far away. Taking up painting, Ivan colours a dreamed-up forest.

Mack is far from Joe Exotic but we start to question whether Big Top Mall is a good home for Ivan and the rest. The movie, like the book, is inspired by the real story of a gorilla named Ivan who was captured as a baby in the Congo, raised by a family in the U.S., and sat on display in a small concrete cell at a Tacoma, Washington, shopping mall for 27 years before an outcry (prompted in part by a National Geographic documentary ) won his release to a zoo.

The real story of Ivan is more interesting even if it's probably too dispiriting and shameful for a Disney movie. At the same time there’s some awkwardness in relating such an animal-rights tale with fart jokes and a celebrity voice ensemble (among the cast is Helen Mirren as the poodle Snickers and Chaka Khan as a chicken named Henrietta.)

But there’s an uncommon mournfulness to ""The One and Only Ivan"" that tugs at the question of where can these animals go? They plot an escape to the woods across the street only to find it's a small green patch surrounded by development. Give ""The One and Only Ivan"" credit for trying to bridge ""Dumbo"" with ""Blackfish.""

""The One and Only Ivan,"" a Walt Disney Co. release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America for mild thematic elements. Running time: 90 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.

It's a perfectly-timed appetizer for an evolving artist — a wistful and experimental musical postcard for an uneasy era. Many songs have an extended house break, as if Sivan was stepping away to dance furiously on his own.

Sivan reunites with producer Oscar Görres, who worked on some songs from ""Bloom,"" Sivan's last, marvelous full-length album in 2018, including the awesome track ""My My My!""

This time, Görres and Sivan stretch and play with song structure and length, a fun little present for Sivan fans and an indication that perhaps he's restless mining the same territory. Lyric-wise, he's lost a little of his swagger, more vulnerable.

""Easy"" has a '80s, ""Pretty in Pink"" vibe with echoing computer-altered vocals and spacy, thick slabs of synth. The less-than-a-minute ""could cry just thinkin about you"" has Sivan's vocals so distorted he sounds like he's singing deep in a swimming pool.

The clear standout is the dreamy ""Take Yourself Home,"" the only song finished during the pandemic. It is stunning, hypnotic and sexy. It even has an anti-urban feel. ""I’m tired of the city,"" he sing. ""If I’m gonna die, let’s die somewhere pretty.""

Sivan's voice gets drunken for ""STUD,"" a pleading song to a wannabe lover distorted by various effects. He looks back with ""Rager teenager!"" which reveals a confessional side to the Australian singer-songwriter and lyrics that call back to a pre-coronavirus era. ""I just wanna sing loud/I just wanna lose myself in the crowd.""

The title track comes last, a sturdy and more conventional song offering a glimpse of an artist stuck in heartbreak. ""It’s all just feeling real now/So far away but I still feel you everywhere.""

Not too little, not too much. Sivan's EP is the Goldilocks of quarantine.

An internal company investigation of claims about the show was prompted by a BuzzFeed News report in July based on 36 interviews with ex-staffers, who complained about or said they witnessed improper and unfair treatment.

Most of the allegations were tied to executive producers and senior managers, including Glavin, Leman and Norman, BuzzFeed News said. The people making the claims against them were not identified.

A representative for Leman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. Representatives for Glavin and Norman couldn't immediately be found.

In statements to BuzzFeed News after the July 30 story was published online, Leman denied ""any kind of sexual impropriety"" and Norman said he categorically denied the accusations.

DeGeneres informed staff of the shakeup Monday in a video conference call, according to Variety, which first reported the development. She said she found claims about the show's environment to be ""heartbreaking,"" the trade publication said, citing unidentified sources.

The comedian and host had sent a memo to her staff after last month's BuzzFeed article, recalling her early promise of ensuring a workplace where ""everyone would be treated with respect."" Something changed, she said, ""and for that, I am sorry.""

The show debuted in 2003.

In a separate July statement, Warner Bros. said parent company WarnerMedia's investigation revealed what it called ""some flaws in the show’s daily management.""

Although not all of the allegations were corroborated, the studio said it was ""disappointed that the primary findings of the investigation indicated some deficiencies related to the show’s day-to-day management.""

Victoria’s lush gardens, heritage buildings and vibrant waterfront have long made it a mecca for visitors to Canada’s most temperate city. But British Columbia’s capital has also been transforming its historic downtown into dynamic neighbourhoods where residents can enjoy all the benefits of being on holiday within walking distance from their home.

“It’s the most glamourous cottage country on earth,” says Jessica Pryde, who grew up in Victoria and loves its vibrant urban scene mixed with easy access to nature’s beauty.

“You can explore the coastline in the morning and spend your afternoons discovering your new favourite café. If you want to venture out even farther, you can jump on a harbour plane and be in Vancouver or Seattle in a matter of minutes.”

Pryde is the director of sales and marketing for The Pearl Residences, one of the few harbourfront communities in the city. Inspired by boutique hotels, its concrete-and-steel design offers 133 luxury homes that have been curated with stylish, timeless interiors that offer all the modern conveniences while maintaining a sense of privacy and comfort. Studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and two-bedroom-with-den floorplans give owners the space and flexibility they desire. Whether they seek a wintertime pied-a-terre or year-round family home, The Pearl provides the perfect lifestyle choice.

“We’ve built in long-term strength but the details are very refined,” Pryde says. “The building is angled in way that provides a magnificent view of the water from many of our balconies.”

The Pearl also offers a fitness centre and lounge that’s perfect for entertaining. “There’s a sense of a boutique hotel experience from the comfort of your own home.”

As tempting as it is to stay indoors, it’s what awaits outside that makes The Pearl unique.

“You walk out your door, and it’s pristine, yet you also have access to world-class restaurants and entertainment. The city is so well suited to people who like all kinds of activities — on water or land. Whether you love to walk, run, paddle your kayak or ride your bike, there are incredible trails that are accessible throughout the city. Tea at the Empress is only a 10-minute walk away, while for the more adventurous, the Galloping Goose is a beautiful 55-kilometre rail trail to Sooke.”

As an added feature, The Pearl connects two portions of the five-kilometre David Foster Harbour Pathway.

With grocery stores and retail amenities all within walking distance, people can leave the car at home. “Not having to use a vehicle totally transforms your active lifestyle and sense of community,” Pryde says. “It’s really freeing.”

As owners of the land and developers of the property, the Farmer family has a deep commitment to the city. Deeply involved in the local construction industry since 1953, The Pearl is their legacy. It’s not just a building for them; it’s their contribution to the city’s resiliency while honouring its charm.

Their attention to detail and commitment to excellence give homeowners peace of mind. This, combined with the enviable location, is even more important in the wake of the pandemic, which has given people time to re-evaluate what they want in life. With the presentation centre open again now that stay-at-home protocols have been eased, Pryde has noticed “there is a renewed sense of ‘what do I want my life to look like’ and ‘what is of value to me.’ We can provide the lifestyle they’re seeking. For them, having everything at your backdoor is transformative.”

Residents also appreciate having all the benefits of home-ownership without the worry and responsibilities of owning a house.

“Single-family homes are a big commitment, and when you can lock-and-leave your home at The Pearl, the entire city becomes your playground,” Pryde says.

She also notes that as the harbourside neighbourhood continues to grow in popularity, so will The Pearl’s real estate values."

“Dog days” are the hottest days of summer, named for Sirius, the Dog Star, whose rising ancient astrologers connected with heat, drought, sudden thunderstorms, lethargy, fever, mad dogs, and bad luck. Any of that ringing a bell?

article continues below

As it happened, my pot luck group met for the first time since before COVID, on one of the warmest evenings of the summer, two weeks ago. We agreed to meet early, at 6 p.m., on my back lawn.

I arranged six chairs and small tables, spaced a little more than two metres apart, in an arc facing the garden with a table at the centre for placing food. For safety, everyone brought her own plate, utensils, and drink. I supplied paper serviettes and a supplementary “drinks” table with water, wine, and hand sanitizer. The downstairs bathroom, just off the carport, was sanitized and supplied with small, individual towels.

Everyone contributed take-out food in the form of pizzas and sushi, and they all brought their own tongs or chopsticks for serving themselves. For dessert there were individual tarts from a local coffee shop.

It was a perfect evening, warm and fragrant. Some of the women strolled through the garden and returned with questions. One wanted to know the names of the flowers in a patch of wildflowers and bee-friendly blooms in one of the plots. She saw many of them as perfect for a small flower garden next to one of her apartment windows.

She began growing flowers in the site this year. Among the most promising ones Marilyn saw were alyssum, candytuft, cornflower, clarkia, and baby blue eyes (Nemophila).

Pat remarked on the hydrangeas in the garden and asked about a problem with her sister’s white hydrangea: Why were the blooms turning pink? The most likely reasons: It is common, as the blooms age, to take on pink tones. The acid-alkaline balance (pH) of the soil can also affect hydrangea flower colour. Alkaline soils foster pink and red. Acidic soils help to keep blue hydrangeas true blue. A soil that is very slightly acidic is probably best for white hydrangeas.

As the light was starting to fade, on came the evening entertainment — The Raccoon Show. A family of raccoons, a mother and four babies, began disporting themselves close by, in a big fir tree next to my side fence and very close to the house. The babies were trying to overtake each other along the branches as the whole lot of them made their way down the tree. They tumbled over the fence onto a slope beside the house, where we were able to observe their antics further.

That raccoon family has been the talk of the neighbourhood as it travels about. I often see them crossing the patio on their way back to their tree. One morning I watched the mother shepherding the little ones down my driveway toward the street.

Not my favourite wild animal, but part of the scene around here.

That was not the end of the evening’s entertainment. With the departure of my friends around dusk, I’d gone to bed and had just fallen asleep when a mighty noise jolted me awake. Thunder, as I’d never heard it before, followed repeated flashes of sheet lightning in a continuing “Sound and Light” exhibit that must have been a massive collision of weather systems — or a dog days show.

Tale of two clematis vines. A surprise this summer has been strong growth and flowers on two clematis vines that have, over the years, come close to disappearing into the landscape.

I first planted a Barbara Dibley on a trellis alongside the carport. When the trellis was removed, I transplanted the vine beside a flowering quince shrub a neighbour had given me. The vine lives and blooms, minimally, in a bed I tend only occasionally, but this summer, it proceeded to dot the top of the shrub liberally with its impressive mauve-pink, carmine-striped flowers.

I thought the Clematis durandii that I planted at the base of a Rosa rubrifolia (R. glauca) had disappeared, but it wound its way up the spiny rose canes to produce gorgeous indigo-blue flowers. Perhaps it was the severe renewal pruning of the rose in late winter, and the compost mulching that followed. Anyway, the flowers were a welcome gift."

The Academy Award winning director of Titanic bought the winery in 2013 for $2.7 million. Beaufort grows 10 varieties of grapes as well as hazelnuts, garlic and cereal crops.

The sale will include farm equipment, a number of recently renovated buildings including the winery, tasting room and wine bar, as well as potential new home sites.

Cameron, who grew up in Chippawa, Ont., has a passion for sustainable agribusiness and owns several businesses, including cattle ranches.

In a 2014 story in the Times Colonist, it was noted Cameron is no stranger to the farming business having worked on his grandfather’s farm in Ontario when he was young. He also bought thousands of acres in New Zealand.

Three other wineries are either listed for sale or recently sold on Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands.

The 6.8-acre Rocky Creek Winery in Cowichan Bay has been on the market for nearly 100 days, and is listed for sale at $2.3 million.

Rick Steves (ricksteves.com) writes European travel guidebooks and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio.","As we’ve had to postpone our travels because of the pandemic, I believe a weekly dose of travel dreaming can be good medicine. Here’s a reminder of the fun that awaits us in Europe at the other end of this crisis.

While food might be an art form in Italy, it’s more like a religion in Sicily. Even if you know Italian food well, Sicilian cuisine will surprise you with its complexity — a legacy of successive waves of settlers and invaders who influenced the cuisine.

The first time you find yourself choosing between fish couscous and spaghetti Bolognese on the same menu, you know you’re at a crossroads of cultures. Thanks to centuries of North African and Middle Eastern influences, Sicilian cuisine includes distinctive ingredients such as couscous, almonds, ginger, apricots, cinnamon, and lots of citrus. Arabs who came here popularized fried foods, which is why so many Sicilian street food classics — and even some pastas — are deep-fried. Sicilian cooking also comes with Greek and Spanish touches.

The Sicilian diet relies on Italian staples such as pastas, olives, and tomatoes, but with a local twist. The island’s warm temperatures and fertile volcanic soil mean that everything from citrus to nuts are available home-grown. Produce is fresh, cheap, and plentiful — and sold at markets that more closely resemble an Arab souk than a European marketplace. Seafood is abundant.

One of the most memorable ways to eat in Sicily is also one of the cheapest: street food, especially in Sicily’s capital, Palermo. Ballarò Market, dating to the 10th century, is the most authentic. Vendors here still maintain the Arab tradition of calling out to passersby in a singsong way, like auctioneers. Food carts are scattered among the stalls, selling panelle (chickpea fritters), sfincione (fluffy pizza with anchovies), potato croquettes and lots of other eats.

The most popular items are the arancine, deep-fried rice balls with meat sauce inside, which are flavoured with vivid yellow saffron and contain no tomatoes. (Sicily’s second city, Catania, and mainland Italy call this dish arancino and add tomato to the filling — two things a Palermo native wouldn’t be caught dead doing.)

For a small island, Sicily has an remarkable range of local specialties. Trapani, on the west coast, is geographically and culturally the island’s closest point to Africa — and the best place to try couscous al pesce, couscous served with a side of fish broth that you ladle on to taste. Fancier variations are topped with shellfish and other seafood.

In Modica, in the southeast, try the grainy, bittersweet cioccolato di Modica.

Sicily was under Spanish rule just as explorers were returning from the New World with exotic new foods, including cocoa beans. Modica mastered this new ingredient, crushing it on basalt plates and adding local sugar, creating an early version of chocolate bars.

In Catania, on Sicily’s eastern shore at the base of Mount Etna, quench your thirst with a seltz e limone (seltz, for short) — fresh-squeezed lemon juice with seltzer water. They’ll ask you “sale?” to see if you want salt added. (It might sound strange, but a little salt makes this brew exceptionally thirst-quenching.)

Sicily also has its own pasta dishes. Anelletti al forno is ring-shaped pasta, baked with tomatoes, meat, eggplant and cheese. Busiate alla Trapanese is a twisty noodle topped with red pesto made from almonds, tomatoes, garlic and basil.

Pasta alla Norma, named for an opera by Catania-born composer Vincenzo Bellini, is made with fried eggplant, tomato sauce, basil and salted ricotta cheese on top. A top-end choice for those who enjoy a taste of the sea is spaghetti ai ricci, spaghetti topped with sea urchin.

Wine has been produced on the shores of Sicily since the time of the Greeks.

The island, whose various grape-growing areas have their own distinctive characteristics, is one of Italy’s biggest wine producers.

Some of the grapes grown here, such as the red nerello grape, can be found only in Sicily. Western Sicily is best known for its Marsala wine, and the Mount Etna area has become a magnet for boutique wine producers for its the rich volcanic soil and old vines.

Wineries cluster around the north slope, like a Sicilian Napa Valley.

Sicilian desserts are also distinctive and delicious, most made with a combination of sugar, almonds, citrus and ricotta. The island’s most famous and best sweets are cannoli.

A crispy fried pastry tube is filled with sweetened ricotta, then dusted with powdered sugar.

The mark of a high-quality cannolo is one that’s filled right when you order it — otherwise, the shell gets soggy and loses its crunch.

After tasting cannoli at a Sicilian pastry shop, I know why they say: “Holy cannoli.”

One thing is certain about Sicily: For locals, the food can be a religious experience.

Current Aeroplan members will keep their account numbers and Aeroplan miles will be converted to points on a one-for-one basis, Air Canada said.

The relaunch on Nov. 8 will allow all members to book seats on any Air Canada flight using Aeroplan points, a change from the current model where seat inventory is limited.

article continues below

It will eliminate the carrier surcharge — which varies from less than $25 to the high hundreds — on flights purchased with points, though a $39 fee applies for trips operated by Air Canada's partner airlines.

Members will also be able to share points with up to eight friends and family members, combining them in a pool anyone in the group may put toward a trip.

The airline hopes the relaunch, planned after it reacquired the rewards program from Aimia Inc. in January 2019, will add another two million members before 2024 to the five million-plus who already hold Aeroplan cards.

The new program, based in part on feedback from thousands of consumers, ""is more important than ever as airlines compete to earn and retain customer loyalty in a rapidly changing environment,"" CEO Calin Rovinescu said in a statement Tuesday.

Passenger revenues at the Montreal-based airline dropped by 95 per cent year over year in its second quarter, prompting 20,000 layoffs as the airline burned through $19 million of cash per day amid border closures and a collapse in demand stemming from the coronavirus.

Air Canada made last-minute tweaks to the rewards revamp in response to the outbreak, prioritizing partnerships with the Uber Eats app and other companies yet to be announced, said Mark Nasr, head of loyalty and e-commerce at the company.

""We did a lot of soul-searching as COVID-19 developed,"" Nasr said. ""We really accelerated these 'every day' partnerships.""

The points that members earn on purchases via eligible retail, hotel and credit card partners will count toward to the tally required to reach the lowest rung of ""elite status"" — 25,000 kilometres of air travel in a year.

For example, an Uber Eats purchase of $50 would yield 100 points for Aeroplan members, and another 50 to 75 points if it was made through a TD Aeroplan Visa card.

Frequent travellers in one of Aeroplan's five elite categories will be able to share benefits such as lounge access and priority boarding with friends and family, even if they are not flying together.

Current Aeroplan members will keep their account numbers and Aeroplan miles will be converted to points on a one-for-one basis, Air Canada said.

The new system will base the number of points earned for a given flight on airfare rather than distance, which currently provides the baseline. That means the points gap between a flight to Asia and a flight across the country will likely narrow, since the difference in distance is often greater than the difference in price.

Meanwhile the new, more flexible pricing model — Air Canada has posted a ""points predictor"" tool on its website — also means more popular routes and times will cost more points than under the current fixed system, while off-peak times and less popular routes will be cheaper, said National Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen.

""We see this as margin-enhancing for Air Canada as it will be able to effectively charge market prices for rewards seats for more popular flights. In addition, it will allow the airline to enhance load factors on less popular flights,"" Doerksen said in a research note.

A flight between Toronto and Vancouver will cost between 25,000 and 35,000 points, according to the points predictor.

The renewed focus on consumer spending — TD announced Tuesday a ""refreshed suite"" of Aeroplan Visa credit cards, set to launch Nov. 8 — expands the loyalty program's potential appeal well beyond the jet set.

""The cards are what drives massive amounts of value. If Bob or Betty don't travel much by air, they can still have a TD or a CIBC or Amex credit card and they can make points on the program,"" said Robert Kokonis, president of Toronto-based consulting firm AirTrav Inc.

""There's all that day-to-day household spending that you can put onto the card that really generates points for the member and through to the bottom line of Aeroplan and then Air Canada.""

The added incentive to plastic comes as a welcome change for Air Canada credit card partners Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Visa and American Express.

Air Canada has said credit card penetration for so-called elite flyers is only 38 per cent versus about 50 per cent for most U.S. airlines.

TD and CIBC paid a total of $1.2 billion to help offset the hefty points liability, acquisition price and other working capital and pension assumptions for Air Canada.

Wale Road and the Island Highway is a non-right-angle intersection.
Steve Wallace is the owner of Wallace Driving School on Vancouver Island.","It is difficult to explain the reason for some intersections on Vancouver Island making the top 10 most dangerous crash list for 2019.

The 101 crashes at the almost completed McKenzie and Highway 1 project is somewhat predictable, but still a little odd. One would think the increased scrutiny throughout the construction phase would be cause for pause. The sheer volume of traffic of all types must have something to do with it.

article continues below

The McKenzie-Highway 17 (Pat Bay Highway) merge area is No. 2 on the list, with 68 crashes. There are some not so obvious differences in this seemingly simple configuration. It is really a double merge and therefore not just a single lateral move that drivers must negotiate when heading west and entering from McKenzie.

The third highest number of crashes are at the Boleskine and Douglas intersection. This location has been a perennial top 10 contender. It is really the Highway 1 corridor with 62 crashes, but is rather seen to be a city street, as opposed to a provincial responsibility. Left-turn cheaters and a far-lane timing move might be the cause of so many incidents at a very standard type of intersection.

Sixty-one crashes were recorded at the five-headed monster, better known as the Hillside-Douglas-Gorge intersection. This is also a perennial placer in the not-where-you-want-to-be category. Let us all hope this returns to a giant traffic circle, asap, as in days long since gone by.

At least everyone would be going the same direction, eliminating the requirement for a left turn and the potential dreaded head-on collision.

Millstream and the Trans-Canada highway takes a tie for fourth (61) as a relative newcomer to the yearly tally. Westshore makes the big time, in a not-so-envious way. This is partly because of the amazing development as of late. It is possibly the fastest-growing place in Canada. The outsiders looking for a big-box fix can probably be blamed for the entry into the top 10 bumper-car type of collisions.

The sixth most common crash site is a mystery to me. After moving the bus stop at the Pat Bay Highway and Sayward Road, it was believed all was well in hand. The crash rate was significantly reduced, and we all thought this location would never again darken these pages. Well, it only took a few years and here we go again. The crash incidences at this location not only defy logic, but also make a mockery of the large capital expense thought to have solved the problem. Blame it on ferry traffic! Maybe visitors! Who knows?

No. 7 is a golf shot from No. 3. Blanshard and Saanich is an odd member of the top 10. It is a one-way location of Highway 17. One-way street locations are generally safer places. This one stumps me, unless it is once again the fault of the left-turn cheaters turning from Saanich.

Nos. 8 and 9 are in Nanaimo, namely the Island Highway at Bowen and at Mostar. Of all the disappointing locations to make the list, these two are the most difficult to understand.

They are on the same bypass road. Left-turn lunacy? Non-synchronized traffic lights? This is a total mystery to me. I am stumped. How about you? Wide open and lots of room! I never have any problems at these intersections.

No. 10 is a newcomer. Wale Road and the Island Highway is a non-right-angle intersection. What is it doing on the list? It just does not belong. Any thoughts?

Last week’s column about Richardson assumed the first iteration of a shared lane was the preferred option. This was incorrect. A non-through street barrier option was chosen instead, matched with two opposite flow lanes. Thanks to readers for pointing it out.

Cole Pearn abruptly retired at the end of last year's NASCAR season after helping build one of the best teams in stock car racing. His life on the road cost him too much time with his young family and relocating from Colorado to North Carolina had limited their access to outdoor adventures.

They returned to his native Canada to operate Golden Alpine Holidays in British Columbia, a venture that has been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. Racing has also been scrambled, and when the Indianapolis 500 was moved from May to Aug. 23, one of the Ed Carpenter Racing engineers had a conflict.

It created an opening at Carpenter on Conor Daly's car. One of Carpenter's crew members had worked with Pearn before and the connection was made: Pearn, the crew chief of Martin Truex Jr.'s 2017 NASCAR championship season, would work the Indianapolis 500.

""They asked. It was like, ‘Yeah, why not?’"" said Pearn, who called the Indy 500 a bucket list event. ""It's hard when you race your whole life and just completely turn it all off. So it's kind of nice to scratch that itch at the same time.""

Daly, in his first day working with Pearn, was ninth fastest around Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The Chevrolet was even faster Thursday, when Daly briefly sat atop the speed chart before Takuma Sato bumped him down a spot. He ended the day fourth overall in speed.

""We made some really good changes overnight and Cole has an idea of what he wants to do. He's got an interesting way of working, he's like ‘Yep, I know exactly what I want to do,’"" Daly said. ""I really like communicating with him and I think we are vibing really well.""

Daly, making his seventh Indy 500 start, finished a career-best 10th in his hometown race last season while running for Andretti Autosport. A scrapper who has pieced together a full IndyCar season swapping between Carpenter for oval races and Carlin Racing for street and road course events, the 28-year-old Daly is trying to stabilize his career.

Daly will try to parlay a strong 500 into full-time work while relying on a part-time engineer in the 37-year-old Pearn.

""I’ve learned to just try to get along with everyone,"" Daly said. ""I’m a very trusting individual. Obviously, Cole has an incredible amount of experience in the racing world. Was a driver himself, as well. He knows what’s going on.""

Pearn's most noted success is in stock cars and a five-year stint as Truex's crew chief that produced 24 Cup Series victories. The team raced for the title three consecutive years, finishing second in back-to-back seasons after the 2017 championship.

Things began to change when Furniture Row Racing closed at the end of the 2018 season and Pearn and Truex were pulled into Joe Gibbs Racing. They won seven races and were runner-up to teammate Kyle Busch in the title race when Pearn decided he'd had enough.

He has since watched NASCAR on television and provides both insightful and comedic commentary on social media. Pearn recognized he missed racing.

""For sure missed the competition side,"" Pearn said. ""This is obviously a fully different experience, but racing is still racing. You throw a green and checkered.""

To prepare for Indy, Pearn took a very literal approach — ""I had to read the rule book,"" he said.

He's always followed IndyCar and his racing experience qualifies Pearn for the crossover that few expect will be a difficult transition.

""I grew up knowing these cars, it's not like it's anything crazy,"" Pearn said. ""In some regards it is kind of simple and it's just about understanding the procedures and how we set the cars up, learn how tech goes. The physics is honestly the easiest part, understanding how everything else works is the harder part.""

When Carpenter made the hire, he had no doubt bringing in Pearn would be seamless and give Daly a shot at winning the Indianapolis 500.

""I believe when you bring in smart and talented people that have a work ethic, they’re going to figure it out,"" Carpenter said. ""There’s a lot that’s different but a lot of the processes are the same. Some of the language is different. He’s definitely putting in the work to do it, getting prepared. A lot of what we’re doing at Indy is making decisions in the moment. I think we all feel like Cole has those traits."""

Michelaine Lahaie, chair of the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for RCMP, says a video shows an RCMP officer opening the door of a moving police vehicle, which hits the man.

The officer and other Mounties then use force to arrest him while he's on the ground.

Lahaie says the man was then injured in an alleged assault by another detained man in a cell at the Kinngait RCMP detachment and had to be flown to Iqaluit for medical treatment.

She says the investigation is to determine whether the conduct of the Mounties, including use of force, was reasonable.

She says in a news release that the probe will be a Public Interest Investigation into the conduct of RCMP in Kinngait.

""The RCMP members' conduct will be assessed in accordance with relevant law and RCMP policy,"" reads the terms of reference of the investigation released Tuesday.

""Consideration will also be given as to whether racial bias and/or discrimination played a role in the man's arrest and subsequent treatment.""

Lahaie noted the review she has requested by the commission is separate from an investigation by the Ottawa Police Service at the request of the Mounties and an RCMP internal Code of Conduct review.

""I am concerned with the conduct of RCMP members involved in this serious incident and will monitor both the OPS (Ottawa police) investigation and the RCMP's Code of Conduct investigation,"" Lahaie said in a release.

""The CRCC's investigation will provide an added level of scrutiny to the incident, as it will additionally examine the circumstances that led to the man being placed in a cell at the RCMP detachment where another detainee assaulted him and he needed to be airlifted to Iqaluit for treatment.

""I am aware that there is historical distrust by Inuit toward the police and I am committed to increasing RCMP accountability.""

The day after the man's arrest Nunavut Justice Minister Jeannie Ehaloak said she was outraged.

""I have seen the video from Kinngait circulating on social media and am very concerned by the unnecessary force, the violence and the lack of respect I have seen,'' she said in a release at the time.

""Nunavummiut should not fear this kind of treatment and disregard for safety and basic rights.''

Ehaloak said she would formally request a review by the commission.

The gravitas of the moment was not lost on the former journalist and mother of three. After she spoke the English words of her oath of office, she paused to take a deep breath, before repeating the oath in French.

""It's about time,"" Freeland said later at a press conference on Parliament Hill.

She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.

Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.

But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.

""There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,"" said Turnbull. ""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.""

Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.

She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.

""We don't like their representative very much,"" he said of her in September 2018.

Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said ""Mama (does not equal) chopped liver."" On the back it said ""Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.""

When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.

And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.

""She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,"" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.

He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.

""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.

""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.

""I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,"" he said. ""And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.""

She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.

""What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,"" Kelly said on Twitter. ""This has been missing in the department for several years.""

MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.

While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.

Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.

Trudeau said Tuesday that she had been ""a key player in my government from day one.""

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

article continues below

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

The five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations are upset that Ottawa decided to give a surplus allocation of salmon — which arose this year due to reduced recreational fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic — to commercial fishers rather than to the First Nations.

Clifford Atleo, lead negotiator for one of the nations who is also called Wickaninnish, says he feels sports and commercial troll fishers are given more rights to fish in the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

He says the latest decision to shut First Nations fishers out of an opportunity to catch more chinook salmon this year shows systemic racism is ""alive and well"" within the federal fisheries department.

""We feel very strongly we're not being dealt with fairly, we know we're not being dealt with fairly,"" Atleo said.

""It's just another layer of disappointment on the part of how the government deals with us. The government doesn't realize that their attitude toward our people is dyed-in-the-wool ... And I think the government — sometimes they don't realize they're being racist. They've got age-old policies that have never changed.""

A 2018 B.C. Supreme Court ruling directed Ottawa to take a more ""generous approach"" to allocations of chinook salmon to the First Nations given the importance of this species to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people.

The ruling from B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Humphries noted that the government's salmon allocation policy at the time gave recreational fisherman priority to fish for chinook and soho salmon ahead of the First Nations and advised the fisheries minister to reassess this policy.

Despite this ruling and changes that have since placed the First Nations at a higher priority than sport fishers, the Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ehattesaht and Mowachaht/Muchalaht nations say their yearly fishing allocations have not increased.

This year, the five First Nations were told they could fish 7,724 chinook, which amounts to just 1.5 fish per person for the 5,000 members of their communities.

COVID-19 brought a new dynamic to the salmon allocations this year, as fewer sport fishers were able to come due to pandemic restrictions. This means the recreational fleet is expected to catch 15,000 less salmon than was forecasted for this year, according to figures provided by the department.

None of this surplus is going to the First Nations.

""As per approved management plans, the Area G (commercial) harvest is adjusted based on the projected recreational harvests which results in an increase of 15,000 for 2020,"" said department spokesperson Athina Vazeos.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan was unavailable for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Jennifer Kuss, noted the improvements made in giving the five nations a higher priority in the yearly salmon catch allocations, as directed by the courts.

""This change ensures that food, social, and ceremonial (fishing) continues to be prioritized first, and additionally prioritizes the Five Nations rights-based sale fishery over the recreational and commercial fishery,"" Kuss said in a statement.

The Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations argue Ottawa could have provided some of the unused catch from this year to their people to help them support their remote communities. But Atleo said fisheries officials would not even engage in discussions about it.

""The government is trying to say they consult with us, they negotiate with us. They create their fishing plans, put it on the table and it's like take or leave it,"" Atleo said.

""All we want to do is be part of the economy, part of looking after ourselves without depending on government. We don't think that's a lot to ask.""

NDP MP Gord Johns, whose riding takes in the West Coast fishing shores, said he finds it ""disgusting"" the Trudeau government has repeatedly highlighted its desire to restore the Crown's relationship with Indigenous Peoples but has still fought many legal battles with these nations over their fishing rights.

""Indigenous people in our communities rely on this fishery for their economy, for their food security, for their culture. It's part of their way of life. These are salt water people and they rely on the salmon and to be denied their right is shameful, it's disgusting that the government is taking this approach.""

The First Nations are calling on Ottawa to revisit its decision on the surplus salmon for this year to allow them a portion of the additional catch.

""The government has an opportunity to fix this with these (surplus salmon) to come with a fair opportunity to exercise their commitment, in the judge's words, for a generous allocation to the nations and to start moving forward with reconciliation,"" Johns said.

The minister's spokeswoman says Jordan takes any allegations of systemic racism ""very seriously"" and that Ottawa is working with the five nations on a reconciliation agreement on fisheries resources, which is intended to broaden their access in the area, Kuss said.

""The road to reconciliation is a long journey, and Canada is committed to moving forward together. The department has spoken with the five nations on the reallocation of (salmon catch) on multiple occasions and that open dialogue will continue.""

This latest extension will end on Sept. 1 and allows the government to manage immediate concerns, such as recent outbreaks in some areas of the province.

Premier John Horgan says B.C. residents have made sacrifices to keep transmission rates down, but now unsafe gatherings are eroding that progress.

The province announced 83 new cases on Tuesday for a total of 4,677 cases since the pandemic began.

No new deaths were reported, leaving the total number of fatalities at 198.

There are 775 active cases in B.C. and 2,326 people under monitoring because they have been exposed to someone who has been infected with COVID-19.

In a statement, Horgan says the government is committed to getting back on track and it will announce new enforcement measures against those who put others at risk.

""The vast majority of British Columbians are following Dr. Henry's orders of seeing fewer faces in bigger spaces, but we all have to remain committed to flattening the curve,"" he said.

The BC Wildfire Service said crews are responding to the fire on Christie Mountain about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, on the east side of Skaha Lake.

The fire is estimated at 250 hectares and firefighters on the ground are being supported by air tankers.

The service said the situation was ""rapidly evolving"" and asked everyone to stay clear of the area to avoid interfering with the operation.

The order asks residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with pets and critical items.

""We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,"" the service said in a tweet.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a ""fire of note"" on Tuesday.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was smouldering with no open flame but was considered out of control. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight.

Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Firefighters have tackled dozens of wildfires after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions.

Two fires were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

""It was nice to get on the board tonight,"" said O'Reilly.

""I haven't been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it's just one game. I've got to be consistent with it.""

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

""When we take care of the puck it's effective and it's hard on them,"" said O'Reilly.

""I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We've got to stick to our structure.""

Pietrangelo said they've been working on fixing the penalty kill.

""We've been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,"" he said.

""Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.""

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

""They're blocking a lot of shots, they're studying us. They kind of know what we're doing,"" said Miller.

He said they'll make adjustments but aren't going to go back to square one.

""We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,"" he said.

""It's not like we're getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They're a good team. We're a good team. It's going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.""

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O'Reilly, last year's Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play — the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O'Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O'Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler's stick and in.

O'Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

All Western Conference games are being played in front of no fans at Rogers Place. The players are being kept isolated in a so-called bubble between games to prevent contracting COVID-19.

They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club.","TORONTO — Richard Clune remembers the drive — the pain, the anxiety, the uncertainty, the fear.

It was the spring of 2010 and Clune, who had made his NHL debut earlier that season, was finally on the road to getting the help the 23-year-old knew he needed in his crippling addiction battle.

article continues below

With his younger brother, Matt, at the wheel, they drove through upstate New York in a torrential downpour home to Toronto. Clune wasn't sure he was going to make it.

""I was in the acute withdrawal phase,"" he said in a recent interview with The Canadian Press. ""I couldn't sit still for a second. The most logical thing at that point in time for me was to go jump off a bridge ... literally.

""I couldn't really see myself coming out of it.""

But come out of it he did, and a decade later, Clune is sharing his story in ""Hi, My Name is Dicky,"" a raw documentary available on iTunes and AppleTV that details his life from aspiring youth hockey player to out-of-control junior antagonist to pro athlete teetering on the edge — one consumed by drugs, alcohol and mental illness.

His journey to recovery started in earnest on that lonely stretch of highway.

""My brother really had to talk me off the ledge,"" Clune said. ""When I see his face and when I see my other brother Ben's face, that's what gave me strength to live, because I didn't really want to live for myself at that time.

""Matt, at a couple points on that drive, had to do things that no younger brother should have to do and really dig down deep and get me home.""

The documentary from Taylor Prestidge and Haris Usanovic of Upper Canada Films tracks Clune's life and career, recovery and redemption. It includes interviews with Clune's parents, brothers, teammates and coaches.

Clune was driven to be the best as a child, but the pressure led him down a dark path at early age.

""I made that decision I was going to put my head down and not see anything but being a hockey player,"" Clune, who was selected in the third round of the 2005 NHL draft by the Dallas Stars, says in the film.

He began to try alcohol in his early teens as a way to cope, and it escalated quickly once he got to high school and then the Ontario Hockey League.

""I had this hole inside me that made me insecure and afraid of the world,"" Clune recounts. ""I got wasted and was like, 'Wow. OK. I'll be able to do this. I can cope with this. It's like a warm blanket.'

""Alcohol saved me. It was my solution to that problem of being self-absorbed and focused on all the things that made me insecure and self-conscious and in pain and sad.""

But he didn't realize how much of a spiral his life was taking. In junior, he would drive from bar to bar, party to party, drinking, smoking marjiuana and doing cocaine.

""I wanted to walk that line of looking death in the face every day, but still play hockey and do all these things,"" Clune says in the film. ""I don't know how I did it.""

Things got worse after junior when he was living in the United States by himself before making his NHL debut in that fateful 2009-10 season, months before becoming completely unglued.

""I had achieved my goal,"" he recalls on screen. ""But I hated myself.""

Clune eventually checked into rehab a second time — he went once before, but didn't stay — and committed to getting better with a lot of help from the people around him.

After he got out, he resumed his career and went onto play a total of 120 regular-season games in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Nashville Predators. His contract was bought out in 2015, and he was again at a crossroads — retire or keep going.

That's when the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were in the early stages of their massive rebuild, came calling to see if Clune wanted to be part of their program. They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club. At the very least, he would play in the minors and help foster a new culture.

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, who was in charge of the minor-league Marlies at the time, saw something in Clune that could be useful.

""He provides a certain energy,"" Dubas said. ""He provides experience in his life that I thought brought a great spirit to our team.""

Clune played 19 games with Leafs, but the forward truly made his mark with the Marlies. He helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018 and plans to continue his on-ice career, but equally important was how he's helped mentor a number of current NHLers.

He's proud of where he is, and not shy talking about how he got there. Clune still goes to meetings, does the 12 steps and now works to help others.

He also thinks a lot about why he made the decision to live, to fight, and get better, when many others — including some fellow pro hockey players — have gone down a different path.

""In the beginning, it was because I wanted to see my brothers,"" said Clune, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Then it transformed into wanting to live for myself. I started to discover what it feels like to have self esteem and to have love.

""I just hope people realize that they're not alone with how they feel. Don't be afraid to ask for help.""

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

article continues below

""After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,"" Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal's three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first overall by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

""A low-maintenance superstar,"" said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg's senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At five foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn't blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack of getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday. ""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League. I think it was Dale's arrival that really cemented the future of the franchise and I think we all have recollections of that first year, that Calder (Trophy) year and then everything that would follow.

""He was truly a superstar as a hockey player, but I think why he was so loved here was not just that but largely the fact that he made this his home and became one of us. I think everybody shared that sense of pride in Dale's career as a player.""

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: ""All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL's all time greatest players.""

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

""What an incredible human being,"" Selanne tweeted.

Montreal Canadiens associate coach Kirk Muller also had a chance to speak with Hawerchuk in recent days.

""I talked to Dale a few days ago, and we had a good chance to chat. A good friend, had a real good opportunity to play against one of the all-time best players. As a hockey player, we all know how great he was, but he was a good friend and just a really special person, did a lot for charities. It's a real loss for us in the hockey world.""

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk ""one of the most decorated players in our game's history.""

In September 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

""For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I'm ready to fight it,"" he told TSN in October 2019. ""I want to live to tell the story.""

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie's bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames players Andrew Mangiapane and Rasmus Andersson remembered playing for Hawerchuk in Barrie.

""I don't know where I'd be without him,"" said Mangiapane. ""Very sad news today. I owe my career basically to him and the whole Barrie organization.""

Andersson, from Sweden, said ""Dale was a fantastic human being. Such a great person. My first week in Barrie he invited us over to his house and really just welcomed me to Canada. I cannot say enough good things about him as a person. Obviously a real good coach, too.""

""It's awful news.""

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday's opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at age two and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur's record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

""I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive — well maybe a little further now with the traffic,"" he said. ""I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""

""I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,"" he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and '81 with teammates that included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL's top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt like he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year — the youngest recipient at the time — and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

""Just one of the greatest. You could tell from day one. We knew from when he was 18 years old as a player that he would turn the (Jets) franchise around. Certainly one of the best I’ve ever played with and coached,"" said Dallas Stars coach Rick Bowness, who played with and coached Hawerchuk in the '80s.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

""He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,"" said Mike Doran, Winnipeg's director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the faceoff in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux's famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

""It turned out fantastic,"" said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada's call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets ""are etched in my mind every day that I live.""

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes' ring of honour.

Hawerchuk re-wrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia whom he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

""It's like going back down memory lane,"" he said in his induction speech.

""All the experiences have been fantastic,"" he added. ""I mean, sometimes they didn't feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing ... Even though I didn't win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn't change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.""

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets' Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November 2017.

""Tonight we fly Ducky's number high,"" said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue's ""Home Sweet Home,"" before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

""Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,"" said the PA announcer.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

""I've been to every part of (Manitoba), either golfing or playing (softball),"" Hawerchuk said. ""I've gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I'm honoured and I'm very humbled.""

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.

""The focus right now for us on a few certain things and one of them is ensuring if there's an ability for our players to receive some form of payment this year,"" Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA's executive director, said Monday during a conference call. ""They should be able to do that if they have an opportunity.""

While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season. However, 66 players have currently opted out of participating in the 2020 campaign, which could create opportunity for some CFL players to sign deals south of the border and have a chance to earn a football paycheque, either on the active roster or on the practice squad.

While there's no shortage of collegiate players available, the advantage a CFL player has is pro experience, a fact not lost upon NFL personnel people.

The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign. This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.

And players on NFL practice rosters receive at least US$8,000 per week.

Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the CFL is amendable to doing what it can to help its players.

""Where we can do something we will,"" he said. ""We're going to be committed to working towards good outcomes, the best possible outcomes we can have with out players.

""That's not going to mean we're going to be able to do everything but we're certainly going to go into this with a real positive spirit.""

Something else that will be on the CFL-CFLPA radar will be the current collective bargaining agreement, which is slated to expire after the 2021 season. But union president Solomon Elimimian said the two sides covered a lot of ground this time around during talks to amend the agreement for a shortened '20 season.

""Whether we deal with '21 when it comes or after the '21 season I think there's hope there that we can work together,"" Elimimian said. ""Obviously the relationship between the players and the league needs to be one where the players feel appreciated.

""Everyone wants to the league to reach its full potential. The partnership has to be one that's very genuine and the players have to feel part of that. If that happens, the sky is the limit.""

Cavan Biggio also went deep for the Blue Jays and finished with three hits and three RBIs.

Ryu (2-1) struck out three and walked none. The left-hander permitted only one runner past second base and yielded just one extra-base hit to a team that came in ranked second in the majors with a .467 slugging percentage.

Rather than vie for strikeouts, Ryu said he was focused more on getting the Orioles to hit the ball weakly.

""I was able to keep them off balance,"" he said through an interpreter.

Signed in December to an $80 million, four-year contract, Ryu got off to a shaky start with Toronto in July before showing the form he displayed as a star with the Dodgers. He's given up a total of two runs in his last three starts after allowing eight runs over nine innings in his first two outings.

""That was vintage Ryu,"" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. ""Ryu was outstanding. That's the reason we won the game.""

The two home runs were a factor, but mostly Ryu was the difference-maker.

""They didn’t give Ryu that big contract for nothing,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""You just never know what he’s going to throw. You don’t know what side of the plate he’s going to throw to. He’s really tough on right-handers because he can locate it in. You saw a lot of us get jammed.""

The Blue Jays took control with a four-run third against Alex Cobb (1-2). Three infield hits produced a run before Grichuk delivered a three-run drive over the centre-field wall. It was his third home run of the season, all in the last four games.

""Obviously, the pitch to Grichuk was middle middle and it was a poorly executed pitch,"" Cobb said. ""But most of the pitches that I had, I felt like I executed. I got the results.""

Cobb gave up five runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He’s winless in his last four starts.

After hitting 31 homers last year, Grichuk was batting fifth, sixth or seventh in the order this season before Montoyo decided to move him into the No. 2 spot Sunday to replace injured Bo Bichette. Over the past two games, Grichuk has two homers, four hits and six RBIs.

Pedro Severino and Renato Núñez had RBIs for the Orioles, who have dropped two straight after winning seven of eight.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Bichette (right knee sprain) had an MRI and will receive a second opinion on his injury, Montoyo said. Bichette leads Toronto with a .361 batting average.

Orioles: RH Dillon Tate (elbow contusion) came off the injured list and RH Evan Phillips was optioned to the team's alternate site.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: RH Nate Pearson (0-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his fourth start in his first big league season Tuesday night. Drafted 28th overall in 2017, the 23-year-old is looking to rebound after giving up four runs to Miami last week in 2 1/3 innings. ""I'm developing at the highest level,"" Pearson said Monday. ""When I don't have my best stuff, I'm going to struggle.""

Orioles: LH Wade LeBlanc (1-0, 7.13) has allowed a combined 10 runs over 12 innings in his last three starts.

DeBrusk scored twice while the Bruins scored four straight goals to rally and beat the Hurricanes 4-3 on Monday to take a 3-1 lead in their first-round playoff series.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

""We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,"" Marchand said. ""That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.""

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

""We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do — little battles,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.""

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President's Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk's first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy's hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina's captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy putaway from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston's first six post-season games.

""There's other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.""

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen's late goal.

""That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,"" Williams said. ""We got it handed to us.""

NOTES: David Pastrnak had a goal and an assist in Boston’s double-overtime win in Game 1, but hasn’t played since. He had 48 regular-season goals to tie Washington’s Alex Ovechkin for the league lead. … Carolina played without 20-year-old Andrei Svechnikov, who was injured when his leg twisted awkwardly beneath him late in the third period of Saturday's loss. ... DeBrusk scored his 12th and 13th playoff goals since his 2018 post-season debut. … The Hurricanes were also without D Joel Edmundson for the third straight game. … Jake Gardiner assisted on Williams’ first-period goal for his first post-season point with Carolina.

The latest price list from research firm Random Lengths released Thursday shows SPF (spruce, pine, fir) two-by-four boards at a ""mindboggling"" record level of US$760 per thousand board feet, up $82 on the week, according to Kevin Mason, managing director of ERA Forest Products Research.

""You've got buyers who care more about just getting product than they do about the price,"" he said in an interview.

""The companies have purchase orders sitting on the desk and it's, like, when you get product, send it to us, and just tell us what we owe you. Buyers don't care. Right now, it's an absolute panic, a scramble to get product.""

The run-up over the past several weeks has demolished the previous North American record high of US$650 set in mid-2018, he said, adding prices for other building products are rising just as quickly.

Homebuilders say increases this year to date will translate into $8,000 to $10,000 more to build a typical single-family house in Canada.

Jayman Built Homes will have to consider passing on its higher costs to customers when lumber supply contracts expire at the end of August, said president and chief operating officer Dave Desormeaux.

""Most builders, I believe, would just pass it on and increase the price of a home for the cost of the materials,"" he said, adding his firm, which plans to build about 700 homes this year in Edmonton and Calgary, has the capacity to absorb short-term commodity fluctuations.

""Right now we're not affected but, come Sept. 1, when we're building houses, it's going to be a huge increase for us because we've eaten it (higher prices) along the way.""

But Bobby Richardson, whose Woodlands Mountain Homes builds five or so custom homes per year in Bow River Valley communities west of Calgary, says he has no choice but to pass his higher costs on to current customers.

The rise in demand comes from increased interest in renovations by people working from home during the pandemic, said Mason, along with a strong housing market in Canada and the U.S. fuelled by people's renewed appreciation of having their own homes and aided by extremely low interest rates.

Supply, meanwhile, has fallen as several mills in British Columbia were closed over the past year due to a shortage of wood fibre after a mountain pine beetle infestation and recent wildfires. Those mills aren't likely to reopen soon, he said.

Many North American mills curtailed production temporarily earlier this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

Lumber production was about 1.6 billion board feet lower in April and May compared to the same months in 2019, said analyst Paul Quinn of RBC Dominion Securities in a report. That's equivalent to removing about 4.5 per cent of total 2019 production in North America.

""We expect that actual demand was higher than production in both April and May due to strong R&R (renovation) demand, which resulted in distributors drawing down inventory levels,"" he said, adding the tight market could persist even though most curtailed mills have returned to production by the end of June.

""With new residential construction returning with a vengeance in June-July, we expect that even normal supplies would be wholly inadequate to meet demand.""

Canadian lumber production declined by 18.9 per cent in May, he said, with B.C. production down 26.2 per cent year-over-year to 677 million board feet. In the U.S., production fell by 6.8 per cent.

In a research report, CIBC analysts point out that current lumber prices are just two per cent less than the all-time peak in November 1996 when the price for two-by-fours hit US$480 (or US$775 in today's dollars after adjusting for inflation).

Canadian lumber producers coming off better-than-expected second quarter financial reports are making gains on the commodity price rally as investors flock to snap up their shares.

On Friday, West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd., Interfor Corp. and Canfor Corp. all rose to new 52-week high stock prices on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

Mortgage rates have been falling in recent weeks.

While most borrowers do not pay anything close to the benchmark posted rate for a mortgage, the rate is used when assessing borrowers as part of a financial stress test.

The check is meant to ensure homebuyers will be able to make their mortgage payments in the future if rates increase from the where they are today. The drop in the benchmark rate makes the test is easier.

According to Ratehub.ca's mortgage affordability calculator, a family with an annual income of $100,000, a 10 per cent down payment and five-year fixed mortgage rate would have qualified for a home valued at $523,410 under the 4.94 per cent qualifying rate. Under the new rate, they can now afford $531,230.

Laird said the rate drop was hardly a surprise because when underlying rates have been dropping, eventually posted rates catch up.

Though the decrease will help many, he categorized it as ""not a major change.""

""Anyone was qualifying for a mortgage no problem, they are unaffected,"" he said.

""Anyone who was not close to qualifying, they are also not affected.""

So I would encourage people to check their credit report and make sure that everything on there looks right.""","TORONTO — Hundreds of thousands of Canadians have been negotiating with lenders over the past few months, hoping to hold off paying debt amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Now, those payments are beginning to filter through the credit reporting system.

""We have seen the average number of accounts that are in a payment deferral status triple since before the pandemic,"" says Eva Wong, co-founder and chief operating officer of Borrowell, which offers free credit scores and reports.

""It shouldn't impact the credit score, but it should show up on the credit report.""

The Canadian Bankers Association said that as of June 30, 760,000 account holders had negotiated mortgage deferrals or skipped payments, while 445,000 had requested deferral for credit card debt.

According to Equifax, deferred payments — many agreed to as part of COVID-19 relief programs — don't harm borrowers' credit scores. But the payments must be reported in a certain way, and the status of these payments may not get reported to Equifax for up to 30 days.

It's important to make sure these deferred payments are reported correctly to credit bureaus, because even one false late payment can drop a credit score by as much as 150 points, says Wong. Credit scores are used not only by lenders, but also checked by cellphone carriers, employers and landlords, Wong says. Because it takes time to correct a credit score error, waiting until you ""need"" your high credit score is a risky move, she says.

""Depending on the type of error, the longer it persists, the more negative the impact,"" says Wong. ""If it's showing up as a late payment and it goes to month two, then it's two months of missed payments as opposed to just one. So I would encourage people to check their credit report and make sure that everything on there looks right.""

Anne Arbour, a financial educator at the Credit Counselling Society in Toronto, says that Canada's two credit-reporting agencies, Equifax Canada and TransUnion Canada, are data aggregators, and it is up to the lenders to create policies on how they report the deferred payments. It's important for consumers to get clear documentation of their agreement with their lender — such as a bank — when it comes to how they are reporting deferred payments, she says.

""Get as much detail from the lender, from the creditor, as possible about what a deferral will mean and what their practices as far as reporting it — so, whether it will impact somebody's rating or their score or not,"" says Arbour. ""And if there is any issue or concern, deal with the creditor first, getting as much written information as possible.""

Arbour noted that deferrals are not an automatic license to skip payments — not only must a formal agreement be struck, but many lenders may have explicit instructions on how interest or even late fees accrues while payments are halted.

Taylor Little, chief of Vancouver-based alternative lender, Neighbourhood Holdings, says that many people skipped payments based on reading about deferral programs, without actually checking to make sure whether the lender was offering deferrals or some other type of payment plan instead. Doing that can hurt a credit score, and likely won't be counted as an error, he says.

When checking with lenders, Arbour says people should collect a copy of the agreement, a file ID or reference number, and the name of the agent with whom they spoke, in case this information is needed to file a credit score dispute down the road.

If a consumer notices something that might be wrong on their credit score —such as a deferred payment being counted as ""late"" — the lender is once again the first stop, she says.

""Going back to the creditor themselves is a good first step,"" she says. ""[Equifax and TransUnion] have worked closely with the Canadian Bankers Association, with the lenders, everybody to try and come up with a way to report any deferrals, whether it was mortgages or credit cards, in a way that wouldn't penalize the consumer. But the onus ultimately was on and is on the creditors to change their systems.""

In addition to requesting a fix from the lender, consumers can ask Equifax or TransUnion to investigate a mismarked payment, through a credit report update form or investigation request form. Separately, consumers can also now put a ""consumer statement"" to a credit report to signal to lenders that something is being disputed. Equifax Canada gives an example: ""Be advised that the negative accounts on my credit report are related to the Covid-19 pandemic. I intend to make these up as soon as I can find a job.""

Keeping on top of errors — and being quick to correct them if they happen — is easier if consumers stick with a routine and understand the parts of the credit scoring process, says Arbour. For example, free services that offer credit monitoring offer more frequent updates and are different from Equifax or TransUnion's free yearly reports. Those annual reports from Equifax or TransUnion are also different from the formal scores checked by lenders in a ""hard"" credit check, she says.

She advised that consumers can take advantage of both credit monitoring services and free yearly reports.

""There's no sort of one size fits all answer — very often mortgages don't actually appear on credit reports,"" says Arbour. ""[Mismarked deferrals] haven't been brought up as a concern just yet. . . . I think come September, it might be a different story. Once deferrals are over, unless people are checking their credit report, they won't notice it unless they're in a situation where they're having to renew their term or renegotiate a rate or a debt management program.""

According to a new office market report from Colliers International the vacancy rate for office space in the region increased to 5.9 per cent at the end of the second fiscal quarter, up from 5.1 per cent in the first three months of this year.
The report suggests the vacancy rate will remain fairly stable for the rest of this year, likely getting to 6.3 or 6.5 per cent by the end of the year.

According to a new office market report from Colliers International the vacancy rate for office space in the region increased to 5.9 per cent at the end of the second fiscal quarter, up from 5.1 per cent in the first three months of this year.

That’s largely due to two provincial ministries moving lock, stock and stapler to the Capital Park development in James Bay, according to Colliers vice president Tristan Spark, who noted 80 per cent of the 70,000 square feet of newly available office space downtown resulted from the moves.

Spark said new projects, like the $250 million mixed-used Capital Park development, offer new Class A office space and spur on a flight to quality, which tends to leave older Class B and C buildings vacant or available at lower rents to other businesses or ripe for redevelopment.

The report suggests the vacancy rate will remain fairly stable for the rest of this year, likely getting to 6.3 or 6.5 per cent by the end of the year.

Spark said it could climb to about seven per cent at some point before things normalize, but he points out even at that point the city will be in good shape as its 10-year average occupancy is about eight per cent.

The reason the vacancy rate is expected to remain stable, according to Spark, is the success the province has had in dealing with the pandemic.

“It didn’t really affect offices too much,” he said.

It did result in many government offices and Crown agencies directing their staff to work from home for the foreseeable future, while high-tech firms and other companies that could did the same.

The move to work remotely drastically changed the traffic pattern and sheer number of people on the street in the downtown core, but it didn’t translate into much office vacancy.

Spark said that’s down to companies and government still needing space for employees who can’t or don’t feel comfortable working from home.

“There will always be a need for office space,” he said, noting it may be fine for people working at home now, but that is bound to change in the winter or after the novelty wears off after a year or two. “I don’t think the office is going anywhere.”

He said from what he’s seen government is sticking with more or less the same footprint, but having fewer people in each floor plate to allow for social distancing.

Some companies that had expanded are now considering sub-leasing their extra space and maintaining their current size.

“Over the last 10 years the trend has been to have open concepts and increased employee density. That’s over,” said Spark, adding there will now be more options on the table including working from home for employees. “There will be a return now to traditional offices and more private offices.”

According to the province, which occupies a massive footprint in the downtown, public service workplaces are expected to continue operating with reduced occupancy capacity to allow for social distancing.

Ministries will continue to find a balance of in-office and remote work, and will support employees who choose to work from home where the nature of their work allows for it.

At the same time, some offices have been expanded and reconfigured to allow more workers to return to the ministry buildings while having space for social distancing.

The Colliers report points out there is still plenty of space on the way to market, with 204,000 square feet of office space currently under construction and another 419,000 square feet in various planning stages, like the massive Telus-Ocean building planned for the Apex lot downtown.

Spark said as those developments come to the market, the new space is likely to be snapped up and the older space taken over by the burgeoning tech sector or other businesses and in some cases bought by developers to add more residential units.

“Historically that’s what happens,” he said.

In the short- and medium-term, however, the retail space is expected to feel the squeeze in the downtown especially.

Spark said retail has certainly taken more hits than office space so far, and he’s had some clients opt to downsize their current locations to find more affordable retail space downtown.

“Retail will suffer more and I’d expect to see more of that space on the market in the third and fourth quarter of this year,” he said.

A total of 1,930 starts have been recorded for the capital region for the first seven months, up only slightly from 1,921 Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said Tuesday in its monthly report on housing starts.

What’s notable is that these homes are going ahead as Greater Victoria’s housing market remains strong, even as unemployment last month reached 11.1 per cent — the third consecutive monthly increase.

The capital region has seen single-family housing starts increase as developers focus on major projects in the West Shore, such as Latoria North and South on Royal Bay lands in Colwood.

Smaller lots, low interest rates and lower land costs are among factors luring builders to the West Shore.

Year-to-date, single-family house construction rose by 20 per cent, with 420 starts, an increase from 349 for the same months last year.

Last month alone, the number of homes started in Greater Victoria was 363, up from 307 in July 2019. The majority — 321 — were in Langford, Colwood, View Royal and Sooke.

Of the single-family homes that got underway this year, 273 of them have been in Langford, Colwood, View Royal and Sooke, with 51 in July alone.

Across Canada, a total of 245,604 starts were recorded in July, an increase of 16 per cent from 212,095 in June.

“The national trend in housing starts increased for a second month in July,” said Bob Dugan, CMHC’s chief economist.

“Higher multi-family starts in major urban areas, including Toronto, Vancouver and oil-producing centres in the Prairies drove the national increase.

“Following declines in previous months from COVID-19 measures, higher activity in June and July leaves the trend in housing starts in line with the long-run average level of housing starts.”

Dugan predicted that national starts will trend lower in the near term because of the negative impact of COVID-19 the economy.

Omar Abdelrahman, TD Banking economist, said, “Canadian housing data continues to defy expectations.”

The latest numbers “reinforces the resilience of homebuilding activity, and housing market activity more broadly, despite the unprecedented, pandemic-induced hit to the economy.”

Other than a pandemic-related shutdown in Quebec in April,“homebuilding has shown only a muted response to COVID-19, swiftly returning to pre-pandemic levels. This stands in contrast with more severe declines and more drawn-out recoveries seen in other industries,” Abdelrahman said.

Housing demand now and in the near term will be partly fuelled by past population growth, low interest rates, and general demand, he said.

However, he cautions that lower immigration limiting population growth could reduct that activity.

The Charlesworth building will feature a large mural on an exterior wall of the young corporal, the bomber he flew and the 88th Battalion in which he served. It is being built adjacent to another GMC project, the refurbished Bell Apartments, where Charlesworth and his new bride lived before he left for war.

Charlesworth was 23 when he was killed. He had been married just a year and a half earlier to Elizabeth Rosina May Price on Salt Spring Island.

“It became apparent to us that it would be fitting to acknowledge someone’s sacrifice,” said GMC chief executive Jordan Milne. “It’s a great opportunity to tell his story through mural art.”

An older 21Ú2-storey home at 1015 Cook Street will be dismantled and many of the materials such as doors and stained-glass windows will be salvaged and used in the Charlesworth, a 7,200-square-foot building which will have 28 market rental units and three live/work spaces at the ground level.

The Charlesworth will be set back from the Bell Apartments so a mural on that building of Lady Bell — which pays homage to the suffragette movement — can be seen by people walking or driving along Cook Street between Meares Street and Rockland Avenue. Plaques on the histories of both buildings will be installed for passersby, said Milne.

Lydia Beauregard, who painted the Lady Bell mural, has also been commissioned to do the mural on the Charlesworth.

Construction is expected to start in January and take about 18 months, said Milne.

Milne said initial concept plans from Beauregard won’t only incorporate images of Charlesworth, his bomber and battalion, but also some “whimsical elements” of the period around the turn of the last century.

The 106-year-old Bell Apartments building was damaged by a fire in February 2017. GMC bought the building in 2018 and completed most of the renovations in 2019. Some finishing touches still remain, said Milne. Building permits have been submitted to the city by GMC to convert an old warehouse in the back of the Bell into two townhouse units.

The Charlesworth will also feature a rooftop space with an outdoor kitchen with two gas barbecues, an eat-in bar, formal dining space, artificial turf games space, a chaise lounge and sectional seating areas.

Milne said the space is designed to increase social interaction and will be shared with residents of the Bell Apartments.

“It is basically going to be a game-changer for south Nanaimo,” Ian Porter, Seacliff Properties’ director of development, said Wednesday.

Seacliff intends to build Sandstone over 20 years. Investment “will easily be in the billions,” Porter said.

“It’s going to create employment opportunities on the south side of Nanaimo that are not there not there now. It is going to create shopping opportunities.

Sandstone is at the junction of the Trans-Canada and Duke Point highways.

When Seacliff bought the land in 2018, it came with a previous blueprint for a planned community.

The new version includes a business park expected to generate 5,500 permanent jobs once the project is complete.

Seacliff’s other Vancouver Island properties include Royal Beach land in Colwood, where it plans a mixed-use development, and the Fairwinds golf and residential community at Nanoose Bay.

“We fully believe that Vancouver Island is going to continue to grow,” Porter said. “More people are going to live there. More people are going to want to do business there.”

Nanaimo city hall is reviewing Seacliff’s application for its updated plan and zoning amendments. “Staff are targeting the autumn for council introduction of the amendment bylaws,” said city planner Brian Zurek.

Sandstone would be developed in four precincts: a business park-employment zone, an urban town centre and expansion of two existing neighbourhoods, Chase River and Cinnabar.

If approved this fall, work could start on some residential and the business park in 2021, Porter said.

Seacliff estimates that construction would create more than 1,200 jobs per year.

Property taxes would total $17.67 million annually once the project is completed, with development cost charges adding up to $51.9 million for the project’s lifetime total, Seacliff’s submission states.

Sandstone could eventually have up to 3,200 homes in a range of single-family, duplexes, townhouses and apartment style homes. Some would be rental. Smaller lots and suites would contribute to affordability, the submission said. The developer is proposing a formula to contribute to the city’s affordable housing fund.

The town centre would have 2,000 residential units, some in towers, which could be up to 20 storeys. The town centre would include 550,000 square feet of commercial, offices and service uses.

In the Cinnabar neighbourhood, plans call for up to 600 detached homes and attached/townhouses, with space for a future elementary school.

The Chase River (Cedar Road) area would allow for up to 600 lower-density homes, and for a 100-acre reserve of riverfront land.

About half the lands in the Chase Valley and Cinnabar neighbourhoods would be allocated for parks, open space, and trails.

In the business-employment area, a maximum six million square feet could be constructed.

Mike Parker, Chase River Community Association chairperson said, “Generally I think there is a lot of support for the project from residents and from the association as a whole. It has been an ongoing process with numerous players saying they are going to develop that section of land over 30 years.

“It finally looks like somebody is going to come through and actually start developing it.”

The population is booming in the south end of Nanaimo and residents are eager for more services, Parker said. “We need more retail … we need jobs, we need affordable housing, we need rental units — all that stuff.”

Sandstone has taken into account much of what residents are seeking, Parker said. He is pleased with the proposed amount of green space.

A major existing concern for area residents is heavy traffic, especially along Extension Road and additional development could add to that, he said.

Nanaimo Mayor Leonard Krog said the project offers an opportunity for the community to get together, in conjunction with B.C. Transportation Ministry, to work out long-term solutions around traffic and active transportation.

Krog welcomed the business area portion of the project, saying “Nanaimo is very short on industrial land of any kind.”

Sandstone could bring major changes to the city’s southern area, he said. “It is also has potential to provide amenities that we might not otherwise see there for a number of years.”

Not all development proposals come to fruition, Krog noted, but in this case, “a substantial developer with deep pockets is working with the community to try and create a development that will hopefully have strong community support, particularly that part of town.”

Colliers noted that the “thin levels of transactions” in the second quarter totalled $200 million with the sale of 12 properties across the country. This compares with 36 sales and a total dollar volume of $666 million in the second quarter of 2019.

Four of the transactions were hotels in Vancouver and Victoria, bought by B.C. Housing to temporarily shelter homeless people. The province paid a total of $107 million.

B.C. Housing was also responsible for the single largest deal this year, with its purchase of the 110-room Howard Johnson hotel on Granville Street for $55 million, a price that pencils to about $500,000 per room.

At the start of the third quarter, B.C. Housing also purchased the American Hotel on Main Street, Vancouver, for $17.9 million.

For the first half of this year, hotel sales volumes in Canada totalled $500 million, down from $830 million in the first six months of 2019.

The hotel industry is suffering from pandemic-related travel restrictions that has seen international overnight visitors plunge 92 per cent in the second quarter compared to a year earlier.

All conferences booked into hotels have been cancelled or gone online since the pandemic began.

Nationally, the revenue per available room in Canadian hotels, a key industry metric, is down 54.9 per cent this year compared to 2019, Colliers reports.

Hotel occupancy fell to a record low of 12 per cent in April before recovering to an average of 28.9 per cent in early July, still about half of the rate a year earlier.

""Sales activity was extremely strong for the first full month of summer. Normally we would see sales dip in July relative to June as more households take vacation, especially with children out of school,"" said Lisa Patel, president of the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board.

article continues below

The board said 11,081 existing homes changed hands during July, 29.5 per cent more sales than July 2019 and a new record high for the month.

Average home prices are also up 16.9 per cent from a year ago, at $943,710, the board said.

Patel said there is evidence the home market is tightening — with buyers competing as homes are being sold faster than new listings are added to the market.

""Competition between buyers continued to increase in many segments of the GTA ownership housing market in July, which fuelled a further acceleration in year-over-year price growth in July compared to June,"" said the board's chief market analyst, Jason Mercer.

Patel suggested that homebuyers and sellers have put off summer travel and are playing catch-up on their housing plans, after the City of Toronto entered Stage 3 of reopening from COVID-19 restrictions.

Davelle Morrison, broker at Bosley Real Estate Ltd., agreed that months in lockdown have given buyers time to think about exactly what they want in a home. Research done, buyers are coming to the market ready to sign on the dotted line, she said.

""People have had three months to sit and observe what they want for their living space,"" said Morrison. ""People are starting to recognize that the Toronto real estate market holds value. They thought there would be a crash, and they were waiting for one. The time period to get a deal was March and April, and it is over . . . so people aren't on the sidelines anymore.""

Nasma Ali, founder of One Group Toronto Real Estate, said sellers often spend winter months prepping their house to sell in spring, when the greenery will improve their curb appeal. The listings that usually crowd the market in March and April came all at once this year — in June.

Last summer, buyers would have been fatigued by the stressful process of making offers. Listings that hit the market in spring usually pile up a bit more by summer, she added.

But this year, that process has sped up, she said.

""Spring never came, and when June came ... I could feel the difference in demand. The demand was just on fire,"" said Ali.

That raises the question of how long the pent-up demand will fuel the market, Ali says.

""People are always waiting for a crash, and now people are waiting for a crash in fall,"" Ali says. ""(Unlike in June,) houses are not selling with 10 to 20 offers. . . . . August is historically slow, people want to enjoy the last few weeks of summer and look again after Labour Day. ""

Morrison said that even among pessimists, she’s seeing a strong urge to move, with one client looking for a backyard in case schools close again in the future.

""People are saying, ‘We realized we won't be able to travel for the next couple of years, we need a getaway that’s local,’"" says Morrison.

But both Ali and Morrison noted that the market for detached houses is different from the condo or rental markets.

TRREB said low-rise homes, especially outside the downtown core, led the upward trend, with overall prices jumping most in Durham, Orangeville and South Simcoe county. The bulk of sales for July were detached homes (5,633 sold) and condo apartments (2,423 sold).

""Condo sales downtown are slower and there are so many factors. The obvious factor is Airbnbs, which have flooded the rental market as more of those investors chose a one-year rental rather than selling,"" said Ali.

""A lot of people are saying they are done with condo living. There is no immigration and that was a huge driving force of urban living.""

Morrison also said landlords are having a harder time filling rental spaces amid a greater supply of condos for rent, alongside unemployment among tenants. While mortgage deferral programs will end in the autumn, Morrison said she’s not sure how many houses will hit the market as a result.

As prices rose again in July, TRREB said it supports housing affordability measures that increase the supply of housing.

The real estate board reiterated support for building more ""missing middle"" housing, such as low-rise apartments and townhouses, as well as a provincial push for transit-oriented communities.

On the other hand, the board did decry any policy suggestion that capital gains tax should be applied to the sale of a principal residence, saying a tax would not help bridge the wealth-creation gap between renters and owners.

""The long-term solution to housing affordability in Canada, for both ownership and rental, is to ensure that there are adequate and appropriate types and tenures of housing available in the market,"" said TRREB chief executive John DiMichele.

Multiple bids are coming in for desirable properties despite worldwide uncertainty about the implications of the pandemic.

Justin Cownden, real estate agent with Pemberton Holmes Real Estate, said a client decided not to make an offer on a Shawnigan Lake house last month because 10 offers had already been submitted. The successful bid came in above asking price with no conditions.

Cownden is seeing a “lot of activity,” in all levels of the market as it rebounds after cooling during the first months of the pandemic.

Similar to last month, sales of $2-million-plus properties in the capital region climbed. High-end sales skew the average price.

In July a total of 30 single-family-homes sold for more than $2 million and of those, four went for more than $4 million. In July of last year, there were nine single-family sales of more than $2 million, the board said Wednesday.

As well, five condominiums sold for more than $1 million.

In June, 23 single-family houses sold for more than $2 million.

Developer Stan Sipos earlier sold 80 per cent of the 57 units in his Customs House luxury condominium project overlooking Victoria Harbour and expects to release the remaining units for sale in the fall. Those will probably be priced at $1.8 million to $6 million. The penthouse sold for $11 million.

“We are getting lots of calls. Lots of interest from all over the place,” including the U.S., Sipos said.

Victoria is appealing because it is quiet, offers a good lifestyle and has fared well during the global crisis, he said.

Sipos has heard of multiple offers for Oak Bay properties and of two sales which took place over video applications without the buyer being present.

Real estate board president Sandi-Jo Ayers said sales numbers in the capital region were unusually high for June and July.

“But we are not in a typical season. We cannot derive an ongoing trend nor forecast by looking at activity because we know the market is subjected to unusual factors amidst a health crisis.”

It is likely that spring demand moved into the summer, she said.

“Time will tell if these factors are resulting in a very compressed cycle of activity or if this trend will persist in the fall.”

The benchmark value for a single-family house in the core area was $910,400 last month, up from $861,100 in the same month a year ago.

A benchmark represents changes in value for a typical home in a specific area, a measure which real estate boards say is more representative than an average price. The core area is made up of Victoria, Saanich, Esquimalt, Oak Bay, and View Royal.

A long-term, low supply of properties for sale is continuing in this area, Ayers said.

“Though we had a good number of new listings come to market this month, many of those listings were snapped up by buyers.

By the end of July, there were 2,653 active listings — 10 per cent fewer properties than in July 2019.

“Right now we have a lot of demand for single-family homes without the numbers to meet demand — prospective buyers are often entering into multiple offer, competitive situations or are unable to find appropriate properties,” Ayers said.

For the area north of the Malahat, Vancouver Island Real Estate Board president Kevin Reid also noted interest in single-family homes.

“An interesting development we’re noting is that there seems to be more demand for single-family homes and less interest in condominiums and townhouses at the moment.

“It makes us wonder whether quarantine and lockdown have instilled a desire for more space among buyers.”

A total of 892 units sold last month, a four per cent decline from July of last year.

The benchmark price of a single-family home board-wide was $545,700 in July, an increase of six per cent from the previous year.

The chimney project — costing hundreds of thousands of dollars — is part of an overall upgrade of the 1892 heritage building at 2110 Store St., purchased from B.C. Hydro by developer Chris Le Fevre.

article continues below

It’s one of two projects Le Fevre is working on at the northern edge of Old Town. The other is his new Ironworks development, with 85 condominiums plus commercial space at Store and Chatham streets, across from Capital Iron.

The Powerhouse’s chimney was wrapped up for safety reasons and scaffolding has been installed. Le Fevre said it hasn’t been touched for decades, so a “substantial portion” of the masonry is being rebuilt.

He would not be specific, but said the cost to remediate the 20,000-square-foot building is several million dollars.

The former industrial building is now rented by Metropol Industries, which specializes in printing and marketing. Le Fevre said work on the exterior of the Powerhouse, and “cleaning the building up,” has been ongoing for nearly a year.

Le Fevre first built an access road into the property, required by the city for the Powerhouse to be subdivided from the adjacent B.C. Hydro lands.

The Powerhouse was constructed to a high industrial standard. Le Fevre calls it the most rugged heritage building he has worked with. “The reason is that it was built originally as a blast-proof building because it was generating power with generators.”

It was designed by architect and former mayor John Teague — who also designed Victoria City Hall — and is listed on the federal-provincial register of Canada’s historic places.

“The value of this building lies in its solid purpose-built form, simple Romanesque detailing, and large, open interior spaces,” says the register. “This powerhouse is an edifice in the Upper Harbour industrial area, and contributes to the diversification of Victoria’s architectural heritage.”

Built as a steam-generating plant, the Powerhouse provided power for the city’s newly electrified street lights and the city’s early trams, the register says. “It facilitated the modernization of the city as it grew in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.”

Just to the south, Le Fevre’s five-storey Ironworks development at Store and Chatham streets has been completed. It is the first phase of Ironworks, with a second stage of a similar size planned.

The name and the rust-coloured corten exterior of Ironworks were chosen to reflect the area’s industrial past.

The former Albion Iron Works was on Chatham Street and the Capital Iron building across the street was originally a marine-scrap business. Le Fevre said he spotted rusted metal on the landscape when he was riding his motorcycle in the high desert in California, and decided that kind of look would suit the exterior of his Ironworks project.

The first occupants move into Ironworks in early August. The project was 60 per cent pre-sold and remaining units are going on the market in a couple of weeks, he said.

Commercial space will likely be taken up by a restaurant, coffee shops and smaller food-service outlets.

Le Fevre has redeveloped more than 10 Old Town buildings, repurposing often rundown structures for residential and commercial uses.

After 17 years, he is nearing completion on his Railyards development on the north side of the Point Ellice Bridge. Construction starts next year on the final building, featuring townhouses and micro-sized affordable units. Once that’s finished, about 400 homes will have been constructed in the Railyards.

Le Fevre has other projects underway, including townhouses in Ucluelet, as well as townhouses and commercial space in Revelstoke’s historic district. He has also purchased more than 600 acres in Landers and the Joshua Tree area in California, where he plans to build small homes.

Spinnakers Brew Pub, which had been leasing space in one of the warehouses for three years, purchased 808 Viewfield Rd. for $11.25 million last year.

Lindsay said Driftwood considered purchasing the 836 Viewfield property, where it had been leasing about 20,000 square feet of space for its bottling and canning operation, but realized it would be too expensive to buy the lot and move the brewery as well.

“This will be quite a change for us as we have been operating out of three locations — the brewery on Hillside [Avenue], our distribution warehouse and sales office on Ellery Street and the packaging space,” he said.

Lindsay said demolition and renovations are expected to start soon, with hopes that they will move the brewery over and open in spring 2021.

The new space will allow the brewery to play a bit of catch-up with the times. When it started in 2008, there were no tasting rooms attached to breweries, and the Hillside Avenue location never had enough space for them to expand.

“Part of this move will mean having a customer experience like Phillips Brewing has here and like most craft brewers in Vancouver,” Lindsay said.

“It’s an opportunity to be at a place where people can come and spend a little time, COVID permitting.”

Lindsay said the success of Driftwood, which rode the second wave of craft beer expansion when it started in 2008, has paved the way for such a move.

“We were the victims of our own success in a way. It was the problem we always wished for — not having enough space,” he said.

That is no longer a problem, though he said they are still trying to navigate their way though the pandemic.

He said while the volume of alcohol being sold might have increased overall, local brewers report sales to bars and restaurants are way down. That has improved slightly as more venues open.

“People forget the tourist piece in Victoria and downtown Vancouver is huge and that has not been filled,” he said. “At the same time, the local market has been fantastic for us.”

He said they have reaped the reward of starting their canning lines two and half years ago.

The move to Viewfield Road creates something of a craft beer hot spot as it will now sit across the street from Lighthouse Brewing and connects to the Four Mile Pub via the Galloping Goose Regional Trail.

The CRD has done well in the real estate game with the two warehouses, which will in turn benefit taxpayers.

Apart from the $3.7-million net profit expected from the combined sales of the lots, the warehouses had been covering their costs via lease agreements over the past few years.

“This is good news for taxpayers, as this positive return on investment will be credited to the Core Area Wastewater Treatment Project participants,” said Susan Brice, chairwoman of the CRD’s governance and finance committee.

“CRD staff did an incredible job managing the property, generating positive cash flow and securing tenants that are remaining in place after the change in ownership. Taxpayers will end up benefiting from the improvements and sale of this asset.”

A condo self-insurance plan would be many times bigger and more complicated than that.","A new idea has bubbled up in the legislature since the condo insurance crisis started boiling over. It’s the concept of self-insurance — providing a means for condo residents to manage their own insurance coverage.

They now rely on insurance companies who last year started jacking rates up by a shocking degree and raised deductibles even more, in the face of losses in that market.

article continues below

Many strata councils have to share some of the blame. The losses stem mostly from constant water-damage claims, 11,000 in the peak year of 2018.

Many of them arise from lax strata boards adopting a habit of relying on insurance rather than maintaining properties properly.

The NDP government has introduced legislation in response to the skyrocketing premium and deductible increases. But the measures simply won’t make much difference to thousands of residents who this year are paying several times more than they did last year, for far less coverage.

The bill was introduced simply because the government had to do something. The crisis is so acute — and the effects are going to be so pervasive — that some kind of action had to be started. So officials put together a few marginal changes to buy some time until there’s a better idea.

There’s already a potential one at hand that needs a close look. A handful of readers suggested self-insurance to me during earlier coverage of this crisis in March.

Now an MLA is endorsing the concept.

Liberal critic Mike de Jong explored self-insurance as an option in the legislature last week and talked himself into supporting it.

Now all he has to do is talk the government into the same position. That will be an uphill struggle. NDP ministers don’t normally look to Liberals for good ideas. They shunned legislation the Opposition proposed to deal with the condo crisis.

But the problem is so serious, they might have to broaden their horizons. And the COVID-19 emergency has overtaken some of the old battle lines, which might change the dynamics.

Recalling the origins of the credit union movement after the Second World War — when farmers couldn’t get loans from banks they essentially started their own — de Jong said: “ They took matters into their own hands.”

He said the idea of pooling resources and looking after each other has merit on the condo scene.

Particularly because B.C. is the only place in Canada that provides the legal framework needed for such a scheme.

Entities created to insure certain limited pools are called “captive insurance companies.” There about 20 of them in B.C., the only such designated ones in Canada. Most are obscure firms that provide coverage to a very small class of clients.

It would be a big change and take a huge amount of work to create such an arrangement. It would also likely need transitional funding from government to get started.

De Jong said: “I believe it’s possible. I don’t think it’s possible on the fly. I think it requires a commitment from the government.”

Condo residents now are facing a situation where de Jong characterized insurance companies’ attitude as: “Take it or leave it. We don’t like the risk profile. Those are our rates. Too bad for you if they’re going to increase 70 per cent, 200 per cent, 300 per cent or 400 per cent.”

He said in a self-insurance scheme strata boards would be “pretty guarded” about the damage claims it accepts and more motivated to keep maintenance up to date because payouts would be made out of residents’ own pockets, rather than some overseas insurance company.

“This is something that I believe is worth pursuing. What we have now is not acceptable.”

The NDP bill currently being debated would allow strata boards to dip into contingency funds to pay premiums and toughens requirements for maintenance reporting. It generally requires more disclosure by strata councils and imposes more clarity.

It doesn’t tackle runaway premium hikes.

The closest model to what de Jong outlined is the Municipal Insurance Association of B.C., which covers all local governments.

It was developed after a similar insurance crisis in the 1980s and has offered dependable rates for years, even returning dividends to members.

A condo self-insurance plan would be many times bigger and more complicated than that. But there aren’t any better ideas around at present.

The mixed-use project will help transform the municipality, says Mayor Rob Martin, who expects neighbouring developer Seacliff Properties to seek rezoning this fall.

article continues below

Approval for Latoria South, “allows us to move forward from a bedroom community to a more dynamic economy,” Martin said.

Colwood’s commercial base is about to grow now that developer Gablecraft Homes intends to build an 80,000-square-foot retail village with a grocery store, other shops and services.

“We are really trying to build a liveable community and this really feeds into this,” Martin said.

New commercial development such as this will help ease the tax burden on homeowners, he said.

Gablecraft’s mixed-use project went to public hearing this week and council voted Wednesday in favour of rezoning to allow the project to proceed. Martin expects that the fourth and final reading of the bylaws will come up at council’s August meeting.

Royal Bay is the name given to the former site of a gravel pit on either side of Metchosin Road, south of Royal Roads University and north of Albert Head.

Gablecraft has already built about 300 single-family houses and townhomes on its Latoria North property, which is on the water side of the Metchosin Road, along with its Latoria South lands.

It is building out Latoria South with two neighbourhoods, the Commons and the Quarry. A range of housing types will go up with the market dictating the pace of construction. Plans include parks, trails, an elementary school, a satellite fire hall and a transit exchange. Other possibilities include seniors care and cultural uses. The tallest buildings would be six storeys.

Martin anticipates that buildings, such as the supermarket, will feature an interior design suited to a post-virus world.

He figures that the Seacliff lands, which include the waterfront at Royal Bay, will present a mixed-use plan similar in scope, creating a major hub of homes and commercial uses.

Colwood’s population is slightly more than 17,000. Projections say it could reach 35,000 in the next 25 years, Martin said.

Two organizations represent residents, the Royal Bay Community Association and the Royal Bay/Colwood Homeowners Association. The homeowners group has expressed concerns about losing privacy and views and contending with a noisier environment because of Gablecraft’s multi-storey building plans. They fear that traffic will be heavier and that issue needs to be looked at more closely.

The community association is keen to see the new amenities, particularly the commercial area and a supermarket, go ahead. That group praises the transportation plan, which has a transit exchange, cycling paths, sidewalks, and parks and trails.

A mix of opinions was expressed at the public hearing. One resident called Gablecraft’s plan a “thoughtful balanced development” with homes, waterfront and amenities such as coffee shops, and is looking forward to the project being constructed.

Another speaker said that while the project is a tremendous opportunity for Colwood, he fears that too many homes are going up on the space available. He worried that would lead to smaller lots and reduced street parking.

He recommended that the height of the buildings be restricted to four storeys, instead of six.

Developer GableCraft Homes of Vancouver is planning for a shopping village, a variety of home types and space for civic buildings and parks on a 158-acre site in an area called Latoria South.

article continues below

GableCraft has already built about 300 single-family houses and townhomes on its nearby Latoria North site and is planning for another 300, GableCraft president Lance Floer said Wednesday. Every year, about 100 homes are constructed in Latoria North.

Royal Bay is the name given to the former site of a gravel pit on either side of Metchosin Road, south of Royal Roads University and north of Albert Head. The Royal Bay Secondary School opened in 2015 on the west side of Metchosin Road and many homes have already been constructed nearby.

On the east or waterfront side of Metchosin Road, the former Producers Pit gravel operation was purchased in 2012 by B.C. Investment Management Corp., which sold it to GableCraft and another developer, Seacliff Properties, in 2017.

All of the waterfront portion of the property is owned by Seacliff, which hopes to obtain a rezoning in future for commercial and residential development on its 134 acres, which it is calling Royal Beach.

GableCraft has most of the upland portion of the property, where it’s seeking a rezoning to allow up to 2,100 homes, as well as alterations to Colwood’s Royal Bay plan, which is within the municipality’s official community plan. Approval would include design guidelines specific to Latoria South, which would govern things like building heights and features.

Council will also decide on whether to approve a site-specific comprehensive development zone for these lands, outlining allowed uses.

Before the vote, council will hear from citizens in the hearing via an online link.

Some nearby residents have written to city hall to express concern about the plans.

The Royal Bay/Colwood Homeowners Association is unhappy with what it described as a “wall” of attached housing replacing earlier plans for single-family housing. They fear taller buildings will result in a noisier environment.

They are also concerned about a loss of privacy, views and view corridors.

The association says it is not satisfied with a traffic report that was carried out, saying its scope was not broad enough and that it is likely to worsen, not alleviate, traffic problems in the area.

GableCraft said its proposal follows extensive community consultation, with three open houses staged in the past year and a half attended by hundreds of people.

The area dubbed Quarry would include 800 ground-oriented homes, either single-family or townhomes, Floer said. It would include seven acres for a 500-student elementary school, and a half-acre for a future satellite fire hall, plus parks.

The neighbourhood called Commons, a little over 40 acres, is planned as the commercial and mixed-use core of Royal Bay, Floer said. It would become another urban centre for the municipality, beyond Colwood Corners.

“For us, the centrepiece of that will be an almost 80,000-square-foot retail village that has the potential to expand over time as the community builds out,” he said. A 35,000-square-foot grocery store, coffee shops, cold beer and wine stores and a pharmacy are among uses envisioned.

The retail village would be located on the southeast corner of the intersection of Ryder Hesjedal Way and Latoria.

Other uses included in the rezoning application include seniors care, cultural and institutional uses, and a potential civic precinct if that’s something the municipality wants, he said.

The Commons would include construction of up to 1,300 homes, largely apartment-style condominiums, he said. There could be some purpose-built rental, as well.

“Obviously there will multiple parties who will eventually be constructing buildings,” Floer said.

“Our group will build the retail village and the first mixed-use residential as well.”

Most buildings would be six storeys at their tallest, with some four-storey buildings to the west of Ryder Hesjedal Way.

GableCraft’s proposal includes close to 17 acres devoted to parkland — neighbourhood parks, natural areas and trails — as well as a transition area between the two neighbourhoods.

A key feature of the entire Royal Bay development is creating connectivity for residents, whether via a linked trail network or cycling and driving links, he said. A transit exchange is in the plans.

The aim is to develop housing for middle-income buyers who would use the retail centre for their everyday needs, Floer said.

By the time the entire north and south sites are built out, the total population on GableCraft land could top 6,000.

If the rezoning application is approved, along with a subsequent development permit, construction of the retail village could start in early 2021, he said.

The residential component of the development will be market-driven, Floer said, and would likely start in the next couple of years.

The federal housing agency says the seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts came in at 211,681 units in June, up from 195,453 in May.

""Homebuilding has thus far been resilient through the pandemic,"" said Rishi Sondhi, an economist at TD Economics, in a note to clients. ""This is a much different result from some of the more bearish forecasts out there and represents a stark change from most other industries, which cratered earlier on and are just now beginning their slow recovery process.""

Economists on average had expected an annual pace of 198,000 starts, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.

Exceptionally low interest rates and government support programs such as CERB may have helped boost household incomes despite a soft job market, wrote Claire Fan, economist at RBC Economics.

""Against that backdrop it is not so surprising that housing activity has been more resilient than many had been expecting,"" wrote Fan in a client note.

The result came as urban starts of apartments, condos and other types of multiple-unit housing projects rose 13.0 per cent to 154,602 units in June, while urban starts of single-detached homes fell 4.5 per cent to 42,073.

Rural starts were estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15,006 units.

The six-month moving average of the monthly seasonally adjusted annual rates of housing starts rose to 199,655 in June, up from 197,063 in May.

Sondhi wrote in the TD client note that demand for housing could keep homebuilding activity afloat until 2021, but that in the ""medium term,"" housing starts should ease as population growth slows.

An economist at CIBC Capital markets linked the surge in housing starts to Ontario, which loosened COVID-19 restrictions on construction later than other provinces. Royce Mendes, executive director and senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said that it is possible Ontario and Quebec may still be playing catch-up from slowed construction during the first months of social distancing.

""Furthermore, with immigration on hold given travel restrictions, demand for housing isn't growing at the same pace it was prior to the pandemic. As a result, we continue to see scope for a softening in Canada's housing market over the coming months,"" wrote Mendes in a note to clients.

Deputy chief economist Brian Yu says despite values plunging to levels not seen since the early 1980s, home prices have stayed firm because fewer properties were available for sale.

He predicts median prices could rebound to about $710,000 before slipping to around $540,000 late this year or early in 2021.

Yu says unemployment, business and health concerns will further weaken the market, while population growth, which has traditionally propped up the sector in B.C., will slow to a trickle next year, dampening sales.

He says a second wave of COVID-19 has the potential to shave home prices by 15 per cent as more owners already hit by the pandemic's first wave are forced to sell during a second downturn.

The report released Tuesday notes positive developments as B.C. enters the third phase of its recovery plan including restarts in the accommodation, spa, film and television industries.

Vacancy rates could also climb as high as three per cent over the next year, writes Yu, ""providing an opportune time for renters to negotiate rental rates before the market tightens up again.""

1. Saanich: $18,000,000

This huge property in North Saanich is subdividable and has 1,500 feet of ocean frontage. Listing agent: Logan E. Wilson. Image via Realtor.com

The existing house on this property is very modest, considering this is Vancouver Island’s most expensive listing on the MLS right now. It’s a 1983-built, four-bedroom house that is nice but not high end. But the spectacular waterfront lot in desirable North Saanich, ripe for development, is what that price is all about. It is 24.57 acres of non-ALR land spread over two legal titles with 1,500 feet of ocean frontage including a foreshore lease, deepwater moorage and private dock. The local community plan supports sub-division development with density between 48 single and 74 clustered lots. The listing describes it as the “largest sub-dividable waterfront property on Pacific Northwest coast within 10 min of an international airport.” So it’s highly unlikely that house will stay standing under new ownership.

Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

article continues below

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister.
""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.
""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.
MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.","OTTAWA — Chrystia Freeland shattered a glass ceiling Tuesday, becoming the first woman to be sworn in as Canada's finance minister.

The gravitas of the moment was not lost on the former journalist and mother of three. After she spoke the English words of her oath of office, she paused to take a deep breath, before repeating the oath in French.

article continues below

""It's about time,"" Freeland said later at a press conference on Parliament Hill.

She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.

Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.

But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.

""There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,"" said Turnbull. ""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.""

Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.

She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.

""We don't like their representative very much,"" he said of her in September 2018.

Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said ""Mama (does not equal) chopped liver."" On the back it said ""Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.""

When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.

And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.

""She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,"" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.

He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.

""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.

""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.

""I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,"" he said. ""And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.""

She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.

""What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,"" Kelly said on Twitter. ""This has been missing in the department for several years.""

MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.

While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.

Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.

Trudeau said Tuesday that she had been ""a key player in my government from day one.""

The five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations are upset that Ottawa decided to give a surplus allocation of salmon — which arose this year due to reduced recreational fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic — to commercial fishers rather than to the First Nations.

article continues below

Clifford Atleo, lead negotiator for one of the nations who is also called Wickaninnish, says he feels sports and commercial troll fishers are given more rights to fish in the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

He says the latest decision to shut First Nations fishers out of an opportunity to catch more chinook salmon this year shows systemic racism is ""alive and well"" within the federal fisheries department.

""We feel very strongly we're not being dealt with fairly, we know we're not being dealt with fairly,"" Atleo said.

""It's just another layer of disappointment on the part of how the government deals with us. The government doesn't realize that their attitude toward our people is dyed-in-the-wool ... And I think the government — sometimes they don't realize they're being racist. They've got age-old policies that have never changed.""

A 2018 B.C. Supreme Court ruling directed Ottawa to take a more ""generous approach"" to allocations of chinook salmon to the First Nations given the importance of this species to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people.

The ruling from B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Humphries noted that the government's salmon allocation policy at the time gave recreational fisherman priority to fish for chinook and soho salmon ahead of the First Nations and advised the fisheries minister to reassess this policy.

Despite this ruling and changes that have since placed the First Nations at a higher priority than sport fishers, the Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ehattesaht and Mowachaht/Muchalaht nations say their yearly fishing allocations have not increased.

This year, the five First Nations were told they could fish 7,724 chinook, which amounts to just 1.5 fish per person for the 5,000 members of their communities.

COVID-19 brought a new dynamic to the salmon allocations this year, as fewer sport fishers were able to come due to pandemic restrictions. This means the recreational fleet is expected to catch 15,000 less salmon than was forecasted for this year, according to figures provided by the department.

None of this surplus is going to the First Nations.

""As per approved management plans, the Area G (commercial) harvest is adjusted based on the projected recreational harvests which results in an increase of 15,000 for 2020,"" said department spokesperson Athina Vazeos.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan was unavailable for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Jennifer Kuss, noted the improvements made in giving the five nations a higher priority in the yearly salmon catch allocations, as directed by the courts.

""This change ensures that food, social, and ceremonial (fishing) continues to be prioritized first, and additionally prioritizes the Five Nations rights-based sale fishery over the recreational and commercial fishery,"" Kuss said in a statement.

The Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations argue Ottawa could have provided some of the unused catch from this year to their people to help them support their remote communities. But Atleo said fisheries officials would not even engage in discussions about it.

""The government is trying to say they consult with us, they negotiate with us. They create their fishing plans, put it on the table and it's like take or leave it,"" Atleo said.

""All we want to do is be part of the economy, part of looking after ourselves without depending on government. We don't think that's a lot to ask.""

NDP MP Gord Johns, whose riding takes in the West Coast fishing shores, said he finds it ""disgusting"" the Trudeau government has repeatedly highlighted its desire to restore the Crown's relationship with Indigenous Peoples but has still fought many legal battles with these nations over their fishing rights.

""Indigenous people in our communities rely on this fishery for their economy, for their food security, for their culture. It's part of their way of life. These are salt water people and they rely on the salmon and to be denied their right is shameful, it's disgusting that the government is taking this approach.""

The First Nations are calling on Ottawa to revisit its decision on the surplus salmon for this year to allow them a portion of the additional catch.

""The government has an opportunity to fix this with these (surplus salmon) to come with a fair opportunity to exercise their commitment, in the judge's words, for a generous allocation to the nations and to start moving forward with reconciliation,"" Johns said.

The minister's spokeswoman says Jordan takes any allegations of systemic racism ""very seriously"" and that Ottawa is working with the five nations on a reconciliation agreement on fisheries resources, which is intended to broaden their access in the area, Kuss said.

""The road to reconciliation is a long journey, and Canada is committed to moving forward together. The department has spoken with the five nations on the reallocation of (salmon catch) on multiple occasions and that open dialogue will continue.""

The BC Wildfire Service said crews are responding to the fire on Christie Mountain about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, on the east side of Skaha Lake.

The fire is estimated at 250 hectares and firefighters on the ground are being supported by air tankers.

The service said the situation was ""rapidly evolving"" and asked everyone to stay clear of the area to avoid interfering with the operation.

The order asks residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with pets and critical items.

""We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,"" the service said in a tweet.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a ""fire of note"" on Tuesday.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was smouldering with no open flame but was considered out of control. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight.

Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Firefighters have tackled dozens of wildfires after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions.

Two fires were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

""It was nice to get on the board tonight,"" said O'Reilly.

""I haven't been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it's just one game. I've got to be consistent with it.""

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

""When we take care of the puck it's effective and it's hard on them,"" said O'Reilly.

""I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We've got to stick to our structure.""

Pietrangelo said they've been working on fixing the penalty kill.

""We've been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,"" he said.

""Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.""

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

""They're blocking a lot of shots, they're studying us. They kind of know what we're doing,"" said Miller.

He said they'll make adjustments but aren't going to go back to square one.

""We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,"" he said.

""It's not like we're getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They're a good team. We're a good team. It's going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.""

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O'Reilly, last year's Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play — the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O'Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O'Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler's stick and in.

O'Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

All Western Conference games are being played in front of no fans at Rogers Place. The players are being kept isolated in a so-called bubble between games to prevent contracting COVID-19.

They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club.","TORONTO — Richard Clune remembers the drive — the pain, the anxiety, the uncertainty, the fear.

It was the spring of 2010 and Clune, who had made his NHL debut earlier that season, was finally on the road to getting the help the 23-year-old knew he needed in his crippling addiction battle.

article continues below

With his younger brother, Matt, at the wheel, they drove through upstate New York in a torrential downpour home to Toronto. Clune wasn't sure he was going to make it.

""I was in the acute withdrawal phase,"" he said in a recent interview with The Canadian Press. ""I couldn't sit still for a second. The most logical thing at that point in time for me was to go jump off a bridge ... literally.

""I couldn't really see myself coming out of it.""

But come out of it he did, and a decade later, Clune is sharing his story in ""Hi, My Name is Dicky,"" a raw documentary available on iTunes and AppleTV that details his life from aspiring youth hockey player to out-of-control junior antagonist to pro athlete teetering on the edge — one consumed by drugs, alcohol and mental illness.

His journey to recovery started in earnest on that lonely stretch of highway.

""My brother really had to talk me off the ledge,"" Clune said. ""When I see his face and when I see my other brother Ben's face, that's what gave me strength to live, because I didn't really want to live for myself at that time.

""Matt, at a couple points on that drive, had to do things that no younger brother should have to do and really dig down deep and get me home.""

The documentary from Taylor Prestidge and Haris Usanovic of Upper Canada Films tracks Clune's life and career, recovery and redemption. It includes interviews with Clune's parents, brothers, teammates and coaches.

Clune was driven to be the best as a child, but the pressure led him down a dark path at early age.

""I made that decision I was going to put my head down and not see anything but being a hockey player,"" Clune, who was selected in the third round of the 2005 NHL draft by the Dallas Stars, says in the film.

He began to try alcohol in his early teens as a way to cope, and it escalated quickly once he got to high school and then the Ontario Hockey League.

""I had this hole inside me that made me insecure and afraid of the world,"" Clune recounts. ""I got wasted and was like, 'Wow. OK. I'll be able to do this. I can cope with this. It's like a warm blanket.'

""Alcohol saved me. It was my solution to that problem of being self-absorbed and focused on all the things that made me insecure and self-conscious and in pain and sad.""

But he didn't realize how much of a spiral his life was taking. In junior, he would drive from bar to bar, party to party, drinking, smoking marjiuana and doing cocaine.

""I wanted to walk that line of looking death in the face every day, but still play hockey and do all these things,"" Clune says in the film. ""I don't know how I did it.""

Things got worse after junior when he was living in the United States by himself before making his NHL debut in that fateful 2009-10 season, months before becoming completely unglued.

""I had achieved my goal,"" he recalls on screen. ""But I hated myself.""

Clune eventually checked into rehab a second time — he went once before, but didn't stay — and committed to getting better with a lot of help from the people around him.

After he got out, he resumed his career and went onto play a total of 120 regular-season games in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Nashville Predators. His contract was bought out in 2015, and he was again at a crossroads — retire or keep going.

That's when the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were in the early stages of their massive rebuild, came calling to see if Clune wanted to be part of their program. They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club. At the very least, he would play in the minors and help foster a new culture.

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, who was in charge of the minor-league Marlies at the time, saw something in Clune that could be useful.

""He provides a certain energy,"" Dubas said. ""He provides experience in his life that I thought brought a great spirit to our team.""

Clune played 19 games with Leafs, but the forward truly made his mark with the Marlies. He helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018 and plans to continue his on-ice career, but equally important was how he's helped mentor a number of current NHLers.

He's proud of where he is, and not shy talking about how he got there. Clune still goes to meetings, does the 12 steps and now works to help others.

He also thinks a lot about why he made the decision to live, to fight, and get better, when many others — including some fellow pro hockey players — have gone down a different path.

""In the beginning, it was because I wanted to see my brothers,"" said Clune, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Then it transformed into wanting to live for myself. I started to discover what it feels like to have self esteem and to have love.

""I just hope people realize that they're not alone with how they feel. Don't be afraid to ask for help.""

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

article continues below

""After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,"" Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal's three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first overall by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

""A low-maintenance superstar,"" said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg's senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At five foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn't blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack of getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday. ""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League. I think it was Dale's arrival that really cemented the future of the franchise and I think we all have recollections of that first year, that Calder (Trophy) year and then everything that would follow.

""He was truly a superstar as a hockey player, but I think why he was so loved here was not just that but largely the fact that he made this his home and became one of us. I think everybody shared that sense of pride in Dale's career as a player.""

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: ""All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL's all time greatest players.""

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

""What an incredible human being,"" Selanne tweeted.

Montreal Canadiens associate coach Kirk Muller also had a chance to speak with Hawerchuk in recent days.

""I talked to Dale a few days ago, and we had a good chance to chat. A good friend, had a real good opportunity to play against one of the all-time best players. As a hockey player, we all know how great he was, but he was a good friend and just a really special person, did a lot for charities. It's a real loss for us in the hockey world.""

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk ""one of the most decorated players in our game's history.""

In September 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

""For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I'm ready to fight it,"" he told TSN in October 2019. ""I want to live to tell the story.""

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie's bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames players Andrew Mangiapane and Rasmus Andersson remembered playing for Hawerchuk in Barrie.

""I don't know where I'd be without him,"" said Mangiapane. ""Very sad news today. I owe my career basically to him and the whole Barrie organization.""

Andersson, from Sweden, said ""Dale was a fantastic human being. Such a great person. My first week in Barrie he invited us over to his house and really just welcomed me to Canada. I cannot say enough good things about him as a person. Obviously a real good coach, too.""

""It's awful news.""

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday's opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at age two and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur's record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

""I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive — well maybe a little further now with the traffic,"" he said. ""I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""

""I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,"" he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and '81 with teammates that included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL's top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt like he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year — the youngest recipient at the time — and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

""Just one of the greatest. You could tell from day one. We knew from when he was 18 years old as a player that he would turn the (Jets) franchise around. Certainly one of the best I’ve ever played with and coached,"" said Dallas Stars coach Rick Bowness, who played with and coached Hawerchuk in the '80s.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

""He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,"" said Mike Doran, Winnipeg's director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the faceoff in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux's famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

""It turned out fantastic,"" said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada's call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets ""are etched in my mind every day that I live.""

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes' ring of honour.

Hawerchuk re-wrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia whom he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

""It's like going back down memory lane,"" he said in his induction speech.

""All the experiences have been fantastic,"" he added. ""I mean, sometimes they didn't feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing ... Even though I didn't win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn't change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.""

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets' Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November 2017.

""Tonight we fly Ducky's number high,"" said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue's ""Home Sweet Home,"" before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

""Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,"" said the PA announcer.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

""I've been to every part of (Manitoba), either golfing or playing (softball),"" Hawerchuk said. ""I've gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I'm honoured and I'm very humbled.""

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.

And that includes how to allow players under contract to CFL teams the ability to sign elsewhere — most notably the NFL — if the opportunity arises. On Monday, the CFL cancelled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The focus right now for us on a few certain things and one of them is ensuring if there's an ability for our players to receive some form of payment this year,"" Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA's executive director, said Monday during a conference call. ""They should be able to do that if they have an opportunity.""

While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season. However, 66 players have currently opted out of participating in the 2020 campaign, which could create opportunity for some CFL players to sign deals south of the border and have a chance to earn a football paycheque, either on the active roster or on the practice squad.

While there's no shortage of collegiate players available, the advantage a CFL player has is pro experience, a fact not lost upon NFL personnel people.

The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign. This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.

And players on NFL practice rosters receive at least US$8,000 per week.

Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the CFL is amendable to doing what it can to help its players.

""Where we can do something we will,"" he said. ""We're going to be committed to working towards good outcomes, the best possible outcomes we can have with out players.

""That's not going to mean we're going to be able to do everything but we're certainly going to go into this with a real positive spirit.""

Something else that will be on the CFL-CFLPA radar will be the current collective bargaining agreement, which is slated to expire after the 2021 season. But union president Solomon Elimimian said the two sides covered a lot of ground this time around during talks to amend the agreement for a shortened '20 season.

""Whether we deal with '21 when it comes or after the '21 season I think there's hope there that we can work together,"" Elimimian said. ""Obviously the relationship between the players and the league needs to be one where the players feel appreciated.

""Everyone wants to the league to reach its full potential. The partnership has to be one that's very genuine and the players have to feel part of that. If that happens, the sky is the limit.""

Ryu (2-1) struck out three and walked none. The left-hander permitted only one runner past second base and yielded just one extra-base hit to a team that came in ranked second in the majors with a .467 slugging percentage.

Rather than vie for strikeouts, Ryu said he was focused more on getting the Orioles to hit the ball weakly.

""I was able to keep them off balance,"" he said through an interpreter.

Signed in December to an $80 million, four-year contract, Ryu got off to a shaky start with Toronto in July before showing the form he displayed as a star with the Dodgers. He's given up a total of two runs in his last three starts after allowing eight runs over nine innings in his first two outings.

""That was vintage Ryu,"" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. ""Ryu was outstanding. That's the reason we won the game.""

The two home runs were a factor, but mostly Ryu was the difference-maker.

""They didn’t give Ryu that big contract for nothing,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""You just never know what he’s going to throw. You don’t know what side of the plate he’s going to throw to. He’s really tough on right-handers because he can locate it in. You saw a lot of us get jammed.""

The Blue Jays took control with a four-run third against Alex Cobb (1-2). Three infield hits produced a run before Grichuk delivered a three-run drive over the centre-field wall. It was his third home run of the season, all in the last four games.

""Obviously, the pitch to Grichuk was middle middle and it was a poorly executed pitch,"" Cobb said. ""But most of the pitches that I had, I felt like I executed. I got the results.""

Cobb gave up five runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He’s winless in his last four starts.

After hitting 31 homers last year, Grichuk was batting fifth, sixth or seventh in the order this season before Montoyo decided to move him into the No. 2 spot Sunday to replace injured Bo Bichette. Over the past two games, Grichuk has two homers, four hits and six RBIs.

Pedro Severino and Renato Núñez had RBIs for the Orioles, who have dropped two straight after winning seven of eight.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Bichette (right knee sprain) had an MRI and will receive a second opinion on his injury, Montoyo said. Bichette leads Toronto with a .361 batting average.

Orioles: RH Dillon Tate (elbow contusion) came off the injured list and RH Evan Phillips was optioned to the team's alternate site.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: RH Nate Pearson (0-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his fourth start in his first big league season Tuesday night. Drafted 28th overall in 2017, the 23-year-old is looking to rebound after giving up four runs to Miami last week in 2 1/3 innings. ""I'm developing at the highest level,"" Pearson said Monday. ""When I don't have my best stuff, I'm going to struggle.""

Orioles: LH Wade LeBlanc (1-0, 7.13) has allowed a combined 10 runs over 12 innings in his last three starts.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

""We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,"" Marchand said. ""That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.""

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

""We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do — little battles,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.""

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President's Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk's first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy's hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina's captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy putaway from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston's first six post-season games.

""There's other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.""

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen's late goal.

""That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,"" Williams said. ""We got it handed to us.""

NOTES: David Pastrnak had a goal and an assist in Boston’s double-overtime win in Game 1, but hasn’t played since. He had 48 regular-season goals to tie Washington’s Alex Ovechkin for the league lead. … Carolina played without 20-year-old Andrei Svechnikov, who was injured when his leg twisted awkwardly beneath him late in the third period of Saturday's loss. ... DeBrusk scored his 12th and 13th playoff goals since his 2018 post-season debut. … The Hurricanes were also without D Joel Edmundson for the third straight game. … Jake Gardiner assisted on Williams’ first-period goal for his first post-season point with Carolina.

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

article continues below

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister.
""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.
""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.
MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.","OTTAWA — Chrystia Freeland shattered a glass ceiling Tuesday, becoming the first woman to be sworn in as Canada's finance minister.

The gravitas of the moment was not lost on the former journalist and mother of three. After she spoke the English words of her oath of office, she paused to take a deep breath, before repeating the oath in French.

article continues below

""It's about time,"" Freeland said later at a press conference on Parliament Hill.

She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.

Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.

But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.

""There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,"" said Turnbull. ""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.""

Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.

She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.

""We don't like their representative very much,"" he said of her in September 2018.

Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said ""Mama (does not equal) chopped liver."" On the back it said ""Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.""

When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.

And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.

""She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,"" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.

He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.

""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.

""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.

""I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,"" he said. ""And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.""

She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.

""What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,"" Kelly said on Twitter. ""This has been missing in the department for several years.""

MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.

While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.

Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.

Trudeau said Tuesday that she had been ""a key player in my government from day one.""

Clifford Atleo, lead negotiator for one of the nations who is also called Wickaninnish, says he feels sports and commercial troll fishers are given more rights to fish in the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

He says the latest decision to shut First Nations fishers out of an opportunity to catch more chinook salmon this year shows systemic racism is ""alive and well"" within the federal fisheries department.

""We feel very strongly we're not being dealt with fairly, we know we're not being dealt with fairly,"" Atleo said.

""It's just another layer of disappointment on the part of how the government deals with us. The government doesn't realize that their attitude toward our people is dyed-in-the-wool ... And I think the government — sometimes they don't realize they're being racist. They've got age-old policies that have never changed.""

A 2018 B.C. Supreme Court ruling directed Ottawa to take a more ""generous approach"" to allocations of chinook salmon to the First Nations given the importance of this species to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people.

The ruling from B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Humphries noted that the government's salmon allocation policy at the time gave recreational fisherman priority to fish for chinook and soho salmon ahead of the First Nations and advised the fisheries minister to reassess this policy.

Despite this ruling and changes that have since placed the First Nations at a higher priority than sport fishers, the Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ehattesaht and Mowachaht/Muchalaht nations say their yearly fishing allocations have not increased.

This year, the five First Nations were told they could fish 7,724 chinook, which amounts to just 1.5 fish per person for the 5,000 members of their communities.

COVID-19 brought a new dynamic to the salmon allocations this year, as fewer sport fishers were able to come due to pandemic restrictions. This means the recreational fleet is expected to catch 15,000 less salmon than was forecasted for this year, according to figures provided by the department.

None of this surplus is going to the First Nations.

""As per approved management plans, the Area G (commercial) harvest is adjusted based on the projected recreational harvests which results in an increase of 15,000 for 2020,"" said department spokesperson Athina Vazeos.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan was unavailable for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Jennifer Kuss, noted the improvements made in giving the five nations a higher priority in the yearly salmon catch allocations, as directed by the courts.

""This change ensures that food, social, and ceremonial (fishing) continues to be prioritized first, and additionally prioritizes the Five Nations rights-based sale fishery over the recreational and commercial fishery,"" Kuss said in a statement.

The Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations argue Ottawa could have provided some of the unused catch from this year to their people to help them support their remote communities. But Atleo said fisheries officials would not even engage in discussions about it.

""The government is trying to say they consult with us, they negotiate with us. They create their fishing plans, put it on the table and it's like take or leave it,"" Atleo said.

""All we want to do is be part of the economy, part of looking after ourselves without depending on government. We don't think that's a lot to ask.""

NDP MP Gord Johns, whose riding takes in the West Coast fishing shores, said he finds it ""disgusting"" the Trudeau government has repeatedly highlighted its desire to restore the Crown's relationship with Indigenous Peoples but has still fought many legal battles with these nations over their fishing rights.

""Indigenous people in our communities rely on this fishery for their economy, for their food security, for their culture. It's part of their way of life. These are salt water people and they rely on the salmon and to be denied their right is shameful, it's disgusting that the government is taking this approach.""

The First Nations are calling on Ottawa to revisit its decision on the surplus salmon for this year to allow them a portion of the additional catch.

""The government has an opportunity to fix this with these (surplus salmon) to come with a fair opportunity to exercise their commitment, in the judge's words, for a generous allocation to the nations and to start moving forward with reconciliation,"" Johns said.

The minister's spokeswoman says Jordan takes any allegations of systemic racism ""very seriously"" and that Ottawa is working with the five nations on a reconciliation agreement on fisheries resources, which is intended to broaden their access in the area, Kuss said.

""The road to reconciliation is a long journey, and Canada is committed to moving forward together. The department has spoken with the five nations on the reallocation of (salmon catch) on multiple occasions and that open dialogue will continue.""

The BC Wildfire Service said crews are responding to the fire on Christie Mountain about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, on the east side of Skaha Lake.

The fire is estimated at 250 hectares and firefighters on the ground are being supported by air tankers.

The service said the situation was ""rapidly evolving"" and asked everyone to stay clear of the area to avoid interfering with the operation.

The order asks residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with pets and critical items.

""We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,"" the service said in a tweet.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a ""fire of note"" on Tuesday.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was smouldering with no open flame but was considered out of control. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight.

Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Firefighters have tackled dozens of wildfires after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions.

Two fires were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

""It was nice to get on the board tonight,"" said O'Reilly.

""I haven't been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it's just one game. I've got to be consistent with it.""

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

""When we take care of the puck it's effective and it's hard on them,"" said O'Reilly.

""I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We've got to stick to our structure.""

Pietrangelo said they've been working on fixing the penalty kill.

""We've been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,"" he said.

""Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.""

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

""They're blocking a lot of shots, they're studying us. They kind of know what we're doing,"" said Miller.

He said they'll make adjustments but aren't going to go back to square one.

""We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,"" he said.

""It's not like we're getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They're a good team. We're a good team. It's going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.""

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O'Reilly, last year's Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play — the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O'Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O'Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler's stick and in.

O'Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

All Western Conference games are being played in front of no fans at Rogers Place. The players are being kept isolated in a so-called bubble between games to prevent contracting COVID-19.

They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club.","TORONTO — Richard Clune remembers the drive — the pain, the anxiety, the uncertainty, the fear.

It was the spring of 2010 and Clune, who had made his NHL debut earlier that season, was finally on the road to getting the help the 23-year-old knew he needed in his crippling addiction battle.

article continues below

With his younger brother, Matt, at the wheel, they drove through upstate New York in a torrential downpour home to Toronto. Clune wasn't sure he was going to make it.

""I was in the acute withdrawal phase,"" he said in a recent interview with The Canadian Press. ""I couldn't sit still for a second. The most logical thing at that point in time for me was to go jump off a bridge ... literally.

""I couldn't really see myself coming out of it.""

But come out of it he did, and a decade later, Clune is sharing his story in ""Hi, My Name is Dicky,"" a raw documentary available on iTunes and AppleTV that details his life from aspiring youth hockey player to out-of-control junior antagonist to pro athlete teetering on the edge — one consumed by drugs, alcohol and mental illness.

His journey to recovery started in earnest on that lonely stretch of highway.

""My brother really had to talk me off the ledge,"" Clune said. ""When I see his face and when I see my other brother Ben's face, that's what gave me strength to live, because I didn't really want to live for myself at that time.

""Matt, at a couple points on that drive, had to do things that no younger brother should have to do and really dig down deep and get me home.""

The documentary from Taylor Prestidge and Haris Usanovic of Upper Canada Films tracks Clune's life and career, recovery and redemption. It includes interviews with Clune's parents, brothers, teammates and coaches.

Clune was driven to be the best as a child, but the pressure led him down a dark path at early age.

""I made that decision I was going to put my head down and not see anything but being a hockey player,"" Clune, who was selected in the third round of the 2005 NHL draft by the Dallas Stars, says in the film.

He began to try alcohol in his early teens as a way to cope, and it escalated quickly once he got to high school and then the Ontario Hockey League.

""I had this hole inside me that made me insecure and afraid of the world,"" Clune recounts. ""I got wasted and was like, 'Wow. OK. I'll be able to do this. I can cope with this. It's like a warm blanket.'

""Alcohol saved me. It was my solution to that problem of being self-absorbed and focused on all the things that made me insecure and self-conscious and in pain and sad.""

But he didn't realize how much of a spiral his life was taking. In junior, he would drive from bar to bar, party to party, drinking, smoking marjiuana and doing cocaine.

""I wanted to walk that line of looking death in the face every day, but still play hockey and do all these things,"" Clune says in the film. ""I don't know how I did it.""

Things got worse after junior when he was living in the United States by himself before making his NHL debut in that fateful 2009-10 season, months before becoming completely unglued.

""I had achieved my goal,"" he recalls on screen. ""But I hated myself.""

Clune eventually checked into rehab a second time — he went once before, but didn't stay — and committed to getting better with a lot of help from the people around him.

After he got out, he resumed his career and went onto play a total of 120 regular-season games in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Nashville Predators. His contract was bought out in 2015, and he was again at a crossroads — retire or keep going.

That's when the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were in the early stages of their massive rebuild, came calling to see if Clune wanted to be part of their program. They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club. At the very least, he would play in the minors and help foster a new culture.

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, who was in charge of the minor-league Marlies at the time, saw something in Clune that could be useful.

""He provides a certain energy,"" Dubas said. ""He provides experience in his life that I thought brought a great spirit to our team.""

Clune played 19 games with Leafs, but the forward truly made his mark with the Marlies. He helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018 and plans to continue his on-ice career, but equally important was how he's helped mentor a number of current NHLers.

He's proud of where he is, and not shy talking about how he got there. Clune still goes to meetings, does the 12 steps and now works to help others.

He also thinks a lot about why he made the decision to live, to fight, and get better, when many others — including some fellow pro hockey players — have gone down a different path.

""In the beginning, it was because I wanted to see my brothers,"" said Clune, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Then it transformed into wanting to live for myself. I started to discover what it feels like to have self esteem and to have love.

""I just hope people realize that they're not alone with how they feel. Don't be afraid to ask for help.""

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

article continues below

""After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,"" Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal's three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first overall by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

""A low-maintenance superstar,"" said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg's senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At five foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn't blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack of getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday. ""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League. I think it was Dale's arrival that really cemented the future of the franchise and I think we all have recollections of that first year, that Calder (Trophy) year and then everything that would follow.

""He was truly a superstar as a hockey player, but I think why he was so loved here was not just that but largely the fact that he made this his home and became one of us. I think everybody shared that sense of pride in Dale's career as a player.""

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: ""All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL's all time greatest players.""

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

""What an incredible human being,"" Selanne tweeted.

Montreal Canadiens associate coach Kirk Muller also had a chance to speak with Hawerchuk in recent days.

""I talked to Dale a few days ago, and we had a good chance to chat. A good friend, had a real good opportunity to play against one of the all-time best players. As a hockey player, we all know how great he was, but he was a good friend and just a really special person, did a lot for charities. It's a real loss for us in the hockey world.""

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk ""one of the most decorated players in our game's history.""

In September 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

""For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I'm ready to fight it,"" he told TSN in October 2019. ""I want to live to tell the story.""

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie's bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames players Andrew Mangiapane and Rasmus Andersson remembered playing for Hawerchuk in Barrie.

""I don't know where I'd be without him,"" said Mangiapane. ""Very sad news today. I owe my career basically to him and the whole Barrie organization.""

Andersson, from Sweden, said ""Dale was a fantastic human being. Such a great person. My first week in Barrie he invited us over to his house and really just welcomed me to Canada. I cannot say enough good things about him as a person. Obviously a real good coach, too.""

""It's awful news.""

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday's opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at age two and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur's record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

""I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive — well maybe a little further now with the traffic,"" he said. ""I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""

""I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,"" he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and '81 with teammates that included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL's top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt like he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year — the youngest recipient at the time — and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

""Just one of the greatest. You could tell from day one. We knew from when he was 18 years old as a player that he would turn the (Jets) franchise around. Certainly one of the best I’ve ever played with and coached,"" said Dallas Stars coach Rick Bowness, who played with and coached Hawerchuk in the '80s.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

""He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,"" said Mike Doran, Winnipeg's director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the faceoff in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux's famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

""It turned out fantastic,"" said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada's call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets ""are etched in my mind every day that I live.""

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes' ring of honour.

Hawerchuk re-wrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia whom he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

""It's like going back down memory lane,"" he said in his induction speech.

""All the experiences have been fantastic,"" he added. ""I mean, sometimes they didn't feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing ... Even though I didn't win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn't change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.""

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets' Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November 2017.

""Tonight we fly Ducky's number high,"" said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue's ""Home Sweet Home,"" before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

""Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,"" said the PA announcer.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

""I've been to every part of (Manitoba), either golfing or playing (softball),"" Hawerchuk said. ""I've gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I'm honoured and I'm very humbled.""

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.

And that includes how to allow players under contract to CFL teams the ability to sign elsewhere — most notably the NFL — if the opportunity arises. On Monday, the CFL cancelled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The focus right now for us on a few certain things and one of them is ensuring if there's an ability for our players to receive some form of payment this year,"" Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA's executive director, said Monday during a conference call. ""They should be able to do that if they have an opportunity.""

While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season. However, 66 players have currently opted out of participating in the 2020 campaign, which could create opportunity for some CFL players to sign deals south of the border and have a chance to earn a football paycheque, either on the active roster or on the practice squad.

While there's no shortage of collegiate players available, the advantage a CFL player has is pro experience, a fact not lost upon NFL personnel people.

The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign. This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.

And players on NFL practice rosters receive at least US$8,000 per week.

Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the CFL is amendable to doing what it can to help its players.

""Where we can do something we will,"" he said. ""We're going to be committed to working towards good outcomes, the best possible outcomes we can have with out players.

""That's not going to mean we're going to be able to do everything but we're certainly going to go into this with a real positive spirit.""

Something else that will be on the CFL-CFLPA radar will be the current collective bargaining agreement, which is slated to expire after the 2021 season. But union president Solomon Elimimian said the two sides covered a lot of ground this time around during talks to amend the agreement for a shortened '20 season.

""Whether we deal with '21 when it comes or after the '21 season I think there's hope there that we can work together,"" Elimimian said. ""Obviously the relationship between the players and the league needs to be one where the players feel appreciated.

""Everyone wants to the league to reach its full potential. The partnership has to be one that's very genuine and the players have to feel part of that. If that happens, the sky is the limit.""

Cavan Biggio also went deep for the Blue Jays and finished with three hits and three RBIs.

Ryu (2-1) struck out three and walked none. The left-hander permitted only one runner past second base and yielded just one extra-base hit to a team that came in ranked second in the majors with a .467 slugging percentage.

Rather than vie for strikeouts, Ryu said he was focused more on getting the Orioles to hit the ball weakly.

""I was able to keep them off balance,"" he said through an interpreter.

Signed in December to an $80 million, four-year contract, Ryu got off to a shaky start with Toronto in July before showing the form he displayed as a star with the Dodgers. He's given up a total of two runs in his last three starts after allowing eight runs over nine innings in his first two outings.

""That was vintage Ryu,"" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. ""Ryu was outstanding. That's the reason we won the game.""

The two home runs were a factor, but mostly Ryu was the difference-maker.

""They didn’t give Ryu that big contract for nothing,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""You just never know what he’s going to throw. You don’t know what side of the plate he’s going to throw to. He’s really tough on right-handers because he can locate it in. You saw a lot of us get jammed.""

The Blue Jays took control with a four-run third against Alex Cobb (1-2). Three infield hits produced a run before Grichuk delivered a three-run drive over the centre-field wall. It was his third home run of the season, all in the last four games.

""Obviously, the pitch to Grichuk was middle middle and it was a poorly executed pitch,"" Cobb said. ""But most of the pitches that I had, I felt like I executed. I got the results.""

Cobb gave up five runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He’s winless in his last four starts.

After hitting 31 homers last year, Grichuk was batting fifth, sixth or seventh in the order this season before Montoyo decided to move him into the No. 2 spot Sunday to replace injured Bo Bichette. Over the past two games, Grichuk has two homers, four hits and six RBIs.

Pedro Severino and Renato Núñez had RBIs for the Orioles, who have dropped two straight after winning seven of eight.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Bichette (right knee sprain) had an MRI and will receive a second opinion on his injury, Montoyo said. Bichette leads Toronto with a .361 batting average.

Orioles: RH Dillon Tate (elbow contusion) came off the injured list and RH Evan Phillips was optioned to the team's alternate site.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: RH Nate Pearson (0-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his fourth start in his first big league season Tuesday night. Drafted 28th overall in 2017, the 23-year-old is looking to rebound after giving up four runs to Miami last week in 2 1/3 innings. ""I'm developing at the highest level,"" Pearson said Monday. ""When I don't have my best stuff, I'm going to struggle.""

Orioles: LH Wade LeBlanc (1-0, 7.13) has allowed a combined 10 runs over 12 innings in his last three starts.

DeBrusk scored twice while the Bruins scored four straight goals to rally and beat the Hurricanes 4-3 on Monday to take a 3-1 lead in their first-round playoff series.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

""We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,"" Marchand said. ""That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.""

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

""We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do — little battles,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.""

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President's Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk's first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy's hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina's captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy putaway from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston's first six post-season games.

""There's other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.""

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen's late goal.

""That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,"" Williams said. ""We got it handed to us.""

NOTES: David Pastrnak had a goal and an assist in Boston’s double-overtime win in Game 1, but hasn’t played since. He had 48 regular-season goals to tie Washington’s Alex Ovechkin for the league lead. … Carolina played without 20-year-old Andrei Svechnikov, who was injured when his leg twisted awkwardly beneath him late in the third period of Saturday's loss. ... DeBrusk scored his 12th and 13th playoff goals since his 2018 post-season debut. … The Hurricanes were also without D Joel Edmundson for the third straight game. … Jake Gardiner assisted on Williams’ first-period goal for his first post-season point with Carolina.

These cats are hanging around here, and then the little horse was killed and pets are missing.","A rural community near Qualicum Beach is living in fear for their pets and small children after a cougar killed a miniature pony in its pen last week.

At least two cougars have been hanging around the Corcan Meadowood area for the past two weeks, said a member of the resident’s association, who said the big cats are showing “stalking behaviour.”

“We have a large number of families and a lot of younger kids in our area, so these cougars are definitely a concern,” said Chris Burger, who runs a general store at the centre of the rural community of about 700 houses about 15 minutes north of Qualicum Beach.

“Our kids play in the forest. They don’t have a playground like in the cities. They’re on the trails and in the woods — that’s life in a rural area.”

Dan Eichstadter of the B.C. Conservation Officers Service said the small pony was killed inside its pen by a cougar on Saturday. The attack was considered bold and unusual because the small horse was killed in its paddock in close proximity to a family’s home.

“For a cougar to kill an animal that is contained [in a pen], that’s elevated behaviour,” Eichstadter said. “The husbandry practices of securing animals are there to protect them.”

He said conservation officers have stepped up patrols after several sightings in the area.

“We are seeing increases in sightings and [the cougars] are being more active on the fringe hours of dusk and dawn seeking protein.”

Eichstadter said cougars normally prey on deer, raccoons and rabbits, but could be looking at pets such as cats and dogs.

It was unclear if the two cougars are a mother and older cub as some in the community have suggested. Residents say the cougars don’t appear to be hiding and look quite calm around people.

The Conservation Officers Service said that is not normal behaviour for a cougar.

Burger’s store is a gathering place where residents drop in and share information, and the rural area of about 2,000 has been abuzz with talk of the cougars. He said people in the community have reported three missing cats over the past two weeks.

“I get calls from people continuously saying they saw a cougar in their backyard or on a street,” he said, noting that a cougar was seen watching the fifth-wheel trailer his mother lives in from a few metres away.

“We’re teaching our kids to make sure they understand what to do if you see one or come close to one — don’t run, back away slowly.”

Berger said residents are used to living in a rural, forested area with corridors where wildlife travels frequently. “But this is different. These cats are hanging around here, and then the little horse was killed and pets are missing. People are very concerned.”

Conservation officers are asking people to call the provincial Report All Poachers and Polluters line at 1-877-952-7277 (RAPP) to report any sightings.

Walker said the woman, who is in her early 20s, fell to the ground. She told Walker the man said he would hurt her if she moved or called the police.

The man took the day’s pay envelope and fled eastbound on Belleville Street on a light-coloured road bike, said Victoria police spokesman Bowen Osoko.

Police looked for the man but were unable to find him. He is described as white and in his mid-30s, with a long, full beard. He was wearing a black and red ball cap, a dark-coloured hoodie and jeans.

Walker said the man had been hanging around the carriage booth, talking to carriage operators and customers and acting very “jolly.”

The woman told Walker that she’s trained in martial arts but she didn’t want to fight back because she couldn’t see if the man had a weapon.

“I said money isn’t everything. We can replace the money, we cannot replace you,” Walker said. He didn’t want to say how much was stolen, but said it’s a significant amount considering how much tourism operators are struggling amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The BC Wildfire Service said crews are responding to the fire on Christie Mountain about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, on the east side of Skaha Lake.

The fire is estimated at 250 hectares and firefighters on the ground are being supported by air tankers.

The service said the situation was ""rapidly evolving"" and asked everyone to stay clear of the area to avoid interfering with the operation.

The order asks residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with pets and critical items.

""We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,"" the service said in a tweet.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a ""fire of note"" on Tuesday.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was smouldering with no open flame but was considered out of control. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight.

Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Firefighters have tackled dozens of wildfires after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions.

Two fires were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada has estimated returning sockeye would hit a record low this year, with about 283,000 fish or fewer making it from the ocean to their Fraser River spawning grounds.

Just last month, the department estimated 941,000 sockeye would return, though it noted salmon forecasts were highly uncertain, in part because of a lack of understanding of the effects of warming ocean waters.

The council, made up of the B.C. Assembly of First Nations, the First Nations Summit and Union of B.C. Indian chiefs, says Indigenous communities that rely on the salmon for food face the greatest impacts, but the department has consistently prioritized commercial fishing.

Representatives with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans were not immediately available for comment.

First Nations fishing rights are protected by the Constitution and the council says the federal government has failed in its duty to ensure they have priority access to salmon.

Robert Phillips with the First Nations Summit says Indigenous leaders have been calling on Ottawa to save the salmon for decades and it's time for full jurisdiction over salmon stocks to be transferred back to First Nations.

Five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations on Vancouver Island have also accused federal fisheries officials of systemic racism after the government decided to exclude them in the allocation of 15,000 extra salmon this year — a surplus that arose because fewer people were fishing recreationally during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Salmon returning to the Fraser River also face the added hurdle of making it over a massive landslide along a remote stretch of the river north of Lillooet.

A pneumatic pump and tube system and the construction of a fish ladder have been installed to help salmon over the five-metre waterfall created by the slide.

In an update last week, Fisheries and Oceans said water levels have dropped sufficiently in recent days to allow fish to pass over the slide on their own steam.

A Department of Fisheries document from 2017 says total adult returns of Fraser River sockeye are highly variable ranging from 2 to 28 million, with an average of 9.6 million, between 1980 and 2014.

The Nisga'a Lisims government said Tuesday that Gosnell died in his home in New Aiyansh after a long battle with cancer.

Gosnell was a hereditary Nisga'a chieftain of the Eagle Clan and was president of the nation when it finalized a landmark treaty in 2000 that gave the First Nation control over its land including forestry and fishing rights. It was the first modern-day treaty signed in B.C. since the 1800s.

Nisga'a Nation president Eva Clayton said Gosnell's wisdom, dignity and determination helped lead the First Nation into self-government over its territory northeast of Prince Rupert.

""Today, we have lost a giant,"" Clayton said in a statement. ""His legacy will help shape the project of reconciliation for generations to come.""

Gosnell was a recipient of the Order of Canada, the Order of B.C. and held an honorary doctorate of laws from Royal Roads University in Victoria.

He is survived by his wife of 64 years, Audrey, their seven children and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Gosnell grew up in the Nass River Valley in B.C.'s northwest. He worked as a commercial fisherman, carpenter and traditional carver before he was elected as a band councillor and chief of the Gitlaxt'aamiks Band, one of the Nisga'a village governments.

Gosnell was appointed chancellor of the University of Northern B.C. last year and served until his death.

University interim president Geoffrey Payne said Gosnell's dedication to education was evident during his time as chancellor.

""The world has lost a tremendous leader, a man who repeatedly demonstrated a love for his community, his people, education and a commitment to enhancing the lives of others,"" Payne said in a statement.

Clayton said Gosnell's work to negotiate the Nisga'a Treaty produced a ""beacon of hope"" for people around the world.

""His focus was always on what the Nisga'a, British Columbians and Canadians can achieve together,"" she said.

When a bill to accept the treaty was introduced in the legislature in December 1998, Gosnell told the house the agreement proved to the world that reasonable people can sit down and settle historical wrongs.

""It's a triumph because under the treaty, we will no longer be wards of the state, no longer beggars in our own land. It's a triumph because under the treaty, we will collectively own approximately 2,000 square kilometres of land, far exceeding the postage-stamp reserve set aside for us by colonial governments.""

He said the treaty proved that negotiations — not lawsuits, blockades or violence — are the most effective and honourable way to resolve Aboriginal issues.

""It's a triumph, I believe, that signals the end of the Indian Act, the end of more than a century of humiliation, degradation and despair for the Nisga'a Nation.""

Premier John Horgan said in a tweet that everyone can learn from Gosnell's legacy of working to make life better for people and he'll be missed.

""He was instrumental in helping the Nisga'a chart a new path of self-governance through BC's first modern treaty.""

The nation said funeral arrangements will be announced by the family.

John McCain of Arizona.

She’s just the latest Republican to join in the convention, after a number of notable GOP former elected officials — including former Ohio Gov. John Kasich — endorsed the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee on Monday night. It's a continuation of a major theme that Democrats have pushed through the first night of the convention — an effort to broaden the party's appeal to occasional Republicans and disaffected Trump voters.

In an advance clip from the video shared with The Associated Press, Cindy McCain talks about how Biden, then a Delaware senator, met her husband when John McCain was assigned to be a military aide for him on a trip overseas. The two became friends, and the families would gather for picnics in the Bidens’ backyard.

""They would just sit and joke. It was like a comedy show, sometimes, to watch the two of them,"" she says in the clip.

Cindy McCain is not expected to offer an explicit endorsement, but her involvement in the video is her biggest public show of support yet for Biden’s candidacy. McCain was the 2008 Republican presidential nominee against Democrat Barack Obama, who won the election with Biden as his vice-presidential running mate.

Both Cindy McCain and her daughter Meghan have been outspoken critics of President Donald Trump, and the family is longtime friends with the Bidens. Trump targeted John McCain personally in 2015, saying the former prisoner of war wasn't a hero ""because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured."" McCain later angered Trump with his dramatic thumbs-down vote against repealing President Barack Obama’s health care law.

When McCain died on a Saturday in 2018, the Trump administration lowered the American flag over the White House to half-staff but then raised it by Monday. After public outcry, the White House flags were again lowered. Trump wasn't invite to McCain's funeral.

Biden consoled Meghan McCain on an appearance on ""The View"" after her father was diagnosed with the cancer that eventually took his life. She has said Biden often reaches out to her to offer support, after losing his own son Beau to the same cancer in 2015.

But while Meghan suggested in April she’d be voting for Biden, Cindy has pointedly stayed out of the presidential race. In April of last year, amid rumours that the McCains would wade into the election in support of Biden, Cindy McCain tweeted that Biden is ""a wonderful man and a dear friend of the McCain family.""

""However,"" she added at the time, ""I have no intention of getting involved in presidential politics.""

The video on Biden's friendship with McCain is one of a series of short documentaries created by Oscar Award-winning director Davis Guggenheim, who worked on ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" the 2006 documentary on climate change that featured former Vice-President Al Gore. On Monday night, Guggenheim’s short film focused on Biden’s relationship with the Amtrak conductor and workers on the trains he took from Delaware to Washington as senator aired during the convention."

Jenkins said he decided against sending students home after consulting with the St. Joseph County Health Department. Instead, university officials decided steps could be taken short of closing the campus while still protecting students' health and safety.

The university is advising off-campus students not to visit the campus and on-campus students not to venture off-campus and is restricting student gatherings to 10 people or less. The university is allowing graduate student access to research laboratories and libraries. Athletic teams subject to surveillance testing can continue to gather for sanctioned activities, but will be closely monitored.

""The virus is a formidable foe,"" Jenkins said in announcing enhanced testing for students experiencing symptoms and surveillance testing for those without symptoms. ""For the past week, it has been winning. Let us as the Fighting Irish join together to contain it.""

According to Jenkins, the university has traced the spike in COVID-19 cases to off-campus gatherings where neither masks were worn nor physical distancing observed. He said students infected at those gatherings passed it on to others, who in turn passed the virus on to others, resulting in the positive cases, with all but one a student.

Jenkins asked students to help in identifying others who have been flagrantly violating safety protocols.

The action by Notre Dame follows the decision by officials of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to switch to remote learning starting Wednesday, and is making arrangements for students who want to leave campus housing. UNC officials said clusters of COVID-19 were discovered in dorms, a fraternity house and other student housing.

Coronavirus outbreaks earlier this summer at fraternities in Washington state, California and Mississippi provided a glimpse of the challenges school officials face in keeping the virus from spreading on campuses where young people gather in close quarters.

The virus has been blamed for over 170,000 deaths and 5.4 million confirmed infections in the U.S."

As Democrats gathered virtually, Trump targeted voters in a pair of key swing states and sought to curry favour with women voters by pardoning Susan B. Anthony, a leader in the women’s suffrage movement.

In Arizona, one of the top 2020 battleground states, the president sought to paint a Biden victory in apocalyptic terms, insisting ""the survival of our nation is at stake"" in November, as he slammed what he hyperbolically labeled the ""insane and lethal policies"" of his opposition.

""Biden’s plan is the most radical, extreme, reckless, dangerous and deadly immigration plan ever put forward by a major party candidate,"" he said. ""It must be defeated. and it will be defeated on November 3.""

Trump repeatedly mischaracterized Biden’s views on immigration, which are more centrist than many others in his party. Biden, for instance, does not support abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and he argues that crossing the U.S. border illegally should be criminally prosecuted rather than made a civil offence, as many other top Democratic presidential hopefuls proposed.

With his second campaign trip in two days, Trump was hoping to halt an expected convention polling bump for his rival and shore up support with his focus on immigration, one of the most important issues to his political base. He was also trying to stanch an erosion in support among female voters with a symbolic nod on the centennial of the ratification of the 19th Amendment.

In recent weeks, Trump has been trying to build support within the pivotal female voter constituency and has stepped up his events aimed at women. His campaign has launched another ""women for Trump"" bus tour, and the president has embraced a ""law and order"" message with renewed vigour.

The president also worked in a last-minute stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, for a briefing about damage from the derecho last week that has left thousands without power and caused catastrophic damage across the battleground state. Many there have expressed outrage that their plight has not received more national attention.

The storm, which packed 100 mph winds and similar power to an inland hurricane, blew down trees, flipped vehicles and caused widespread damage.

""We’ve come through for you, and we will always come through for Iowa,"" Trump said, as the city's mayor urged him to consider enhanced federal disaster funding for people there.

Trump highlighted his immigration agenda during his stop in Yuma, and got an update on construction of his southern border wall. The president insisted that, in addition to fulfilling his pledge to build the wall, Mexico was also paying for it — even though they’re not.

""They are paying for it,"" he said as he stood in front of a replica of his wall, telling reporters he’s planning to enact a border crossing toll at some point in the future.

""Mexico will be paying,"" he said. ""We’re figuring how much we have to charge.""

Before leaving Washington, Trump held a White House event to announce the pardon of Anthony, convicted of voting in 1872 in violation of laws permitting only men to vote. But he quickly pivoted to the upcoming election and the issue of voting by mail.

""Win, lose or draw, we have to get it right,"" Trump said of the November vote count, levelling a fresh offensive against mail-in voting.

""You can’t have millions and millions of ballots sent all over the place, sent to people that are dead, sent to dogs, cats, sent everywhere,"" Trump said.

In fact, voter fraud has proved exceedingly rare. The Brennan Center for Justice in 2017 ranked the risk of ballot fraud at 0.00004% to 0.0009%, based on studies of past elections.

Only nine states have plans for ""universal"" mail-in voting, in which ballots are sent automatically to registered voters. Five of those states relied on mail-in ballots even before the coronavirus pandemic raised concerns about voting in person.

Trump's pardon announcement came on the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which ensured women the right to vote. The amendment states, ""The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex."" Congress passed it in 1919, and the amendment was ratified on Aug. 18, 1920.

Anthony was arrested for voting in Rochester, New York, and convicted in a widely publicized trial. Although she refused to pay the fine, the authorities declined to take further action.

""She felt the trial was the greatest miscarriage of justice because she had not had an opportunity to have a jury of her peers, and the jury didn’t get to vote,"" according to Deborah L. Hughes, president and CEO of The National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House in Rochester, where Anthony died in 1906.

""So to pardon her is to validate the trial, and she would not buy that idea at all,"" Hughes said.

Hughes said the question to ask on the anniversary is how she would want to be honoured. ""She would be the first to say if any president wanted to honour her, the best way to do that is to make sure there is no voter suppression anywhere in the United States,"" Hughes said.

Preparations for Trump's own acceptance speech next week were under way at the White House, where a stage was being erected on the South Lawn.

As was the case Monday in Minnesota and Wisconsin, Trump did not venture beyond the airports in Iowa or Arizona — a reflection of the new realities of campaigning in the midst of a pandemic. But Trump's Yuma rally felt much like his rallies of old, with a tightly packed crowd of hundreds shouting and cheering — though many were wearing ""TRUMP"" and ""MAGA"" masks.

The credit reporting agency said in a quarterly report that credit card balances fell 12.3 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period a year ago.

Reduced opportunities for spending during the lockdown may have contributed to the drop, said TransUnion's Matt Fabian, but he also noted that people are dipping into savings or retirement funds rather than relying on credit cards.

""Recent feedback from our survey seems like the folks that say they're still experiencing a lot of financial hardship continues to drop. And there's a lot more certainty in terms of the response, in terms of what they're going to do. Consumers have fortified themselves,"" said Fabian.

TransUnion uses the credit bureaus' national consumer credit database as source material for its quarterly report.

Applications for new credit also grew at a slower-than-usual pace amid reduced access to branches during the lockdown, uncertainty around employment and a pullback on new offers from lenders.

The report did note that credit balances for Millennials and Gen Z consumers grew 0.8 per cent and 5.9 per cent, respectively, as those consumers have less buffer in the form of savings, investments or retirement funds. Overall instalment loan debt also rose by 3.9 per cent in the second quarter to $175.4 billion, up from $168.8 billion a year ago.

Mortgage debt is on the rise, TransUnion said, with new mortgages, renewals and refinances up 29 per cent from a year ago and a 5.3 per cent annual increase in the total volume of mortgage debt.

""The spring, that's usually the big mortgage season or the big home buying season. With people not being able to go out, and constraints around travelling and visiting homes and looking at new homes, once some of those lock downs were lifted, we've seen sort of a real surge,"" Fabian said.

""Certainly for some consumers that have existing mortgages, deferrals were an option, and a lot of consumers opted to take it … certainly for a lot of people, a mortgage might be one of the biggest monthly or biweekly expenses that they'd have.""

Despite a 4.3 per cent rise in total outstanding debt in Canada, which stood at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter, Fabian says delinquencies have risen less than expected, as about 2.6 million Canadians, or 9.2 per cent of credit consumers, have at least one active deferral.

Delinquencies also were on the rise for personal loans, which TransUnion noted are ""partly fuelled by alternative lenders who have been slightly more aggressive in issuing personal loans to below prime consumers.""

""We have seen delinquency rates go up a little bit, but a lot less than we had expected… and I think part of that is the deferral and forbearance processes that are in place with the lenders as well as the support from the government,"" said Fabian.

""Delinquency tends to be a long-tail thing where it takes a while. People have exhaust all their options before they will start to continuously skip and miss payments. As deferrals come off and the government subsidization ends, we expect to see some delinquency spike.""

Chrystia Freeland, who was sworn in Tuesday afternoon after Bill Morneau resigned late Monday, will have to manage a COVID-19 recovery that is still very much under way, with more than 40 per cent of the three million workers who lost jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic still unemployed as of mid-July.

The path forward for jobless Canadians is still taking shape. Fewer than one-third of the 4.7 million people who were receiving the $2,000-per-month Canada Emergency Response Benefit at the beginning of August would qualify for Employment Insurance when CERB ends on Sept. 26, according to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, though the government has promised to ease EI eligibility rules.

The unemployment rate currently sits at 10.9 per cent, according to Statistics Canada's July labour force survey, which noted almost twice as many people were unemployed than in February.

Meanwhile, the spectre of protectionism continues to loom large after U.S. President Donald Trump reimposed tariffs on Canadian aluminum earlier this month — Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden also harbours protectionist sentiments — further complicating trade relationships.

Key to the task of drafting a budget will be weighing whether to patch up a frayed social safety net or to broaden it with reinforced rope.

""There are huge challenges in terms of how our social safety net has actually been exposed through COVID to be kind of thin and narrow,"" said Sheila Block, a senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.

""Years and years of underinvestment in public services have really come back to bite us.""

Potential changes to employment insurance — thresholds for hours worked, payment amounts and inclusion of self-employed and gig economy workers — fall under the purview of the employment minister, ""but eventually it lands on the finance minister,"" Block said.

Debt presents another dilemma for Freeland. Ottawa has been pumping money into the economy since March, resulting in a projected debt of $343 billion, an increase of more than 1,000 per cent from the previous year.

Much of that spending has gone toward a federal wage subsidy for troubled businesses, which has been extended until at least December. Further extensions and tweaks to the program — it will cost the government an estimated $67.9 billion through the end of the year, according to a report last week by the Parliamentary Budget Office — will rest largely in Freeland's hands.

Fiscal policy is already running ""at full throttle,"" said Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter, with the 2020-21 federal debt-to-GDP ratio headed about 49 per cent compared to 31 per cent currently.

The longer-term issue is whether the surge in spending linked to the coronavirus will morph into a more permanent trend, with attendant tax and debt implications, he said.

Despite a drastic uptick, the debt-to-GDP ratio remains well below danger zones highlighted by the International Monetary Fund and the highs of the mid-1990s, when it reached two-thirds.

Interest rates are also at historic lows, which means the borrowed cash comes cheap.

Morneau's resignation could portend a doubling down on a ""'fairness' agenda,"" with ""more fiscal activism"" the likely outcome, said Derek Holt, vice-president at Scotiabank Economics.

""The timing works well, as resigning in August gives plenty of time for a material shift in the fiscal stance before the unconfirmed fall budget or update and Throne Speech,"" Holt said in a research note.

The Business Council of Canada on Tuesday urged the government to set clear fiscal targets and rein in spending given a projected net debt in 2020-21 of $1.2 trillion, saying in a letter to Freeland that ""interest rates will rise eventually.""

CEO Goldy Hyder said there is an ""urgent need"" for Ottawa to pivot to an ""economic growth and prosperity agenda,"" with an eye to structural issues ranging from an aging population and climate change to ""regulatory obstacles that go well beyond pipelines.""

Freeland brings to the table a background steeped in financial journalism — she penned the 2012 book ""Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else"" — and delicate trade negotiations with the U.S. during her nearly two-year stint as foreign affairs minister.

""Her communication skills and prior background as a financial journalist and policy wonk will serve her well in the role as will her global mindset. Freeland could well be the country’s best — if not only — chance at a female prime minister within a reasonable time horizon,"" Holt said.

Some previous finance ministers have landed in the role after prominent business careers, including Morneau and Paul Martin, but others such as Jean Chretien, Jim Flaherty and John Manley took on the title without any executive experience.

""Being a titan of industry in particular in these times is not necessarily the best qualification for a finance minister,"" Block said, citing inequality and the pandemic as the towering economic issues of the day.

""I think there’s a great deal of uncertainty, and that’s something that the finance minister will also have to deal with.""

In documents filed by her court-appointed lawyer that give a rare public airing to the wishes of the 38-year-old pop superstar, she asked that her father not return to the role of conservator of her person, which gave him power over her major life decisions from 2008 until 2019, when he temporarily stepped aside, citing health problems.

article continues below

""Britney is strongly opposed to James return as conservator of her person,"" the document says.

James Spears has kept his separate role as conservator over his daughter's finances. For the first 11 years of the conservatorship, he served as co-conservator with attorney Andrew M. Wallet, who resigned from the role early last year.

That briefly left James Spears with sole power over Britney Spears' life, money and career, a situation she says she very much wants to avoid repeating.

An email seeking comment from James Spears' attorney was not immediately returned.

Spears says she wants Jodi Montgomery, who has been serving as conservator of her person temporarily, to do so permanently, but she says that doesn't mean she is waiving her right to seek an end to the entire arrangement.

The documents also reveal that Britney Spears has no plans to perform again anytime soon. She last performed live in October 2018, and early in 2019, cancelled a planned Las Vegas residency.

The filing gave a rare glimpse at Britney Spears' own wishes in the conservatorship that has had vast power over her for over a decade. She has almost never spoken publicly about the matter, and court hearings and documents in the case are cloaked in secrecy, though last year she addressed the court at her request, suggesting she was seeking changes.

In the papers, Britney Spears praises the conservatorship and its work overall, saying it ""rescued her from a collapse, exploitation by predatory individuals and financial ruin"" and that it made her ""able to regain her position as a world class entertainer.""

The document was filed a day before a status hearing on the conservatorship, expected to be closed to the media and public.

Britney Spears' attorney said that he expects James Spears will aggressively contest being marginalized, and said that Britney Spears has suggested they retain a lawyer with expertise in complex financial court fights.

The conservatorship, known in some states as a guardianship, gave James Spears power over his daughter's career choices and much of her personal life, including her relationship with her teenage sons. Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline has custody of the boys, but she has frequent visits with them.

When you are The Killers and your usual guitarist has gone, no problem. When you’re The Killers you can turn to Lindsey Buckingham.

article continues below

The former Fleetwood Mac guitarist steps in for a tune on the new 10-song ""Imploding the Mirage,"" another sign of the band’s clout. The album's guests also include k.d. lang and Adam Granduciel of The War on Drugs.

The absence of guitarist and co-founder Dave Keuning is felt, with keyboards and drums stepping into the void. Without Keuning’s jangle and riff shards, The Killers have a more poppy sound.

If 2017's ""Wonderful Wonderful"" was a meditation on the anxiety of masculinity, the new album often explores the lives of women, with two sharp portraits of tough survivors in ""Blowback"" and ""Caution"" — women whom Brandon Flowers sings each come from ""white trash.""

Many other songs are about loyally backing a partner. ""I’ll be there when water’s rising/I’ll be your lifeguard,"" Flowers sings on ""Dying Breed."" On ""When the Dreams Run Dry,"" he vows: ""I’ll be on your side/When the dreams run dry."" In ""Lightening Fields,"" he sings, ""Just wanted to run my fastest/And stand beside you."" The cover of the album depicts a god tenderly supporting a goddess.

Jonathan Rado of California psychedelic-rock duo Foxygen and Shawn Everett — who worked on ""Wonderful Wonderful"" as well as with Kacey Musgraves and Alabama Shakes — have stepped in to produce and their influence can best be heard on the funky ""Fire in Bone.""

Elsewhere, listeners may have fun finding the band's other influences. There's a Tom Petty-ish sound to ""Blowback"" and ""My Own Soul's Warning"" has a Springsteen vibe. But there's no mistaking that classic Killers mix of soaring vocals, sonic bombast and sly humour in such songs as ""My God"" and the title track. It's a solid album from a band still exploring.

""This is me. I am 'Pipe Nation,'"" she said with a laugh Monday during an interview with The Canadian Press in Sundre, Alta., a picturesque oil town nestled near the Rocky Mountains.

article continues below

""I've been working in the oil and gas industry for about six years. I took a break when the bust happened and did a little serving, a little bartending but always went back to the oil and gas,"" added Gamble, who is 24.

""My father, my grandfather and my great grandfather were all in the oil and gas industry as well.""

Sundre is set to become the fictional community of Hardwell. The drama will focus on day-to-day hardships labourers face, with Gamble's character as the leader of a pipe gang — workers who position and align the pipe, preparing it for the weld. In real life, Gamble has held a number of jobs in the industry including welding.

But this is her first acting part since middle school.

""I always wanted to become an actor because I always thought pretending to be someone and falling into a character is a lot of fun and being someone else,"" she said.

""Unfortunately that's not the direction I went to until now when I got handed this beautiful opportunity that my little-girl dream could come true.""

Filmmaker and director Raoul Bhatt says he wanted a mix of both professional and amateur actors on set, and he's not concerned about the lack of experience from some of his cast members. He sees it as an asset to the project.

""I needed this to be believable and I needed someone with a certain language, a certain grit, combined with people who have actor experience,"" said Bhatt, adding 480 people showed up for the casting call. ""I wanted someone who's believable, honest, sincere and lives in the moment.""

Bhatt, who grew up in Edmonton, has a soft spot for the energy sector and says the show is meant to spotlight the colourful nature of the individuals.

""They're just beautiful people and to showcase that beyond the Dow Jones, beyond just the oil and gas numbers to human struggle, conditions and overcoming adversity and the determination of these characters is what the show is about,"" he said.

Bhatt, a software engineer who self-funded the pilot, has worked as a cinematographer and producer for the Daytime Emmys, as well as with Universal Studios' ""Jurassic World"" and a number of music videos.

He understands there are plenty of people out there who are not fans of the oil and gas industry.

""We are leaning toward pro but again that's for the viewer to decide. If you're against the oil and gas industry that's your opinion but I really hope this creates an emotional connection with the characters.""

Filming of the pilot will be completed by the end of August. Bhatt said he is in negotiations with a couple of streaming services for a 10-episode season.

A storage lot for oilfield equipment in Sundre is one of the regular sets. In addition, a portion of farmland in Sundre has been cleared for the actual building of a mini pipeline to add to the realism of the show.

Bhatt isn't short on technical advisers. Gin Ford, who plays the character Dee, has been a pipeline welder for the past 10-plus years. She has no acting experience but intends to use the show as a vessel for female empowerment and women in the energy industry.

""I'm not here for fame or recognition. I am actually here to make a voice for women in trades. Here's the moment for me to be a voice,"" said Ford.

""I've been called the pipeline princess and it's like, you can roll onto site and right way it's 'this girl's out here to work?'"" she said.

""I definitely want to highlight you can look like you want and you can still work in a male-dominated industry. It doesn't matter if you've got the nails, the lashes, the hair or the Barbie image.""

Ford said the show is meant to be raw, but it's not reality TV or a documentary.

""I'm not going to lie. My mom's probably going to tell me to wash my mouth out with some soap,"" Ford said, noting her character is tough-talking, confident and keeps up with the guys.

Mike Vickers plays Ryan, an East Coaster who moved to Alberta to make his fortune in the oil industry. Art imitates life for Vickers who moved to Alberta from Cape Breton.

""When I read the script it was my life. I fell in love with this. It's going to really showcase that true oil and gas grit, the struggles we all face and how we overcome it together as a family,"" Vickers said.

""There's so much opportunity to better the image of this industry and it's how we all come together is how we're going to do this and tell this story.""

Filming in Sundre is expected to wrap up by Aug. 24 and will finish in Nisku, south of Edmonton, by the end of the month.

Neither Cassirer's heirs nor Spain's Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum dispute the painting's early history.
Both U.S. District Judge John Walter, in a 2019 ruling, and the appeals court in Tuesday's, criticized the baron and the Spanish foundation for not doing more to discover whether the painting was looted art.
Both courts also criticized Spain for not living up to what the courts called ""moral commitments"" to return Nazi-looted art.
But that is the state of the law,"" the appeals court said in its ruling.","LOS ANGELES — A U.S. appeals court has ruled that a Camille Pissarro painting a Jewish woman traded to the Nazis to escape the Holocaust in 1939 may remain the property of a Spanish museum that acquired it more than a half-century later.

The unanimous ruling issued Monday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest — but possibly not the last — in a case that has wound through the courts of Spain and the United States for 20 years.

article continues below

At stake is ""La Rue St. Honoré, effet de Soleil, Après-Midi, 1898,"" an oil-on-canvas work of a rain-swept Paris street that Pissarro painted as he gazed at the scene from his hotel window. Its value has been estimated at $30 million.

Lilly Cassirer’s father-in-law bought it directly from Pissarro’s art dealer and left it to her and her husband when he died. In 1939, she traded it to the Nazis in exchange for exit visas for herself, her husband and her grandson, who eventually settled in the U.S. Her great-grandson, David Cassirer of San Diego, has continued the litigation since his father's death.

Neither Cassirer's heirs nor Spain's Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum dispute the painting's early history.

What's at issue all these years later is whether Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza made any serious effort to determine the painting was looted art when he acquired it from a New York gallery owner for $275,000 in 1976.

Also whether Spanish curators did their due diligence in tracing its provenance when a Spanish non-profit foundation acquired it and hundreds of other paintings from the baron's collection in 1992 and created the Madrid museum that bears his name.

Lilly Cassirer’s heirs say she spent years trying to recover the painting before concluding it was lost and accepting $13,000 in reparations from the German government in 1958.

It wasn’t until 1999 that her grandson, Claude, who had vividly recalled seeing it hanging in the family's German home, discovered it in the Madrid museum. After Spain refused to hand it over, he sued.

Attorney Thaddeus Stauber, who has represented the museum since the case reached U.S. courts in 2005, hailed Monday's decision, noting that the painting was sold and resold to numerous legitimate and prominent collectors over the years before the baron obtained it, with none discovering it had been seized by the Nazis.

He said there also appeared to be no effort by Thyssen-Bornemisza or any other collector to hide it from the public.

""We've been transparent from the start of this case, and we're very pleased that there's been a trial now and it brings it to a conclusion, we trust,"" he said Tuesday.

He did say the Cassirer family may appeal to the full 9th Circuit or even the U.S. Supreme Court.

The family did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday, but the president of the Holocaust Survivors Foundation USA denounced the decision.

""The Nazis murdered more than 6 million Jews, including 1.5 million children under the age of 12, and including 105 members of my family,"" David Schaecter said. ""How on God’s Earth can Spain fight so hard to deny a Jewish family its precious legacy that was looted by the Nazis? And how on God’s Earth can an American court ignore the unprecedented trauma of the Holocaust and reward Spain for its greed?""

Both U.S. District Judge John Walter, in a 2019 ruling, and the appeals court in Tuesday's, criticized the baron and the Spanish foundation for not doing more to discover whether the painting was looted art. But both courts concluded there was no proof either deliberately hid that it was.

Both courts also criticized Spain for not living up to what the courts called ""moral commitments"" to return Nazi-looted art.

""It is perhaps unfortunate that a country and a government can preen as moralistic in its declarations, yet not be bound by those declarations. But that is the state of the law,"" the appeals court said in its ruling."

""Find out more about what your school district is doing, and then adjust according to that.","TORONTO — Vonny Sweetland has yet to decide if he will be sending his 12-year-old sister Josephine back to class in September, but just in case he does, he's been stocking up on supplies for months.

He picks up hand sanitizer when he sees it in stores, grabbed new masks last month, bought a fresh uniform and has been testing out Josephine's muscle power with some new lunch containers.

The new additions to her backpack and are all part of a wave of changes families — and their wallets — are being confronted with as they prepare for back to school, whether it's sourcing protective equipment or choosing a thermos their child can open unassisted.

""In a COVID-era, all of these things we take for granted or think are minuscule are actually really important,"" said Sweetland, who is his sister's guardian.

""These are things as simple as a teacher helping you unpack your lunch or zipping a zipper. To prevent potential spread, I don't think teachers are really going to be doing these things.""

The cost of so many new supplies can easily add up.

A Deloitte survey of 1,200 parents who have at least one child attending school in grades K-12 this fall found the average family will spend $102 on school supplies, $216 on clothing and accessories, $395 on computers and hardware, $316 on electronic gadgets and digital subscriptions.

The survey, which was conducted between May and July, found those families will allocate $61 on a new category: home or health supplies.

Even so, back-to-school shopping doesn't have to be more expensive than any other year, said Seung Hwan (Mark) Lee, an associate professor of retail management at Ryerson University.

He recommends shoppers compare prices and take advantage of sales.

Anne Marie Taber said she's noticed plenty of sales, though she hasn't sought them out when shopping with seven-year-old daughter Avery because she tries to minimize her time in stores and instead use online options with delivery to lessen her exposure to the virus.

She stocked up as soon as she could on Old Navy's uniform-style clothing because several sizes were out of stock and also grabbed Avery a new backpack.

On top of masks and hand sanitizers, they bought a wide-mouth water bottle without a straw to make cleaning easy, plastic Duo-Tangs that can be wiped down and a set of art supplies that Avery has been reminded not to share.

""This is extra stuff we haven't had to buy in the past but it's a small dollar to pay to make sure that that is just hers exclusively,"" Taber said.

Parents may also want to consider disposable cutlery, if they have children that bring lunches to school and are worried about germs spreading through anything reuseable, Lee said.

If your child is doing virtual classes, he suggests ensuring you have a reliable laptop or tablet with a webcam.

Those who want to go all out or are older and have specific needs for programs they are enrolled in, may need to think about microphones and speakers too.

Those supplies don't come cheap. However, the cost of those high-ticket items could be partially offset by a change he sees happening across universities and colleges during the pandemic.

""It's no longer really about carrying around the heavy textbooks,"" he said.

""Many professors aren't holding lengthy exams because the exams are becoming very difficult to monitor and you can't really get a proctor to look at how students are conducting their exams... so using test banks or textbooks no longer apply.""

If you're feeling anxious or stressed about back to school shopping and advertisements are making you feel you better get to a store soon, Lee says not worry.

""I would advise parents right now not to rush into getting supplies,"" he said.

""Find out more about what your school district is doing, and then adjust according to that. A deal can always be had.""

Each summer, the former U.S. president unveils a selection of his favourite songs of the season.

Most of the artists are household names, but Obama often leaves room to showcase a few lesser-known acts, much to their surprise.

Shauf says he learned about his placement when a listener tagged him on Instagram shortly after Obama revealed the playlist on social media.

""It's cool to think that Obama, or the Obamas together, have listened to my music,"" he said.

""It's a really nice feeling to think my music has gone that far.""

""Neon Skyline"" is a particularly Canadian song choice because its story unravels inside the Skyline Restaurant, a real-life diner in Toronto's Parkdale neighbourhood, where two friends agree to meet for a beer shortly before one runs into his ex.

Shauf, who was born in Regina, said he frequented the Skyline when he moved to Toronto several years back

""It became a really friendly place to hang out and the setting for my record,"" he said.

Shauf has been a critical favourite in Canada for years. He was nominated for multiple Juno Awards, and ""The Neon Skyline"" landed on the long list of Polaris Prize contenders for this year's best album.

Fellow Canadian artists Drake and PartyNextDoor also showed up on Obama's list.

Both of them shared billing on Popcaan's track ""Twist & Turn,"" while Drake was also featured for his part on Rihanna's megahit ""Work.""

PartyNextDoor, who is Mississauga, Ont.-raised rapper Jahron Brathwaite, made a second appearance for his solo effort ""PGT,"" taken from his 2020 album, ""Partymobile.""

Michelaine Lahaie, chair of the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for RCMP, says a video shows an RCMP officer opening the door of a moving police vehicle, which hits the man.

The officer and other Mounties then use force to arrest him while he's on the ground.

Lahaie says the man was then injured in an alleged assault by another detained man in a cell at the Kinngait RCMP detachment and had to be flown to Iqaluit for medical treatment.

She says the investigation is to determine whether the conduct of the Mounties, including use of force, was reasonable.

She says in a news release that the probe will be a Public Interest Investigation into the conduct of RCMP in Kinngait.

""The RCMP members' conduct will be assessed in accordance with relevant law and RCMP policy,"" reads the terms of reference of the investigation released Tuesday.

""Consideration will also be given as to whether racial bias and/or discrimination played a role in the man's arrest and subsequent treatment.""

Lahaie noted the review she has requested by the commission is separate from an investigation by the Ottawa Police Service at the request of the Mounties and an RCMP internal Code of Conduct review.

""I am concerned with the conduct of RCMP members involved in this serious incident and will monitor both the OPS (Ottawa police) investigation and the RCMP's Code of Conduct investigation,"" Lahaie said in a release.

""The CRCC's investigation will provide an added level of scrutiny to the incident, as it will additionally examine the circumstances that led to the man being placed in a cell at the RCMP detachment where another detainee assaulted him and he needed to be airlifted to Iqaluit for treatment.

""I am aware that there is historical distrust by Inuit toward the police and I am committed to increasing RCMP accountability.""

The day after the man's arrest Nunavut Justice Minister Jeannie Ehaloak said she was outraged.

""I have seen the video from Kinngait circulating on social media and am very concerned by the unnecessary force, the violence and the lack of respect I have seen,'' she said in a release at the time.

""Nunavummiut should not fear this kind of treatment and disregard for safety and basic rights.''

Ehaloak said she would formally request a review by the commission.

The gravitas of the moment was not lost on the former journalist and mother of three. After she spoke the English words of her oath of office, she paused to take a deep breath, before repeating the oath in French.

""It's about time,"" Freeland said later at a press conference on Parliament Hill.

She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.

Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.

But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.

""There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,"" said Turnbull. ""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.""

Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.

She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.

""We don't like their representative very much,"" he said of her in September 2018.

Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said ""Mama (does not equal) chopped liver."" On the back it said ""Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.""

When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.

And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.

""She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,"" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.

He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.

""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.

""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.

""I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,"" he said. ""And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.""

She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.

""What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,"" Kelly said on Twitter. ""This has been missing in the department for several years.""

MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.

While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.

Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.

Trudeau said Tuesday that she had been ""a key player in my government from day one.""

Here is what that means and what could come next.

Word — The term comes through Middle English and Old French from a Latin root, prorogare, to prolong.

article continues below

Effect — Prorogation essentially ends a session of Parliament, allowing for a new beginning with a speech from the throne.

Legislation — At one time, prorogation killed all legislation before Parliament, but rule changes now provide that most bills can be revived in the new session at the same stage they were at when the previous session ended.

Committees — Committees, including special and legislative committees, cease to exist. Membership on committees, except the membership of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, is terminated and all chairs and vice-chairs no longer hold these positions.

Documents — No document may be tabled until the first day of a new session.

Quote — ""Prorogation of a session brings to an end all proceedings before Parliament. With certain exceptions, unfinished business 'dies' on the Order Paper and must be started anew in a subsequent session."" — House of Commons Procedure and Practice, Third Edition, 2017.

Length — Prorogation can be as short as a few hours, or as long as several months. During this period, the House of Commons and Senate are shut down but the government remains in power and MPs remain MPs.

Frequency — Most Parliaments are prorogued at least once and often there are several prorogations and sessions in the life of a Parliament.

Authority — Prorogation is ordered by the Governor General on the advice of the prime minister. It is not covered by statute. Rather it is a personal legal power of the Governor General and by convention the prime minister has the right to provide advice. And by convention it's actually the prime minister's decision.

Granted — Prorogation is routinely granted. In December 2008, then-governor general Michaelle Jean took a few hours before granting prorogation, but that was a thorny case because opposition parties were threatening to defeat the government and install a coalition government shortly after an election.

Ceremony — At one time, prorogation was done in a formal ceremony in the Senate chamber, but that hasn't been used in decades. A simple proclamation signed by the Governor General does the trick today.

Liberal promise — In their 2015 election platform, the Liberals said Stephen Harper's Conservatives ""used prorogation to avoid difficult political circumstances. We will not.""

Limits — Governments can't use prorogation to shut down Parliament indefinitely. That would violate the constitutional requirement that Parliament meet at least once every 12 months. And without Parliament to approve a budget and spending estimates, the government would run out of money.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

The five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations are upset that Ottawa decided to give a surplus allocation of salmon — which arose this year due to reduced recreational fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic — to commercial fishers rather than to the First Nations.

Clifford Atleo, lead negotiator for one of the nations who is also called Wickaninnish, says he feels sports and commercial troll fishers are given more rights to fish in the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

He says the latest decision to shut First Nations fishers out of an opportunity to catch more chinook salmon this year shows systemic racism is ""alive and well"" within the federal fisheries department.

""We feel very strongly we're not being dealt with fairly, we know we're not being dealt with fairly,"" Atleo said.

""It's just another layer of disappointment on the part of how the government deals with us. The government doesn't realize that their attitude toward our people is dyed-in-the-wool ... And I think the government — sometimes they don't realize they're being racist. They've got age-old policies that have never changed.""

A 2018 B.C. Supreme Court ruling directed Ottawa to take a more ""generous approach"" to allocations of chinook salmon to the First Nations given the importance of this species to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people.

The ruling from B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Humphries noted that the government's salmon allocation policy at the time gave recreational fisherman priority to fish for chinook and soho salmon ahead of the First Nations and advised the fisheries minister to reassess this policy.

Despite this ruling and changes that have since placed the First Nations at a higher priority than sport fishers, the Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ehattesaht and Mowachaht/Muchalaht nations say their yearly fishing allocations have not increased.

This year, the five First Nations were told they could fish 7,724 chinook, which amounts to just 1.5 fish per person for the 5,000 members of their communities.

COVID-19 brought a new dynamic to the salmon allocations this year, as fewer sport fishers were able to come due to pandemic restrictions. This means the recreational fleet is expected to catch 15,000 less salmon than was forecasted for this year, according to figures provided by the department.

None of this surplus is going to the First Nations.

""As per approved management plans, the Area G (commercial) harvest is adjusted based on the projected recreational harvests which results in an increase of 15,000 for 2020,"" said department spokesperson Athina Vazeos.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan was unavailable for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Jennifer Kuss, noted the improvements made in giving the five nations a higher priority in the yearly salmon catch allocations, as directed by the courts.

""This change ensures that food, social, and ceremonial (fishing) continues to be prioritized first, and additionally prioritizes the Five Nations rights-based sale fishery over the recreational and commercial fishery,"" Kuss said in a statement.

The Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations argue Ottawa could have provided some of the unused catch from this year to their people to help them support their remote communities. But Atleo said fisheries officials would not even engage in discussions about it.

""The government is trying to say they consult with us, they negotiate with us. They create their fishing plans, put it on the table and it's like take or leave it,"" Atleo said.

""All we want to do is be part of the economy, part of looking after ourselves without depending on government. We don't think that's a lot to ask.""

NDP MP Gord Johns, whose riding takes in the West Coast fishing shores, said he finds it ""disgusting"" the Trudeau government has repeatedly highlighted its desire to restore the Crown's relationship with Indigenous Peoples but has still fought many legal battles with these nations over their fishing rights.

""Indigenous people in our communities rely on this fishery for their economy, for their food security, for their culture. It's part of their way of life. These are salt water people and they rely on the salmon and to be denied their right is shameful, it's disgusting that the government is taking this approach.""

The First Nations are calling on Ottawa to revisit its decision on the surplus salmon for this year to allow them a portion of the additional catch.

""The government has an opportunity to fix this with these (surplus salmon) to come with a fair opportunity to exercise their commitment, in the judge's words, for a generous allocation to the nations and to start moving forward with reconciliation,"" Johns said.

The minister's spokeswoman says Jordan takes any allegations of systemic racism ""very seriously"" and that Ottawa is working with the five nations on a reconciliation agreement on fisheries resources, which is intended to broaden their access in the area, Kuss said.

""The road to reconciliation is a long journey, and Canada is committed to moving forward together. The department has spoken with the five nations on the reallocation of (salmon catch) on multiple occasions and that open dialogue will continue.""

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

""It was nice to get on the board tonight,"" said O'Reilly.

""I haven't been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it's just one game. I've got to be consistent with it.""

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

""When we take care of the puck it's effective and it's hard on them,"" said O'Reilly.

""I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We've got to stick to our structure.""

Pietrangelo said they've been working on fixing the penalty kill.

""We've been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,"" he said.

""Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.""

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

""They're blocking a lot of shots, they're studying us. They kind of know what we're doing,"" said Miller.

He said they'll make adjustments but aren't going to go back to square one.

""We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,"" he said.

""It's not like we're getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They're a good team. We're a good team. It's going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.""

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O'Reilly, last year's Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play — the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O'Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O'Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler's stick and in.

O'Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

All Western Conference games are being played in front of no fans at Rogers Place. The players are being kept isolated in a so-called bubble between games to prevent contracting COVID-19.

It was the spring of 2010 and Clune, who had made his NHL debut earlier that season, was finally on the road to getting the help the 23-year-old knew he needed in his crippling addiction battle.

article continues below

With his younger brother, Matt, at the wheel, they drove through upstate New York in a torrential downpour home to Toronto. Clune wasn't sure he was going to make it.

""I was in the acute withdrawal phase,"" he said in a recent interview with The Canadian Press. ""I couldn't sit still for a second. The most logical thing at that point in time for me was to go jump off a bridge ... literally.

""I couldn't really see myself coming out of it.""

But come out of it he did, and a decade later, Clune is sharing his story in ""Hi, My Name is Dicky,"" a raw documentary available on iTunes and AppleTV that details his life from aspiring youth hockey player to out-of-control junior antagonist to pro athlete teetering on the edge — one consumed by drugs, alcohol and mental illness.

His journey to recovery started in earnest on that lonely stretch of highway.

""My brother really had to talk me off the ledge,"" Clune said. ""When I see his face and when I see my other brother Ben's face, that's what gave me strength to live, because I didn't really want to live for myself at that time.

""Matt, at a couple points on that drive, had to do things that no younger brother should have to do and really dig down deep and get me home.""

The documentary from Taylor Prestidge and Haris Usanovic of Upper Canada Films tracks Clune's life and career, recovery and redemption. It includes interviews with Clune's parents, brothers, teammates and coaches.

Clune was driven to be the best as a child, but the pressure led him down a dark path at early age.

""I made that decision I was going to put my head down and not see anything but being a hockey player,"" Clune, who was selected in the third round of the 2005 NHL draft by the Dallas Stars, says in the film.

He began to try alcohol in his early teens as a way to cope, and it escalated quickly once he got to high school and then the Ontario Hockey League.

""I had this hole inside me that made me insecure and afraid of the world,"" Clune recounts. ""I got wasted and was like, 'Wow. OK. I'll be able to do this. I can cope with this. It's like a warm blanket.'

""Alcohol saved me. It was my solution to that problem of being self-absorbed and focused on all the things that made me insecure and self-conscious and in pain and sad.""

But he didn't realize how much of a spiral his life was taking. In junior, he would drive from bar to bar, party to party, drinking, smoking marjiuana and doing cocaine.

""I wanted to walk that line of looking death in the face every day, but still play hockey and do all these things,"" Clune says in the film. ""I don't know how I did it.""

Things got worse after junior when he was living in the United States by himself before making his NHL debut in that fateful 2009-10 season, months before becoming completely unglued.

""I had achieved my goal,"" he recalls on screen. ""But I hated myself.""

Clune eventually checked into rehab a second time — he went once before, but didn't stay — and committed to getting better with a lot of help from the people around him.

After he got out, he resumed his career and went onto play a total of 120 regular-season games in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Nashville Predators. His contract was bought out in 2015, and he was again at a crossroads — retire or keep going.

That's when the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were in the early stages of their massive rebuild, came calling to see if Clune wanted to be part of their program. They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club. At the very least, he would play in the minors and help foster a new culture.

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, who was in charge of the minor-league Marlies at the time, saw something in Clune that could be useful.

""He provides a certain energy,"" Dubas said. ""He provides experience in his life that I thought brought a great spirit to our team.""

Clune played 19 games with Leafs, but the forward truly made his mark with the Marlies. He helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018 and plans to continue his on-ice career, but equally important was how he's helped mentor a number of current NHLers.

He's proud of where he is, and not shy talking about how he got there. Clune still goes to meetings, does the 12 steps and now works to help others.

He also thinks a lot about why he made the decision to live, to fight, and get better, when many others — including some fellow pro hockey players — have gone down a different path.

""In the beginning, it was because I wanted to see my brothers,"" said Clune, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Then it transformed into wanting to live for myself. I started to discover what it feels like to have self esteem and to have love.

""I just hope people realize that they're not alone with how they feel. Don't be afraid to ask for help.""

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

article continues below

""After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,"" Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal's three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first overall by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

""A low-maintenance superstar,"" said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg's senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At five foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn't blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack of getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday. ""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League. I think it was Dale's arrival that really cemented the future of the franchise and I think we all have recollections of that first year, that Calder (Trophy) year and then everything that would follow.

""He was truly a superstar as a hockey player, but I think why he was so loved here was not just that but largely the fact that he made this his home and became one of us. I think everybody shared that sense of pride in Dale's career as a player.""

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: ""All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL's all time greatest players.""

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

""What an incredible human being,"" Selanne tweeted.

Montreal Canadiens associate coach Kirk Muller also had a chance to speak with Hawerchuk in recent days.

""I talked to Dale a few days ago, and we had a good chance to chat. A good friend, had a real good opportunity to play against one of the all-time best players. As a hockey player, we all know how great he was, but he was a good friend and just a really special person, did a lot for charities. It's a real loss for us in the hockey world.""

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk ""one of the most decorated players in our game's history.""

In September 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

""For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I'm ready to fight it,"" he told TSN in October 2019. ""I want to live to tell the story.""

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie's bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames players Andrew Mangiapane and Rasmus Andersson remembered playing for Hawerchuk in Barrie.

""I don't know where I'd be without him,"" said Mangiapane. ""Very sad news today. I owe my career basically to him and the whole Barrie organization.""

Andersson, from Sweden, said ""Dale was a fantastic human being. Such a great person. My first week in Barrie he invited us over to his house and really just welcomed me to Canada. I cannot say enough good things about him as a person. Obviously a real good coach, too.""

""It's awful news.""

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday's opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at age two and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur's record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

""I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive — well maybe a little further now with the traffic,"" he said. ""I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""

""I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,"" he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and '81 with teammates that included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL's top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt like he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year — the youngest recipient at the time — and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

""Just one of the greatest. You could tell from day one. We knew from when he was 18 years old as a player that he would turn the (Jets) franchise around. Certainly one of the best I’ve ever played with and coached,"" said Dallas Stars coach Rick Bowness, who played with and coached Hawerchuk in the '80s.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

""He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,"" said Mike Doran, Winnipeg's director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the faceoff in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux's famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

""It turned out fantastic,"" said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada's call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets ""are etched in my mind every day that I live.""

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes' ring of honour.

Hawerchuk re-wrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia whom he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

""It's like going back down memory lane,"" he said in his induction speech.

""All the experiences have been fantastic,"" he added. ""I mean, sometimes they didn't feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing ... Even though I didn't win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn't change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.""

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets' Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November 2017.

""Tonight we fly Ducky's number high,"" said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue's ""Home Sweet Home,"" before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

""Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,"" said the PA announcer.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

""I've been to every part of (Manitoba), either golfing or playing (softball),"" Hawerchuk said. ""I've gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I'm honoured and I'm very humbled.""

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.

And that includes how to allow players under contract to CFL teams the ability to sign elsewhere — most notably the NFL — if the opportunity arises. On Monday, the CFL cancelled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The focus right now for us on a few certain things and one of them is ensuring if there's an ability for our players to receive some form of payment this year,"" Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA's executive director, said Monday during a conference call. ""They should be able to do that if they have an opportunity.""

While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season. However, 66 players have currently opted out of participating in the 2020 campaign, which could create opportunity for some CFL players to sign deals south of the border and have a chance to earn a football paycheque, either on the active roster or on the practice squad.

While there's no shortage of collegiate players available, the advantage a CFL player has is pro experience, a fact not lost upon NFL personnel people.

The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign. This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.

And players on NFL practice rosters receive at least US$8,000 per week.

Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the CFL is amendable to doing what it can to help its players.

""Where we can do something we will,"" he said. ""We're going to be committed to working towards good outcomes, the best possible outcomes we can have with out players.

""That's not going to mean we're going to be able to do everything but we're certainly going to go into this with a real positive spirit.""

Something else that will be on the CFL-CFLPA radar will be the current collective bargaining agreement, which is slated to expire after the 2021 season. But union president Solomon Elimimian said the two sides covered a lot of ground this time around during talks to amend the agreement for a shortened '20 season.

""Whether we deal with '21 when it comes or after the '21 season I think there's hope there that we can work together,"" Elimimian said. ""Obviously the relationship between the players and the league needs to be one where the players feel appreciated.

""Everyone wants to the league to reach its full potential. The partnership has to be one that's very genuine and the players have to feel part of that. If that happens, the sky is the limit.""

Ryu (2-1) struck out three and walked none. The left-hander permitted only one runner past second base and yielded just one extra-base hit to a team that came in ranked second in the majors with a .467 slugging percentage.

Rather than vie for strikeouts, Ryu said he was focused more on getting the Orioles to hit the ball weakly.

""I was able to keep them off balance,"" he said through an interpreter.

Signed in December to an $80 million, four-year contract, Ryu got off to a shaky start with Toronto in July before showing the form he displayed as a star with the Dodgers. He's given up a total of two runs in his last three starts after allowing eight runs over nine innings in his first two outings.

""That was vintage Ryu,"" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. ""Ryu was outstanding. That's the reason we won the game.""

The two home runs were a factor, but mostly Ryu was the difference-maker.

""They didn’t give Ryu that big contract for nothing,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""You just never know what he’s going to throw. You don’t know what side of the plate he’s going to throw to. He’s really tough on right-handers because he can locate it in. You saw a lot of us get jammed.""

The Blue Jays took control with a four-run third against Alex Cobb (1-2). Three infield hits produced a run before Grichuk delivered a three-run drive over the centre-field wall. It was his third home run of the season, all in the last four games.

""Obviously, the pitch to Grichuk was middle middle and it was a poorly executed pitch,"" Cobb said. ""But most of the pitches that I had, I felt like I executed. I got the results.""

Cobb gave up five runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He’s winless in his last four starts.

After hitting 31 homers last year, Grichuk was batting fifth, sixth or seventh in the order this season before Montoyo decided to move him into the No. 2 spot Sunday to replace injured Bo Bichette. Over the past two games, Grichuk has two homers, four hits and six RBIs.

Pedro Severino and Renato Núñez had RBIs for the Orioles, who have dropped two straight after winning seven of eight.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Bichette (right knee sprain) had an MRI and will receive a second opinion on his injury, Montoyo said. Bichette leads Toronto with a .361 batting average.

Orioles: RH Dillon Tate (elbow contusion) came off the injured list and RH Evan Phillips was optioned to the team's alternate site.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: RH Nate Pearson (0-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his fourth start in his first big league season Tuesday night. Drafted 28th overall in 2017, the 23-year-old is looking to rebound after giving up four runs to Miami last week in 2 1/3 innings. ""I'm developing at the highest level,"" Pearson said Monday. ""When I don't have my best stuff, I'm going to struggle.""

Orioles: LH Wade LeBlanc (1-0, 7.13) has allowed a combined 10 runs over 12 innings in his last three starts.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

""We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,"" Marchand said. ""That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.""

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

""We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do — little battles,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.""

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President's Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk's first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy's hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina's captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy putaway from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston's first six post-season games.

""There's other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.""

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen's late goal.

""That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,"" Williams said. ""We got it handed to us.""

NOTES: David Pastrnak had a goal and an assist in Boston’s double-overtime win in Game 1, but hasn’t played since. He had 48 regular-season goals to tie Washington’s Alex Ovechkin for the league lead. … Carolina played without 20-year-old Andrei Svechnikov, who was injured when his leg twisted awkwardly beneath him late in the third period of Saturday's loss. ... DeBrusk scored his 12th and 13th playoff goals since his 2018 post-season debut. … The Hurricanes were also without D Joel Edmundson for the third straight game. … Jake Gardiner assisted on Williams’ first-period goal for his first post-season point with Carolina.

The credit reporting agency said in a quarterly report that credit card balances fell 12.3 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period a year ago.

Reduced opportunities for spending during the lockdown may have contributed to the drop, said TransUnion's Matt Fabian, but he also noted that people are dipping into savings or retirement funds rather than relying on credit cards.

""Recent feedback from our survey seems like the folks that say they're still experiencing a lot of financial hardship continues to drop. And there's a lot more certainty in terms of the response, in terms of what they're going to do. Consumers have fortified themselves,"" said Fabian.

TransUnion uses the credit bureaus' national consumer credit database as source material for its quarterly report.

Applications for new credit also grew at a slower-than-usual pace amid reduced access to branches during the lockdown, uncertainty around employment and a pullback on new offers from lenders.

The report did note that credit balances for Millennials and Gen Z consumers grew 0.8 per cent and 5.9 per cent, respectively, as those consumers have less buffer in the form of savings, investments or retirement funds. Overall instalment loan debt also rose by 3.9 per cent in the second quarter to $175.4 billion, up from $168.8 billion a year ago.

Mortgage debt is on the rise, TransUnion said, with new mortgages, renewals and refinances up 29 per cent from a year ago and a 5.3 per cent annual increase in the total volume of mortgage debt.

""The spring, that's usually the big mortgage season or the big home buying season. With people not being able to go out, and constraints around travelling and visiting homes and looking at new homes, once some of those lock downs were lifted, we've seen sort of a real surge,"" Fabian said.

""Certainly for some consumers that have existing mortgages, deferrals were an option, and a lot of consumers opted to take it … certainly for a lot of people, a mortgage might be one of the biggest monthly or biweekly expenses that they'd have.""

Despite a 4.3 per cent rise in total outstanding debt in Canada, which stood at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter, Fabian says delinquencies have risen less than expected, as about 2.6 million Canadians, or 9.2 per cent of credit consumers, have at least one active deferral.

Delinquencies also were on the rise for personal loans, which TransUnion noted are ""partly fuelled by alternative lenders who have been slightly more aggressive in issuing personal loans to below prime consumers.""

""We have seen delinquency rates go up a little bit, but a lot less than we had expected… and I think part of that is the deferral and forbearance processes that are in place with the lenders as well as the support from the government,"" said Fabian.

""Delinquency tends to be a long-tail thing where it takes a while. People have exhaust all their options before they will start to continuously skip and miss payments. As deferrals come off and the government subsidization ends, we expect to see some delinquency spike.""

""I think there’s a great deal of uncertainty, and that’s something that the finance minister will also have to deal with.""","Canada's next finance minister faces a serious challenge as the country charts its way through the most difficult economic circumstances since the Great Depression.

Chrystia Freeland, who was sworn in Tuesday afternoon after Bill Morneau resigned late Monday, will have to manage a COVID-19 recovery that is still very much under way, with more than 40 per cent of the three million workers who lost jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic still unemployed as of mid-July.

article continues below

The path forward for jobless Canadians is still taking shape. Fewer than one-third of the 4.7 million people who were receiving the $2,000-per-month Canada Emergency Response Benefit at the beginning of August would qualify for Employment Insurance when CERB ends on Sept. 26, according to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, though the government has promised to ease EI eligibility rules.

The unemployment rate currently sits at 10.9 per cent, according to Statistics Canada's July labour force survey, which noted almost twice as many people were unemployed than in February.

Meanwhile, the spectre of protectionism continues to loom large after U.S. President Donald Trump reimposed tariffs on Canadian aluminum earlier this month — Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden also harbours protectionist sentiments — further complicating trade relationships.

Key to the task of drafting a budget will be weighing whether to patch up a frayed social safety net or to broaden it with reinforced rope.

""There are huge challenges in terms of how our social safety net has actually been exposed through COVID to be kind of thin and narrow,"" said Sheila Block, a senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.

""Years and years of underinvestment in public services have really come back to bite us.""

Potential changes to employment insurance — thresholds for hours worked, payment amounts and inclusion of self-employed and gig economy workers — fall under the purview of the employment minister, ""but eventually it lands on the finance minister,"" Block said.

Debt presents another dilemma for Freeland. Ottawa has been pumping money into the economy since March, resulting in a projected debt of $343 billion, an increase of more than 1,000 per cent from the previous year.

Much of that spending has gone toward a federal wage subsidy for troubled businesses, which has been extended until at least December. Further extensions and tweaks to the program — it will cost the government an estimated $67.9 billion through the end of the year, according to a report last week by the Parliamentary Budget Office — will rest largely in Freeland's hands.

Fiscal policy is already running ""at full throttle,"" said Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter, with the 2020-21 federal debt-to-GDP ratio headed about 49 per cent compared to 31 per cent currently.

The longer-term issue is whether the surge in spending linked to the coronavirus will morph into a more permanent trend, with attendant tax and debt implications, he said.

Despite a drastic uptick, the debt-to-GDP ratio remains well below danger zones highlighted by the International Monetary Fund and the highs of the mid-1990s, when it reached two-thirds.

Interest rates are also at historic lows, which means the borrowed cash comes cheap.

Morneau's resignation could portend a doubling down on a ""'fairness' agenda,"" with ""more fiscal activism"" the likely outcome, said Derek Holt, vice-president at Scotiabank Economics.

""The timing works well, as resigning in August gives plenty of time for a material shift in the fiscal stance before the unconfirmed fall budget or update and Throne Speech,"" Holt said in a research note.

The Business Council of Canada on Tuesday urged the government to set clear fiscal targets and rein in spending given a projected net debt in 2020-21 of $1.2 trillion, saying in a letter to Freeland that ""interest rates will rise eventually.""

CEO Goldy Hyder said there is an ""urgent need"" for Ottawa to pivot to an ""economic growth and prosperity agenda,"" with an eye to structural issues ranging from an aging population and climate change to ""regulatory obstacles that go well beyond pipelines.""

Freeland brings to the table a background steeped in financial journalism — she penned the 2012 book ""Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else"" — and delicate trade negotiations with the U.S. during her nearly two-year stint as foreign affairs minister.

""Her communication skills and prior background as a financial journalist and policy wonk will serve her well in the role as will her global mindset. Freeland could well be the country’s best — if not only — chance at a female prime minister within a reasonable time horizon,"" Holt said.

Some previous finance ministers have landed in the role after prominent business careers, including Morneau and Paul Martin, but others such as Jean Chretien, Jim Flaherty and John Manley took on the title without any executive experience.

""Being a titan of industry in particular in these times is not necessarily the best qualification for a finance minister,"" Block said, citing inequality and the pandemic as the towering economic issues of the day.

""I think there’s a great deal of uncertainty, and that’s something that the finance minister will also have to deal with.""

The five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations are upset that Ottawa decided to give a surplus allocation of salmon — which arose this year due to reduced recreational fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic — to commercial fishers rather than to the First Nations.

Clifford Atleo, lead negotiator for one of the nations who is also called Wickaninnish, says he feels sports and commercial troll fishers are given more rights to fish in the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

He says the latest decision to shut First Nations fishers out of an opportunity to catch more chinook salmon this year shows systemic racism is ""alive and well"" within the federal fisheries department.

""We feel very strongly we're not being dealt with fairly, we know we're not being dealt with fairly,"" Atleo said.

""It's just another layer of disappointment on the part of how the government deals with us. The government doesn't realize that their attitude toward our people is dyed-in-the-wool ... And I think the government — sometimes they don't realize they're being racist. They've got age-old policies that have never changed.""

A 2018 B.C. Supreme Court ruling directed Ottawa to take a more ""generous approach"" to allocations of chinook salmon to the First Nations given the importance of this species to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people.

The ruling from B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Humphries noted that the government's salmon allocation policy at the time gave recreational fisherman priority to fish for chinook and soho salmon ahead of the First Nations and advised the fisheries minister to reassess this policy.

Despite this ruling and changes that have since placed the First Nations at a higher priority than sport fishers, the Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ehattesaht and Mowachaht/Muchalaht nations say their yearly fishing allocations have not increased.

This year, the five First Nations were told they could fish 7,724 chinook, which amounts to just 1.5 fish per person for the 5,000 members of their communities.

COVID-19 brought a new dynamic to the salmon allocations this year, as fewer sport fishers were able to come due to pandemic restrictions. This means the recreational fleet is expected to catch 15,000 less salmon than was forecasted for this year, according to figures provided by the department.

None of this surplus is going to the First Nations.

""As per approved management plans, the Area G (commercial) harvest is adjusted based on the projected recreational harvests which results in an increase of 15,000 for 2020,"" said department spokesperson Athina Vazeos.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan was unavailable for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Jennifer Kuss, noted the improvements made in giving the five nations a higher priority in the yearly salmon catch allocations, as directed by the courts.

""This change ensures that food, social, and ceremonial (fishing) continues to be prioritized first, and additionally prioritizes the Five Nations rights-based sale fishery over the recreational and commercial fishery,"" Kuss said in a statement.

The Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations argue Ottawa could have provided some of the unused catch from this year to their people to help them support their remote communities. But Atleo said fisheries officials would not even engage in discussions about it.

""The government is trying to say they consult with us, they negotiate with us. They create their fishing plans, put it on the table and it's like take or leave it,"" Atleo said.

""All we want to do is be part of the economy, part of looking after ourselves without depending on government. We don't think that's a lot to ask.""

NDP MP Gord Johns, whose riding takes in the West Coast fishing shores, said he finds it ""disgusting"" the Trudeau government has repeatedly highlighted its desire to restore the Crown's relationship with Indigenous Peoples but has still fought many legal battles with these nations over their fishing rights.

""Indigenous people in our communities rely on this fishery for their economy, for their food security, for their culture. It's part of their way of life. These are salt water people and they rely on the salmon and to be denied their right is shameful, it's disgusting that the government is taking this approach.""

The First Nations are calling on Ottawa to revisit its decision on the surplus salmon for this year to allow them a portion of the additional catch.

""The government has an opportunity to fix this with these (surplus salmon) to come with a fair opportunity to exercise their commitment, in the judge's words, for a generous allocation to the nations and to start moving forward with reconciliation,"" Johns said.

The minister's spokeswoman says Jordan takes any allegations of systemic racism ""very seriously"" and that Ottawa is working with the five nations on a reconciliation agreement on fisheries resources, which is intended to broaden their access in the area, Kuss said.

""The road to reconciliation is a long journey, and Canada is committed to moving forward together. The department has spoken with the five nations on the reallocation of (salmon catch) on multiple occasions and that open dialogue will continue.""

Tim Walz's administration said Tuesday it will appeal the latest approvals by state utility regulators for Enbridge Energy's plan to replace its old and corroding Line 3 crude oil pipeline across northern Minnesota.

The state Commerce Department faced a Wednesday deadline to ask the Minnesota Court of Appeals to take another look at the project. Environmental and tribal groups opposed to the pipeline have already filed their appeals.

Walz said in a statement that the state must follow ""the process, the law, and the science"" for any project that impacts Minnesota's environment and economy.

""The Department of Commerce's appeal is a part of that process, and it is important to ensure clarity in the steps that Minnesota takes to evaluate and approve projects like this one,"" Walz said.

House Republican Leader Kurt Daudt of Crown said Walz was ""wasting taxpayer resources in an attempt to stop this project.""

""Instead of helping the one in four Minnesotans unemployed along the Line 3 route, the Governor has once again chosen to obstruct and delay this critical project and the thousands of jobs it would bring to Northern Minnesota,"" Daudt said.

Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge says its planned $2.6 billion investment will put 4,200 people to work in union construction jobs while boosting tax revenues for the state and communities along the route.

The company called the Walz administration's decision disappointing. The project has undergone six years of review, more than 70 public meetings and a 13,500-page Environmental Impact Statement, the company said.

But Enbridge said it remains confident that the courts will uphold Minnesota regulators' approvals and that it will continue to pursue the remaining permits with a goal of starting construction as soon as they are received.

Supporters and opponents of the project had stepped up pressure on the state government in recent days. Opponents rallied outside the Capitol and the official Governor's Residence on Tuesday to urge him to keep up the fight, while supporters brought petitions and replica pipes to the Capitol last Thursday to urge no more delays or appeals.

Enbridge says replacing the aging pipeline, which was built in the 1960s, is the safest option for maintaining the oil supply to Midwest refineries.

Opponents have long argued that the Canadian tar sands oil that the replacement pipeline would carry would aggravate climate change, and that spills could endanger sensitive waters and wetlands in the Mississippi River headwaters region where Native Americans harvest wild rice and claim treaty rights.

The Public Utilities Commission reaffirmed its support for the project in February. The commission originally approved the environmental review and issued a certificate of need and route permit in 2018. But the Minnesota Court of Appeals sent the review back to the PUC for further study on the potential risks of an oil spill in the Lake Superior watershed. The Commerce Department then conducted additional modeling and concluded in the final review that there was little chance of a spill reaching the lake.

However, the department joined with other opponents in petitioning the commission to reconsider anyway. They argued that new evidence had emerged in the meantime, including a drop in oil demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. Commerce specifically argued that Enbridge had failed to conduct a legally adequate long-range demand forecast. But the commission rejected those arguments and voted 4-1 to reaffirm its support for the project.

The Commerce Department said in a statement it would appeal because Enbridge did not introduce a long-term demand forecast that the PUC could evaluate, and because the commission had shifted the burden of proof from Enbridge to the department and others to show that demand for oil transmitted by Line 3 would decrease during the forecast period.

Line 3 starts in Alberta and clips a corner of North Dakota before crossing northern Minnesota en route to Enbridge’s terminal in Superior, Wisconsin. Replacement sections in Canada and Wisconsin are already in service.

The project has been politically sensitive for the Democratic governor’s administration at a time when Republicans who control the Minnesota Senate have been flexing their political muscles. Republicans generally back the project while Democrats have been split.

Commerce Commissioner Steve Kelley is expected to face questions about Line 3 at a Senate confirmation hearing Friday.

The S&P/TSX composite index fell 30.06 points to 16,626.06.

The energy sector led the decline with shares in the sector, on average, losing 1.58 per cent of their worth as the price of oil retreated. The October crude contract lost five cents to US$43.12 per barrel.

Oil prices have struggled to make notable headway beyond the US$43 mark, said Bangsund, as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to suppress the outlook for oil demand.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries leaders are set to meet Wednesday, she added, ""so the market may be in a bit of a holding pattern in anticipation of what's to come out of that meeting.""

As well as resources, the financial sector fell Tuesday, down 0.5 per cent.

Indexes south of the border have higher exposure to growth-oriented sectors than the TSX, said Bangsund, such as the technology giants and consumer-discretionary stocks like Amazon that led Tuesday's performance charge.

In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average shed 66.84 points to 27,778.07.

The Nasdaq composite rose 81.12 points to 11,210.84, while the S&P 500 index added 7.79 points to 3,389.78 finally cracking its previous all-time closing high of 3,386.15 set in February.

The S&P 500 also cracked its previous intraday high, also set in February, hitting a record 3,395.06 earlier in the trading day.

""Surprisingly we're not seeing a lot of reaction to the news of Finance Minister (Bill) Morneau's resignation,"" said Bangsund.

Morneau resigned late Monday. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland was sworn in as his replacement Tuesday afternoon.

""The one area you would thought would be most impacted would be in the currency market,"" said Bangsund, ""but the Canadian dollar is actually stronger on the day owing mainly to the unrelenting drop in the U.S. dollar.""

The Canadian dollar traded for 75.93 cents US compared with 75.72 cents US on Monday.

Calfrac Well Services Ltd. (TSX:CFW). Unchanged at nearly $0.16. A Texas suitor for Calgary-based Calfrac Well Services Ltd. is urging shareholders to reject a management recapitalization proposal favoured by its senior debtholders. Wilks Brothers LLC says Calfrac's announcement on Monday that it will recommend stakeholders vote in favour of management's debt-for-shares proposal is ""deeply troubling"" as it promotes the interests of ""self-selected"" insiders and unsecured noteholders. It says that if shareholders reject the management alternative when the matter is put to a vote on Sept. 17, the Wilks proposal — which it argues offers better recoveries for stakeholders and a stronger capital structure for Calfrac — will remain on the table. Calfrac said Monday a special committee of its directors found the Texas bid lacks enough support to be successful, noting the original plan has the support of 78 per cent of holders of senior unsecured notes. It warned rejection could mean no recovery for shareholders.

Companies in the news:

Suncor Energy Inc. — Shares in Suncor Energy fell Monday after it reported it will be early September before bitumen production resumes at its base oilsands mining operation in Fort McMurray, Alta., following a fire on Friday. The Calgary-based company's stock fell by as much as 37 cents or 1.6 per cent to $22.20 on Monday after it released an update on operations in the wake of the blaze in the extraction area of the mine. Suncor said its two upgraders at the oilsands project are working at minimum rates to process strip-mined bitumen inventory, as well as production piped in from its other operations that use steam to produce bitumen from shallow wells.

Paramount Resources Ltd. (TSX:POU). Up 13 cents, or 4.19 per cent, to $3.23. Oil and gas company Paramount Resources Ltd. is demanding a cash payout for its shares in Strath Resources Ltd. when it is merged with another private firm. Calgary-based Paramount says neither the amalgamation nor the process followed were in the best interests of Strath and its shareholders and it is exercising its ""right of dissent"" under the Alberta Business Corporations Act to be bought out for fair value. It didn't specify a price. In 2018, Strath bought Paramount's oil and gas producing assets in the Kakwa region of northwestern Alberta for $340 million, with half paid in cash and the rest by 85 million common shares at $2 each. The deal gave Paramount 15.6 per cent ownership of Strath and a seat on its board of directors.

It says the senior management team is working with government authorities on an investigation of the accident. The Kamoa-Kakula project is a joint venture in which Ivanhoe Mines and Zijin Mining Group each hold 39.6 per cent and the DRC government owns 20 per cent.

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

article continues below

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister.
""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.
""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.
MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.","OTTAWA — Chrystia Freeland shattered a glass ceiling Tuesday, becoming the first woman to be sworn in as Canada's finance minister.

The gravitas of the moment was not lost on the former journalist and mother of three. After she spoke the English words of her oath of office, she paused to take a deep breath, before repeating the oath in French.

article continues below

""It's about time,"" Freeland said later at a press conference on Parliament Hill.

She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.

Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.

But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.

""There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,"" said Turnbull. ""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.""

Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.

She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.

""We don't like their representative very much,"" he said of her in September 2018.

Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said ""Mama (does not equal) chopped liver."" On the back it said ""Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.""

When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.

And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.

""She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,"" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.

He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.

""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.

""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.

""I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,"" he said. ""And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.""

She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.

""What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,"" Kelly said on Twitter. ""This has been missing in the department for several years.""

MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.

While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.

Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.

Trudeau said Tuesday that she had been ""a key player in my government from day one.""

The Nisga'a Lisims government said Tuesday that Gosnell died in his home in New Aiyansh after a long battle with cancer.

article continues below

Gosnell was a hereditary Nisga'a chieftain of the Eagle Clan and was president of the nation when it finalized a landmark treaty in 2000 that gave the First Nation control over its land including forestry and fishing rights. It was the first modern-day treaty signed in B.C. since the 1800s.

Nisga'a Nation president Eva Clayton said Gosnell's wisdom, dignity and determination helped lead the First Nation into self-government over its territory northeast of Prince Rupert.

""Today, we have lost a giant,"" Clayton said in a statement. ""His legacy will help shape the project of reconciliation for generations to come.""

Gosnell was a recipient of the Order of Canada, the Order of B.C. and held an honorary doctorate of laws from Royal Roads University in Victoria.

He is survived by his wife of 64 years, Audrey, their seven children and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Gosnell grew up in the Nass River Valley in B.C.'s northwest. He worked as a commercial fisherman, carpenter and traditional carver before he was elected as a band councillor and chief of the Gitlaxt'aamiks Band, one of the Nisga'a village governments.

Gosnell was appointed chancellor of the University of Northern B.C. last year and served until his death.

University interim president Geoffrey Payne said Gosnell's dedication to education was evident during his time as chancellor.

""The world has lost a tremendous leader, a man who repeatedly demonstrated a love for his community, his people, education and a commitment to enhancing the lives of others,"" Payne said in a statement.

Clayton said Gosnell's work to negotiate the Nisga'a Treaty produced a ""beacon of hope"" for people around the world.

""His focus was always on what the Nisga'a, British Columbians and Canadians can achieve together,"" she said.

When a bill to accept the treaty was introduced in the legislature in December 1998, Gosnell told the house the agreement proved to the world that reasonable people can sit down and settle historical wrongs.

""It's a triumph because under the treaty, we will no longer be wards of the state, no longer beggars in our own land. It's a triumph because under the treaty, we will collectively own approximately 2,000 square kilometres of land, far exceeding the postage-stamp reserve set aside for us by colonial governments.""

He said the treaty proved that negotiations — not lawsuits, blockades or violence — are the most effective and honourable way to resolve Aboriginal issues.

""It's a triumph, I believe, that signals the end of the Indian Act, the end of more than a century of humiliation, degradation and despair for the Nisga'a Nation.""

Premier John Horgan said in a tweet that everyone can learn from Gosnell's legacy of working to make life better for people and he'll be missed.

""He was instrumental in helping the Nisga'a chart a new path of self-governance through BC's first modern treaty.""

The nation said funeral arrangements will be announced by the family.

The BC Wildfire Service said crews are responding to the fire on Christie Mountain about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, on the east side of Skaha Lake.

The fire is estimated at 250 hectares and firefighters on the ground are being supported by air tankers.

The service said the situation was ""rapidly evolving"" and asked everyone to stay clear of the area to avoid interfering with the operation.

The order asks residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with pets and critical items.

""We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,"" the service said in a tweet.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a ""fire of note"" on Tuesday.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was smouldering with no open flame but was considered out of control. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight.

Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Firefighters have tackled dozens of wildfires after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions.

Two fires were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.

A joint news release three groups that make up the First Nations Leadership Council says Bernadette Jordan should also declare the stock collapsed while their groups come together to create a strategy to save the fish.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada has estimated returning sockeye would hit a record low this year, with about 283,000 fish or fewer making it from the ocean to their Fraser River spawning grounds.

Just last month, the department estimated 941,000 sockeye would return, though it noted salmon forecasts were highly uncertain, in part because of a lack of understanding of the effects of warming ocean waters.

The council, made up of the B.C. Assembly of First Nations, the First Nations Summit and Union of B.C. Indian chiefs, says Indigenous communities that rely on the salmon for food face the greatest impacts, but the department has consistently prioritized commercial fishing.

Representatives with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans were not immediately available for comment.

First Nations fishing rights are protected by the Constitution and the council says the federal government has failed in its duty to ensure they have priority access to salmon.

Robert Phillips with the First Nations Summit says Indigenous leaders have been calling on Ottawa to save the salmon for decades and it's time for full jurisdiction over salmon stocks to be transferred back to First Nations.

Five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations on Vancouver Island have also accused federal fisheries officials of systemic racism after the government decided to exclude them in the allocation of 15,000 extra salmon this year — a surplus that arose because fewer people were fishing recreationally during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Salmon returning to the Fraser River also face the added hurdle of making it over a massive landslide along a remote stretch of the river north of Lillooet.

A pneumatic pump and tube system and the construction of a fish ladder have been installed to help salmon over the five-metre waterfall created by the slide.

In an update last week, Fisheries and Oceans said water levels have dropped sufficiently in recent days to allow fish to pass over the slide on their own steam.

A Department of Fisheries document from 2017 says total adult returns of Fraser River sockeye are highly variable ranging from 2 to 28 million, with an average of 9.6 million, between 1980 and 2014.

In documents filed by her court-appointed lawyer that give a rare public airing to the wishes of the 38-year-old pop superstar, she asked that her father not return to the role of conservator of her person, which gave him power over her major life decisions from 2008 until 2019, when he temporarily stepped aside, citing health problems.

article continues below

""Britney is strongly opposed to James return as conservator of her person,"" the document says.

James Spears has kept his separate role as conservator over his daughter's finances. For the first 11 years of the conservatorship, he served as co-conservator with attorney Andrew M. Wallet, who resigned from the role early last year.

That briefly left James Spears with sole power over Britney Spears' life, money and career, a situation she says she very much wants to avoid repeating.

An email seeking comment from James Spears' attorney was not immediately returned.

Spears says she wants Jodi Montgomery, who has been serving as conservator of her person temporarily, to do so permanently, but she says that doesn't mean she is waiving her right to seek an end to the entire arrangement.

The documents also reveal that Britney Spears has no plans to perform again anytime soon. She last performed live in October 2018, and early in 2019, cancelled a planned Las Vegas residency.

The filing gave a rare glimpse at Britney Spears' own wishes in the conservatorship that has had vast power over her for over a decade. She has almost never spoken publicly about the matter, and court hearings and documents in the case are cloaked in secrecy, though last year she addressed the court at her request, suggesting she was seeking changes.

In the papers, Britney Spears praises the conservatorship and its work overall, saying it ""rescued her from a collapse, exploitation by predatory individuals and financial ruin"" and that it made her ""able to regain her position as a world class entertainer.""

The document was filed a day before a status hearing on the conservatorship, expected to be closed to the media and public.

Britney Spears' attorney said that he expects James Spears will aggressively contest being marginalized, and said that Britney Spears has suggested they retain a lawyer with expertise in complex financial court fights.

The conservatorship, known in some states as a guardianship, gave James Spears power over his daughter's career choices and much of her personal life, including her relationship with her teenage sons. Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline has custody of the boys, but she has frequent visits with them.

When you are The Killers and your usual guitarist has gone, no problem. When you’re The Killers you can turn to Lindsey Buckingham.

article continues below

The former Fleetwood Mac guitarist steps in for a tune on the new 10-song ""Imploding the Mirage,"" another sign of the band’s clout. The album's guests also include k.d. lang and Adam Granduciel of The War on Drugs.

The absence of guitarist and co-founder Dave Keuning is felt, with keyboards and drums stepping into the void. Without Keuning’s jangle and riff shards, The Killers have a more poppy sound.

If 2017's ""Wonderful Wonderful"" was a meditation on the anxiety of masculinity, the new album often explores the lives of women, with two sharp portraits of tough survivors in ""Blowback"" and ""Caution"" — women whom Brandon Flowers sings each come from ""white trash.""

Many other songs are about loyally backing a partner. ""I’ll be there when water’s rising/I’ll be your lifeguard,"" Flowers sings on ""Dying Breed."" On ""When the Dreams Run Dry,"" he vows: ""I’ll be on your side/When the dreams run dry."" In ""Lightening Fields,"" he sings, ""Just wanted to run my fastest/And stand beside you."" The cover of the album depicts a god tenderly supporting a goddess.

Jonathan Rado of California psychedelic-rock duo Foxygen and Shawn Everett — who worked on ""Wonderful Wonderful"" as well as with Kacey Musgraves and Alabama Shakes — have stepped in to produce and their influence can best be heard on the funky ""Fire in Bone.""

Elsewhere, listeners may have fun finding the band's other influences. There's a Tom Petty-ish sound to ""Blowback"" and ""My Own Soul's Warning"" has a Springsteen vibe. But there's no mistaking that classic Killers mix of soaring vocals, sonic bombast and sly humour in such songs as ""My God"" and the title track. It's a solid album from a band still exploring.

""This is me. I am 'Pipe Nation,'"" she said with a laugh Monday during an interview with The Canadian Press in Sundre, Alta., a picturesque oil town nestled near the Rocky Mountains.

article continues below

""I've been working in the oil and gas industry for about six years. I took a break when the bust happened and did a little serving, a little bartending but always went back to the oil and gas,"" added Gamble, who is 24.

""My father, my grandfather and my great grandfather were all in the oil and gas industry as well.""

Sundre is set to become the fictional community of Hardwell. The drama will focus on day-to-day hardships labourers face, with Gamble's character as the leader of a pipe gang — workers who position and align the pipe, preparing it for the weld. In real life, Gamble has held a number of jobs in the industry including welding.

But this is her first acting part since middle school.

""I always wanted to become an actor because I always thought pretending to be someone and falling into a character is a lot of fun and being someone else,"" she said.

""Unfortunately that's not the direction I went to until now when I got handed this beautiful opportunity that my little-girl dream could come true.""

Filmmaker and director Raoul Bhatt says he wanted a mix of both professional and amateur actors on set, and he's not concerned about the lack of experience from some of his cast members. He sees it as an asset to the project.

""I needed this to be believable and I needed someone with a certain language, a certain grit, combined with people who have actor experience,"" said Bhatt, adding 480 people showed up for the casting call. ""I wanted someone who's believable, honest, sincere and lives in the moment.""

Bhatt, who grew up in Edmonton, has a soft spot for the energy sector and says the show is meant to spotlight the colourful nature of the individuals.

""They're just beautiful people and to showcase that beyond the Dow Jones, beyond just the oil and gas numbers to human struggle, conditions and overcoming adversity and the determination of these characters is what the show is about,"" he said.

Bhatt, a software engineer who self-funded the pilot, has worked as a cinematographer and producer for the Daytime Emmys, as well as with Universal Studios' ""Jurassic World"" and a number of music videos.

He understands there are plenty of people out there who are not fans of the oil and gas industry.

""We are leaning toward pro but again that's for the viewer to decide. If you're against the oil and gas industry that's your opinion but I really hope this creates an emotional connection with the characters.""

Filming of the pilot will be completed by the end of August. Bhatt said he is in negotiations with a couple of streaming services for a 10-episode season.

A storage lot for oilfield equipment in Sundre is one of the regular sets. In addition, a portion of farmland in Sundre has been cleared for the actual building of a mini pipeline to add to the realism of the show.

Bhatt isn't short on technical advisers. Gin Ford, who plays the character Dee, has been a pipeline welder for the past 10-plus years. She has no acting experience but intends to use the show as a vessel for female empowerment and women in the energy industry.

""I'm not here for fame or recognition. I am actually here to make a voice for women in trades. Here's the moment for me to be a voice,"" said Ford.

""I've been called the pipeline princess and it's like, you can roll onto site and right way it's 'this girl's out here to work?'"" she said.

""I definitely want to highlight you can look like you want and you can still work in a male-dominated industry. It doesn't matter if you've got the nails, the lashes, the hair or the Barbie image.""

Ford said the show is meant to be raw, but it's not reality TV or a documentary.

""I'm not going to lie. My mom's probably going to tell me to wash my mouth out with some soap,"" Ford said, noting her character is tough-talking, confident and keeps up with the guys.

Mike Vickers plays Ryan, an East Coaster who moved to Alberta to make his fortune in the oil industry. Art imitates life for Vickers who moved to Alberta from Cape Breton.

""When I read the script it was my life. I fell in love with this. It's going to really showcase that true oil and gas grit, the struggles we all face and how we overcome it together as a family,"" Vickers said.

""There's so much opportunity to better the image of this industry and it's how we all come together is how we're going to do this and tell this story.""

Filming in Sundre is expected to wrap up by Aug. 24 and will finish in Nisku, south of Edmonton, by the end of the month.

Michelaine Lahaie, chair of the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for RCMP, says a video shows an RCMP officer opening the door of a moving police vehicle, which hits the man.

The officer and other Mounties then use force to arrest him while he's on the ground.

Lahaie says the man was then injured in an alleged assault by another detained man in a cell at the Kinngait RCMP detachment and had to be flown to Iqaluit for medical treatment.

She says the investigation is to determine whether the conduct of the Mounties, including use of force, was reasonable.

She says in a news release that the probe will be a Public Interest Investigation into the conduct of RCMP in Kinngait.

""The RCMP members' conduct will be assessed in accordance with relevant law and RCMP policy,"" reads the terms of reference of the investigation released Tuesday.

""Consideration will also be given as to whether racial bias and/or discrimination played a role in the man's arrest and subsequent treatment.""

Lahaie noted the review she has requested by the commission is separate from an investigation by the Ottawa Police Service at the request of the Mounties and an RCMP internal Code of Conduct review.

""I am concerned with the conduct of RCMP members involved in this serious incident and will monitor both the OPS (Ottawa police) investigation and the RCMP's Code of Conduct investigation,"" Lahaie said in a release.

""The CRCC's investigation will provide an added level of scrutiny to the incident, as it will additionally examine the circumstances that led to the man being placed in a cell at the RCMP detachment where another detainee assaulted him and he needed to be airlifted to Iqaluit for treatment.

""I am aware that there is historical distrust by Inuit toward the police and I am committed to increasing RCMP accountability.""

The day after the man's arrest Nunavut Justice Minister Jeannie Ehaloak said she was outraged.

""I have seen the video from Kinngait circulating on social media and am very concerned by the unnecessary force, the violence and the lack of respect I have seen,'' she said in a release at the time.

""Nunavummiut should not fear this kind of treatment and disregard for safety and basic rights.''

Ehaloak said she would formally request a review by the commission.

The Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the Mounties was created to ensure that public complaints made about the conduct of RCMP members are examined fairly and impartially.

Here is what that means and what could come next.

Word — The term comes through Middle English and Old French from a Latin root, prorogare, to prolong.

article continues below

Effect — Prorogation essentially ends a session of Parliament, allowing for a new beginning with a speech from the throne.

Legislation — At one time, prorogation killed all legislation before Parliament, but rule changes now provide that most bills can be revived in the new session at the same stage they were at when the previous session ended.

Committees — Committees, including special and legislative committees, cease to exist. Membership on committees, except the membership of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, is terminated and all chairs and vice-chairs no longer hold these positions.

Documents — No document may be tabled until the first day of a new session.

Quote — ""Prorogation of a session brings to an end all proceedings before Parliament. With certain exceptions, unfinished business 'dies' on the Order Paper and must be started anew in a subsequent session."" — House of Commons Procedure and Practice, Third Edition, 2017.

Length — Prorogation can be as short as a few hours, or as long as several months. During this period, the House of Commons and Senate are shut down but the government remains in power and MPs remain MPs.

Frequency — Most Parliaments are prorogued at least once and often there are several prorogations and sessions in the life of a Parliament.

Authority — Prorogation is ordered by the Governor General on the advice of the prime minister. It is not covered by statute. Rather it is a personal legal power of the Governor General and by convention the prime minister has the right to provide advice. And by convention it's actually the prime minister's decision.

Granted — Prorogation is routinely granted. In December 2008, then-governor general Michaelle Jean took a few hours before granting prorogation, but that was a thorny case because opposition parties were threatening to defeat the government and install a coalition government shortly after an election.

Ceremony — At one time, prorogation was done in a formal ceremony in the Senate chamber, but that hasn't been used in decades. A simple proclamation signed by the Governor General does the trick today.

Liberal promise — In their 2015 election platform, the Liberals said Stephen Harper's Conservatives ""used prorogation to avoid difficult political circumstances. We will not.""

Limits — Governments can't use prorogation to shut down Parliament indefinitely. That would violate the constitutional requirement that Parliament meet at least once every 12 months. And without Parliament to approve a budget and spending estimates, the government would run out of money.

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

""It was nice to get on the board tonight,"" said O'Reilly.

""I haven't been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it's just one game. I've got to be consistent with it.""

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

""When we take care of the puck it's effective and it's hard on them,"" said O'Reilly.

""I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We've got to stick to our structure.""

Pietrangelo said they've been working on fixing the penalty kill.

""We've been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,"" he said.

""Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.""

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

""They're blocking a lot of shots, they're studying us. They kind of know what we're doing,"" said Miller.

He said they'll make adjustments but aren't going to go back to square one.

""We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,"" he said.

""It's not like we're getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They're a good team. We're a good team. It's going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.""

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O'Reilly, last year's Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play — the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O'Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O'Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler's stick and in.

O'Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

All Western Conference games are being played in front of no fans at Rogers Place. The players are being kept isolated in a so-called bubble between games to prevent contracting COVID-19.

They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club.","TORONTO — Richard Clune remembers the drive — the pain, the anxiety, the uncertainty, the fear.

It was the spring of 2010 and Clune, who had made his NHL debut earlier that season, was finally on the road to getting the help the 23-year-old knew he needed in his crippling addiction battle.

article continues below

With his younger brother, Matt, at the wheel, they drove through upstate New York in a torrential downpour home to Toronto. Clune wasn't sure he was going to make it.

""I was in the acute withdrawal phase,"" he said in a recent interview with The Canadian Press. ""I couldn't sit still for a second. The most logical thing at that point in time for me was to go jump off a bridge ... literally.

""I couldn't really see myself coming out of it.""

But come out of it he did, and a decade later, Clune is sharing his story in ""Hi, My Name is Dicky,"" a raw documentary available on iTunes and AppleTV that details his life from aspiring youth hockey player to out-of-control junior antagonist to pro athlete teetering on the edge — one consumed by drugs, alcohol and mental illness.

His journey to recovery started in earnest on that lonely stretch of highway.

""My brother really had to talk me off the ledge,"" Clune said. ""When I see his face and when I see my other brother Ben's face, that's what gave me strength to live, because I didn't really want to live for myself at that time.

""Matt, at a couple points on that drive, had to do things that no younger brother should have to do and really dig down deep and get me home.""

The documentary from Taylor Prestidge and Haris Usanovic of Upper Canada Films tracks Clune's life and career, recovery and redemption. It includes interviews with Clune's parents, brothers, teammates and coaches.

Clune was driven to be the best as a child, but the pressure led him down a dark path at early age.

""I made that decision I was going to put my head down and not see anything but being a hockey player,"" Clune, who was selected in the third round of the 2005 NHL draft by the Dallas Stars, says in the film.

He began to try alcohol in his early teens as a way to cope, and it escalated quickly once he got to high school and then the Ontario Hockey League.

""I had this hole inside me that made me insecure and afraid of the world,"" Clune recounts. ""I got wasted and was like, 'Wow. OK. I'll be able to do this. I can cope with this. It's like a warm blanket.'

""Alcohol saved me. It was my solution to that problem of being self-absorbed and focused on all the things that made me insecure and self-conscious and in pain and sad.""

But he didn't realize how much of a spiral his life was taking. In junior, he would drive from bar to bar, party to party, drinking, smoking marjiuana and doing cocaine.

""I wanted to walk that line of looking death in the face every day, but still play hockey and do all these things,"" Clune says in the film. ""I don't know how I did it.""

Things got worse after junior when he was living in the United States by himself before making his NHL debut in that fateful 2009-10 season, months before becoming completely unglued.

""I had achieved my goal,"" he recalls on screen. ""But I hated myself.""

Clune eventually checked into rehab a second time — he went once before, but didn't stay — and committed to getting better with a lot of help from the people around him.

After he got out, he resumed his career and went onto play a total of 120 regular-season games in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Nashville Predators. His contract was bought out in 2015, and he was again at a crossroads — retire or keep going.

That's when the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were in the early stages of their massive rebuild, came calling to see if Clune wanted to be part of their program. They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club. At the very least, he would play in the minors and help foster a new culture.

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, who was in charge of the minor-league Marlies at the time, saw something in Clune that could be useful.

""He provides a certain energy,"" Dubas said. ""He provides experience in his life that I thought brought a great spirit to our team.""

Clune played 19 games with Leafs, but the forward truly made his mark with the Marlies. He helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018 and plans to continue his on-ice career, but equally important was how he's helped mentor a number of current NHLers.

He's proud of where he is, and not shy talking about how he got there. Clune still goes to meetings, does the 12 steps and now works to help others.

He also thinks a lot about why he made the decision to live, to fight, and get better, when many others — including some fellow pro hockey players — have gone down a different path.

""In the beginning, it was because I wanted to see my brothers,"" said Clune, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Then it transformed into wanting to live for myself. I started to discover what it feels like to have self esteem and to have love.

""I just hope people realize that they're not alone with how they feel. Don't be afraid to ask for help.""

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

article continues below

""After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,"" Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal's three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first overall by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

""A low-maintenance superstar,"" said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg's senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At five foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn't blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack of getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday. ""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League. I think it was Dale's arrival that really cemented the future of the franchise and I think we all have recollections of that first year, that Calder (Trophy) year and then everything that would follow.

""He was truly a superstar as a hockey player, but I think why he was so loved here was not just that but largely the fact that he made this his home and became one of us. I think everybody shared that sense of pride in Dale's career as a player.""

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: ""All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL's all time greatest players.""

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

""What an incredible human being,"" Selanne tweeted.

Montreal Canadiens associate coach Kirk Muller also had a chance to speak with Hawerchuk in recent days.

""I talked to Dale a few days ago, and we had a good chance to chat. A good friend, had a real good opportunity to play against one of the all-time best players. As a hockey player, we all know how great he was, but he was a good friend and just a really special person, did a lot for charities. It's a real loss for us in the hockey world.""

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk ""one of the most decorated players in our game's history.""

In September 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

""For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I'm ready to fight it,"" he told TSN in October 2019. ""I want to live to tell the story.""

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie's bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames players Andrew Mangiapane and Rasmus Andersson remembered playing for Hawerchuk in Barrie.

""I don't know where I'd be without him,"" said Mangiapane. ""Very sad news today. I owe my career basically to him and the whole Barrie organization.""

Andersson, from Sweden, said ""Dale was a fantastic human being. Such a great person. My first week in Barrie he invited us over to his house and really just welcomed me to Canada. I cannot say enough good things about him as a person. Obviously a real good coach, too.""

""It's awful news.""

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday's opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at age two and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur's record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

""I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive — well maybe a little further now with the traffic,"" he said. ""I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""

""I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,"" he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and '81 with teammates that included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL's top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt like he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year — the youngest recipient at the time — and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

""Just one of the greatest. You could tell from day one. We knew from when he was 18 years old as a player that he would turn the (Jets) franchise around. Certainly one of the best I’ve ever played with and coached,"" said Dallas Stars coach Rick Bowness, who played with and coached Hawerchuk in the '80s.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

""He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,"" said Mike Doran, Winnipeg's director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the faceoff in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux's famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

""It turned out fantastic,"" said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada's call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets ""are etched in my mind every day that I live.""

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes' ring of honour.

Hawerchuk re-wrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia whom he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

""It's like going back down memory lane,"" he said in his induction speech.

""All the experiences have been fantastic,"" he added. ""I mean, sometimes they didn't feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing ... Even though I didn't win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn't change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.""

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets' Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November 2017.

""Tonight we fly Ducky's number high,"" said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue's ""Home Sweet Home,"" before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

""Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,"" said the PA announcer.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

""I've been to every part of (Manitoba), either golfing or playing (softball),"" Hawerchuk said. ""I've gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I'm honoured and I'm very humbled.""

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.

And that includes how to allow players under contract to CFL teams the ability to sign elsewhere — most notably the NFL — if the opportunity arises. On Monday, the CFL cancelled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The focus right now for us on a few certain things and one of them is ensuring if there's an ability for our players to receive some form of payment this year,"" Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA's executive director, said Monday during a conference call. ""They should be able to do that if they have an opportunity.""

While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season. However, 66 players have currently opted out of participating in the 2020 campaign, which could create opportunity for some CFL players to sign deals south of the border and have a chance to earn a football paycheque, either on the active roster or on the practice squad.

While there's no shortage of collegiate players available, the advantage a CFL player has is pro experience, a fact not lost upon NFL personnel people.

The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign. This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.

And players on NFL practice rosters receive at least US$8,000 per week.

Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the CFL is amendable to doing what it can to help its players.

""Where we can do something we will,"" he said. ""We're going to be committed to working towards good outcomes, the best possible outcomes we can have with out players.

""That's not going to mean we're going to be able to do everything but we're certainly going to go into this with a real positive spirit.""

Something else that will be on the CFL-CFLPA radar will be the current collective bargaining agreement, which is slated to expire after the 2021 season. But union president Solomon Elimimian said the two sides covered a lot of ground this time around during talks to amend the agreement for a shortened '20 season.

""Whether we deal with '21 when it comes or after the '21 season I think there's hope there that we can work together,"" Elimimian said. ""Obviously the relationship between the players and the league needs to be one where the players feel appreciated.

""Everyone wants to the league to reach its full potential. The partnership has to be one that's very genuine and the players have to feel part of that. If that happens, the sky is the limit.""

Cavan Biggio also went deep for the Blue Jays and finished with three hits and three RBIs.

Ryu (2-1) struck out three and walked none. The left-hander permitted only one runner past second base and yielded just one extra-base hit to a team that came in ranked second in the majors with a .467 slugging percentage.

Rather than vie for strikeouts, Ryu said he was focused more on getting the Orioles to hit the ball weakly.

""I was able to keep them off balance,"" he said through an interpreter.

Signed in December to an $80 million, four-year contract, Ryu got off to a shaky start with Toronto in July before showing the form he displayed as a star with the Dodgers. He's given up a total of two runs in his last three starts after allowing eight runs over nine innings in his first two outings.

""That was vintage Ryu,"" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. ""Ryu was outstanding. That's the reason we won the game.""

The two home runs were a factor, but mostly Ryu was the difference-maker.

""They didn’t give Ryu that big contract for nothing,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""You just never know what he’s going to throw. You don’t know what side of the plate he’s going to throw to. He’s really tough on right-handers because he can locate it in. You saw a lot of us get jammed.""

The Blue Jays took control with a four-run third against Alex Cobb (1-2). Three infield hits produced a run before Grichuk delivered a three-run drive over the centre-field wall. It was his third home run of the season, all in the last four games.

""Obviously, the pitch to Grichuk was middle middle and it was a poorly executed pitch,"" Cobb said. ""But most of the pitches that I had, I felt like I executed. I got the results.""

Cobb gave up five runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He’s winless in his last four starts.

After hitting 31 homers last year, Grichuk was batting fifth, sixth or seventh in the order this season before Montoyo decided to move him into the No. 2 spot Sunday to replace injured Bo Bichette. Over the past two games, Grichuk has two homers, four hits and six RBIs.

Pedro Severino and Renato Núñez had RBIs for the Orioles, who have dropped two straight after winning seven of eight.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Bichette (right knee sprain) had an MRI and will receive a second opinion on his injury, Montoyo said. Bichette leads Toronto with a .361 batting average.

Orioles: RH Dillon Tate (elbow contusion) came off the injured list and RH Evan Phillips was optioned to the team's alternate site.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: RH Nate Pearson (0-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his fourth start in his first big league season Tuesday night. Drafted 28th overall in 2017, the 23-year-old is looking to rebound after giving up four runs to Miami last week in 2 1/3 innings. ""I'm developing at the highest level,"" Pearson said Monday. ""When I don't have my best stuff, I'm going to struggle.""

Orioles: LH Wade LeBlanc (1-0, 7.13) has allowed a combined 10 runs over 12 innings in his last three starts.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

""We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,"" Marchand said. ""That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.""

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

""We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do — little battles,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.""

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President's Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk's first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy's hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina's captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy putaway from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston's first six post-season games.

""There's other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.""

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen's late goal.

""That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,"" Williams said. ""We got it handed to us.""

NOTES: David Pastrnak had a goal and an assist in Boston’s double-overtime win in Game 1, but hasn’t played since. He had 48 regular-season goals to tie Washington’s Alex Ovechkin for the league lead. … Carolina played without 20-year-old Andrei Svechnikov, who was injured when his leg twisted awkwardly beneath him late in the third period of Saturday's loss. ... DeBrusk scored his 12th and 13th playoff goals since his 2018 post-season debut. … The Hurricanes were also without D Joel Edmundson for the third straight game. … Jake Gardiner assisted on Williams’ first-period goal for his first post-season point with Carolina.

Wale Road and the Island Highway is a non-right-angle intersection.
Steve Wallace is the owner of Wallace Driving School on Vancouver Island.","It is difficult to explain the reason for some intersections on Vancouver Island making the top 10 most dangerous crash list for 2019.

The 101 crashes at the almost completed McKenzie and Highway 1 project is somewhat predictable, but still a little odd. One would think the increased scrutiny throughout the construction phase would be cause for pause. The sheer volume of traffic of all types must have something to do with it.

article continues below

The McKenzie-Highway 17 (Pat Bay Highway) merge area is No. 2 on the list, with 68 crashes. There are some not so obvious differences in this seemingly simple configuration. It is really a double merge and therefore not just a single lateral move that drivers must negotiate when heading west and entering from McKenzie.

The third highest number of crashes are at the Boleskine and Douglas intersection. This location has been a perennial top 10 contender. It is really the Highway 1 corridor with 62 crashes, but is rather seen to be a city street, as opposed to a provincial responsibility. Left-turn cheaters and a far-lane timing move might be the cause of so many incidents at a very standard type of intersection.

Sixty-one crashes were recorded at the five-headed monster, better known as the Hillside-Douglas-Gorge intersection. This is also a perennial placer in the not-where-you-want-to-be category. Let us all hope this returns to a giant traffic circle, asap, as in days long since gone by.

At least everyone would be going the same direction, eliminating the requirement for a left turn and the potential dreaded head-on collision.

Millstream and the Trans-Canada highway takes a tie for fourth (61) as a relative newcomer to the yearly tally. Westshore makes the big time, in a not-so-envious way. This is partly because of the amazing development as of late. It is possibly the fastest-growing place in Canada. The outsiders looking for a big-box fix can probably be blamed for the entry into the top 10 bumper-car type of collisions.

The sixth most common crash site is a mystery to me. After moving the bus stop at the Pat Bay Highway and Sayward Road, it was believed all was well in hand. The crash rate was significantly reduced, and we all thought this location would never again darken these pages. Well, it only took a few years and here we go again. The crash incidences at this location not only defy logic, but also make a mockery of the large capital expense thought to have solved the problem. Blame it on ferry traffic! Maybe visitors! Who knows?

No. 7 is a golf shot from No. 3. Blanshard and Saanich is an odd member of the top 10. It is a one-way location of Highway 17. One-way street locations are generally safer places. This one stumps me, unless it is once again the fault of the left-turn cheaters turning from Saanich.

Nos. 8 and 9 are in Nanaimo, namely the Island Highway at Bowen and at Mostar. Of all the disappointing locations to make the list, these two are the most difficult to understand.

They are on the same bypass road. Left-turn lunacy? Non-synchronized traffic lights? This is a total mystery to me. I am stumped. How about you? Wide open and lots of room! I never have any problems at these intersections.

No. 10 is a newcomer. Wale Road and the Island Highway is a non-right-angle intersection. What is it doing on the list? It just does not belong. Any thoughts?

Last week’s column about Richardson assumed the first iteration of a shared lane was the preferred option. This was incorrect. A non-through street barrier option was chosen instead, matched with two opposite flow lanes. Thanks to readers for pointing it out.

Alonso crashed in Turn 4 when his Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet dipped onto the concrete portion of the apron at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and sent the Spaniard into the retaining wall. His damaged car rolled onto pit lane for an early end to his afternoon.

Alonso was sixth on the speed chart when he crashed. He ended up ninth for the day.

""It is just the way it is,"" Alonso said. ""Fortunately it happened today and not on (race day). We will learn from this. Nothing we can do now and tomorrow we start again.""

Alonso is making his third attempt to win the final leg of motorsports' version of the Triple Crown. The two-time Formula One champion has victories in the Monaco Grand Prix and 24 Hours of Le Mans, with Indianapolis the only race missing from the trifecta.

He had a strong car in 2017 when he raced at Indianapolis for Andretti Autorsport but an engine failure ended his shot at victory. Alonso failed to qualify for the Indy 500 last year in an effort from McLaren.

He also crashed during Indy 500 practice last year and it contributed to the many setbacks the McLaren team had during its preparations. The McLaren backup car was not the proper shade of orange and Alonso lost valuable practice time as the colour was corrected.

Alonso's crash with just over 50 minutes remaining in Thursday's session was the first wreck since the track opened Wednesday for practice.

Meanwhile, five-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon topped the speed charts at the end of the day with a lap at 226.102 mph for Chip Ganassi Racing. He was followed by Takuma Sato at 225.693 and Marco Andretti at 225.249 mph as Honda's took the top three spots.

Conor Daly at 225.106 was fourth and the fastest Chevrolet.

James Hinchcliffe of Oakville, Ont., was 17th and Dalton Kellett of Stouffville, Ont., was 28th.

There is one more day of practice before qualifying, called ""Fast Friday"" as IndyCar gives teams a horsepower boost to increase speeds. Defending race winner Simon Pagenaud said Team Penske had a deliberate plan to work on handling Thursday and will worry about speed during Fast Friday practice.

""I have no interest in drafting and getting a big number out there,"" Pagenaud said. ""There's no interest for me to do that. I know I can win this race and I know what I need. That's more important than drafting and putting up a big number."""

Cole Pearn abruptly retired at the end of last year's NASCAR season after helping build one of the best teams in stock car racing. His life on the road cost him too much time with his young family and relocating from Colorado to North Carolina had limited their access to outdoor adventures.

They returned to his native Canada to operate Golden Alpine Holidays in British Columbia, a venture that has been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. Racing has also been scrambled, and when the Indianapolis 500 was moved from May to Aug. 23, one of the Ed Carpenter Racing engineers had a conflict.

It created an opening at Carpenter on Conor Daly's car. One of Carpenter's crew members had worked with Pearn before and the connection was made: Pearn, the crew chief of Martin Truex Jr.'s 2017 NASCAR championship season, would work the Indianapolis 500.

""They asked. It was like, ‘Yeah, why not?’"" said Pearn, who called the Indy 500 a bucket list event. ""It's hard when you race your whole life and just completely turn it all off. So it's kind of nice to scratch that itch at the same time.""

Daly, in his first day working with Pearn, was ninth fastest around Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The Chevrolet was even faster Thursday, when Daly briefly sat atop the speed chart before Takuma Sato bumped him down a spot. He ended the day fourth overall in speed.

""We made some really good changes overnight and Cole has an idea of what he wants to do. He's got an interesting way of working, he's like ‘Yep, I know exactly what I want to do,’"" Daly said. ""I really like communicating with him and I think we are vibing really well.""

Daly, making his seventh Indy 500 start, finished a career-best 10th in his hometown race last season while running for Andretti Autosport. A scrapper who has pieced together a full IndyCar season swapping between Carpenter for oval races and Carlin Racing for street and road course events, the 28-year-old Daly is trying to stabilize his career.

Daly will try to parlay a strong 500 into full-time work while relying on a part-time engineer in the 37-year-old Pearn.

""I’ve learned to just try to get along with everyone,"" Daly said. ""I’m a very trusting individual. Obviously, Cole has an incredible amount of experience in the racing world. Was a driver himself, as well. He knows what’s going on.""

Pearn's most noted success is in stock cars and a five-year stint as Truex's crew chief that produced 24 Cup Series victories. The team raced for the title three consecutive years, finishing second in back-to-back seasons after the 2017 championship.

Things began to change when Furniture Row Racing closed at the end of the 2018 season and Pearn and Truex were pulled into Joe Gibbs Racing. They won seven races and were runner-up to teammate Kyle Busch in the title race when Pearn decided he'd had enough.

He has since watched NASCAR on television and provides both insightful and comedic commentary on social media. Pearn recognized he missed racing.

""For sure missed the competition side,"" Pearn said. ""This is obviously a fully different experience, but racing is still racing. You throw a green and checkered.""

To prepare for Indy, Pearn took a very literal approach — ""I had to read the rule book,"" he said.

He's always followed IndyCar and his racing experience qualifies Pearn for the crossover that few expect will be a difficult transition.

""I grew up knowing these cars, it's not like it's anything crazy,"" Pearn said. ""In some regards it is kind of simple and it's just about understanding the procedures and how we set the cars up, learn how tech goes. The physics is honestly the easiest part, understanding how everything else works is the harder part.""

When Carpenter made the hire, he had no doubt bringing in Pearn would be seamless and give Daly a shot at winning the Indianapolis 500.

""I believe when you bring in smart and talented people that have a work ethic, they’re going to figure it out,"" Carpenter said. ""There’s a lot that’s different but a lot of the processes are the same. Some of the language is different. He’s definitely putting in the work to do it, getting prepared. A lot of what we’re doing at Indy is making decisions in the moment. I think we all feel like Cole has those traits."""

""We'll be asking our employees to work with us to help shape this new reality together,"" said spokeswoman Rose Pao in a statement.

The negotiations will focus on collective agreements that expire Sept. 21. The union said that it will identify on Sept. 8 its ""strike target"" — the manufacturer it will target first to set a pattern for the other agreements.

Unifor national president Jerry Dias says he will be on the lookout for any attempts by the manufacturers to use COVID-19 as an ""excuse."" He says other than improving wage increases, he expects major battlegrounds will be a new product investment from Ford in Oakville, putting a stop to outsourcing Ford parts depots, and restoring the third shift in Fiat Chrysler's Windsor and Brampton facilities. Dias is also eyeing the 2023 expiration of major programs in GM's powertrain operation in St. Catharines.

While recent trade policy changes, when enacted, will improve the state of play, Dias says the government needs to do more to attract electric vehicle investments to Canada.

""This is an industry that pays a lot of taxes,"" says Dias. ""And it's a lot of jobs. So everybody's going to have to start to row together in the right direction.""

Ian Lee, associate professor of management at Sprott School of Business at Carleton University, says the economic pressure on the auto industry has created an uphill battle for unions.

""GM, Ford, FCA, I think they're increasingly in the driver's seat,"" says Lee.

""Unifor, in these upcoming negotiations, they're in the fight of their life. I think that there is not going to be so much on wages. I think it's going to be, 'Can we save the plants that are left?'""

The new round of negotiations come as the industry is still dealing with fallout from the novel coronavirus. For example, FCA plants in Canada were down from March 18 to May 4, and GM plants were closed between March 16 and May 25, after which they gradually reopened.

Like previous recessions, auto sales also sputtered during the early months of the COVID-19 outbreak. DesRosiers Automotive Consultants Inc. said that auto sales plunged 48 per cent year-over-year in March, but by July, sales had fallen just 4.9 per cent, the smallest decrease since the pandemic began.

Nonetheless, DesRosiers predicted that annual sales rates will remain flat for one to two years.

The new negotiations will be set against the background of the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which went into force July 1.

The deal included a provision that a significant percentage of the value of a car be produced by workers earning the equivalent of at least US$16 per hour, something the Canadian government said could improve Canadian automotive manufacturing's competitiveness compared to that of Mexico.

While some trade policy changes, when enacted, will improve the state of play, Dias says the government needs to do more to attract electric vehicle investments to Canada.

""This is an industry that pays a lot of taxes,"" says Dias. ""And it's a lot of jobs. So everybody's going to have to start to row together in the right direction.""

Between 1999 and 2017, Canada dropped to the No. 10 auto manufacturing country in the world, down from No. 4 in 1999, Unifor previously estimated.

""Mexico is building smaller cars, in a threat to Canada. But I've argued that the biggest threat to Canada is not Mexico. It's the southern United States,"" says Lee.

""In the American South, it's not only wages that are lower ... taxes are lower, state taxes are lower, land costs are lower, cost of living is lower.""

In 2016, GM was targeted by the union, which cited the company's financial surplus and asked for new allocations for vehicles and powertrain and better incentives for new hires and retirees.

The agreements, which can be hundreds of pages in length, ended up converting 700 jobs at GM and securing a $713-million investment and 500 jobs from Ford, among other issues.

Last year marked the culmination of downsizing at a GM plant in Oshawa, Ont. The plant east of Toronto now has about 300 workers, down from about 2,600.

""There's going to be a great temptation for the three companies: When they close down these particular cars as a segment, they will not replace them. If you don't replace them, you close up a plant,"" says Lee.

GM, in a motion last week, alleged that Fiat Chrysler used foreign bank accounts to bribe union officials so they would stick GM with higher labour costs.

But in a response, the Italian-American automaker fired back, calling GM’s claims ""defamatory and baseless.""

GM alleged in its motion that FCA spent millions on bribes by stashing the money in foreign accounts. The assertion that there is new evidence came as GM asked a federal judge to reconsider his July dismissal of a federal racketeering lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler.

In trying to revive the lawsuit, GM alleged that bribes were paid to two former United Auto Workers presidents, as well as a former union vice-president and at least one former GM employee.

In its response, Fiat Chrysler said the judge should deny GM's motion. GM, FCA said, has to know that the prospect of getting the judge to overturn the dismissal is slim to none. ""So this motion is apparently a vehicle to make more defamatory and baseless accusations about a competitor that is winning in the marketplace.""

FCA denied allegations by GM that FCA paid two ""moles"" to infiltrate GM and send inside information. The company also denied that foreign bank accounts were involved. ""That GM has extended its attacks to individual FCA officers and employees, making wild allegations against them without a shred of factual support, is despicable,"" FCA lawyers wrote.

GM's claims are based on the alleged existence of foreign bank accounts, which are legal, Fiat Chrysler wrote. ""There is not one well-pled allegation in the proposed amended complaint (by GM) that these foreign bank accounts were used to pay bribes or facilitate any other illegal conduct,"" FCA's response said.

GM contends that bribes were paid to former United Auto Workers Presidents Dennis Williams and Ron Gettelfinger, as well as Vice-President Joe Ashton. It also alleges money was paid to GM employees including Al Iacobelli, a former FCA labour negotiator who was hired and later released by GM.

GM alleges that payments were made so the officials would saddle GM with more than $1 billion in additional labour costs.

Gettelfinger, whose name had not come up previously in a wide-ranging federal probe of UAW corruption, vehemently denied the allegations in a statement and said he had no foreign accounts. Williams’ California home was raided by federal agents but he has not been charged. Iacobelli, who is awaiting sentencing in the probe, also denied the claims.

In July, U.S. District Judge Paul Borman in Detroit tossed out GM’s lawsuit that alleged that Fiat Chrysler paid off union leaders to get better contract terms than GM.

He wrote that GM’s alleged injuries were not caused by FCA violating federal racketeering laws, and that the people harmed by the bribery scheme were Fiat Chrysler workers.

GM’s motion contended that payments were made to accounts in places like Switzerland, Luxembourg, Italy, Singapore and the Cayman Islands. The accounts were set up to avoid detection in the federal criminal probe, according to the motion. The accounts were discovered recently by private investigators working on GM’s behalf, according to court records."

The attractive four-passenger two-door sportster set a first model year sales record of 680,989, admittedly a long one that ran from April ’64 to August ’65. It caught the competition so off guard it took rival Chevrolet until the 1967 model year to respond with its Camaro.

The Mustang made Ford’s general manager Lee Iacocca a household name and put his picture on the cover of both Time and Newsweek. It also spawned a class of vehicle known as the Pony Car.

As inevitably seems to happen, the Mustang grew bigger and heavier. By 1973 it was about 305 millimetres longer, 152 mm wider and about 272 kilograms heavier than the original.

The Mustang had outgrown its original appeal as an affordable, nimble sporty car. As Iacocca summed up: “The Mustang market never left us, we left it.”

Sales confirmed this, sliding from more than 600,000 in model year 1966, to just 134,267 in 1973. What’s more, new, lighter, imported 2+2 mini-Pony Cars combining four-on-the-floor fun with upscale luxury were becoming increasingly popular. They were filling the segment Mustang had created and gradually abandoned.

Cars such as the Toyota Celica and Ford’s own German Capri (sold by Lincoln-Mercury dealers, and ironically inspired by the original Mustang), were the stimulus for a new, smaller Mustang to try recapturing the earlier magic.

Plans for the trimmer 1974 Mustang began in 1970, and just as the original was based on mundane Falcon components, the new one used the new-for-1971 subcompact Ford Pinto as its foundation. This complete departure was called the Mustang II.

Iacocca specified a wheelbase of 2,438 to 2,540 mm in notchback and fastback coupes. This precluded using a long engine, so a 2.3-litre, overhead cam inline four was the base power with a 2.8- litre, overhead valve V-6 optional, and standard in the upscale Mustang II Mach I. The four was the U.S.-built Pinto engine while the option was a stretch of the Capri’s 2.6 litre V-6 from Germany.

Ford’s engineers took downsizing seriously and made the Mustang II even smaller than the original. The wheelbase was reduced from 2,743 mm to 2,443 mm and ove-all length from 4,613 mm to 4,445 mm. It was a full 508 mm shorter and 102 mm narrower than the bloated ’73 model it replaced.

In spite of its smaller size, mandated safety and emission equipment brought the unit construction Mustang II’s weighy to 1,270 kg, a little heavier than the original’s 1,179 kg.

The attractive styling was influenced by coachbuilder Ghia of Italy, recently acquired by Ford, and carried on the long-hood, short-deck theme of the original. It came as a notchback and hatch-equipped fastback.

The Mustang II was no match for the original’s performance. Road & Track (8/64) reported the original 4.7 litre (289 cu in.) V-8 Mustang sprinted to 97 km/h (60 mph) in 9.0 seconds and had a top speed of 177 (110).

The Mustang II Mach I with the 2.8 litre V-6 (R&T 9/73) ran zero to 97 (60) in 13.8 seconds with top speed of 161 (100). The four was, of course, even slower.

When Ford advertised the new 1974 Mustang as “The right car at the right time,” they couldn’t have known how prescient they would be. In November 1973, conditions changed dramatically when the Arab oil embargo precipitated the first of two 1970s “energy crises.”

Not only did gasoline prices spike but its supply was rumoured to be in jeopardy. Fuel economy immediately became the hot item and helped boost the smaller Mustang’s first calendar year sales to 385,993.

With oil crisis memories fading by 1975, Ford offered a 5.0-litre V-8 in the Mustang II, bringing performance closer to the original’s. R&T (1/75) recorded zero to 97 km/h (60 mph) in 10.5 seconds and top speed of 171 (106).

A Cobra II with options such as extra trim, black grille, front air dam and rear spoiler came in 1976. There was also a Stallion package with different paint treatment and stallion decals on the front fenders. For 1978 there was the even more garish King Cobra with standard 5.0-litre V-8, deeper air dam, stripes and a cobra decal on the hood.

The Mustang II was built through the 1978 model year, then replaced by the 1979 Fairmont-based, third-generation Mustang. Many Mustang enthusiasts disdained the Mustang II as a wimpy aberration, not a “real” Mustang. It was, however, a product of its time and became a desirable collectible for many."

Dysfunction-By-The-Sea is truly a place in Backward Columbia. Try Suicide Lanes by the Sea. Yes, the City of Victoria seems to want to solve problems that do not exist. Longtime residents of Victoria can remember the giant traffic circle at the Douglas-Hillside-Gorge intersection. According to those who are still alive, it worked very well. Traffic flowed in one direction, eliminating the dreaded head-on and T-bone crash potential. This functioning roundabout was replaced with a brand-new toy, signalized traffic lights. Proving once again you can always tell an engineer, but not very much. Giving up on a proven technology in favour of an unproven new toy is their eternal fault. Their heralded advancements are much appreciated, but every so often, they overreach. Frankly, we cannot live without engineers, but every so often, we could do without their shiny new toy.

article continues below

The ultra-brand-new toy is the shared lane insanity about to be hoisted upon an unsuspecting commuting public.

The one-block trial, where a single lane, referred to as a Suicide lane in the old days, is intended to serve opposite motor vehicle directional travel. Once a driver comes face-to-face with another car driver in the single provided road lane, it is expected that each would swerve right. This action takes the drivers into the well-marked, same direction, painted bike lanes on each side of the street.

By the way, bike riders are not restricted to these well-marked bike lanes. Drivers will not only have to make a right shoulder check before moving right from the suicide lane, but also check their left shoulder before returning to the suicide lane, since bike riders are not restricted to bike lanes.

I have nothing against bikes. I like bike riders. The more bike riders, the fewer cars needed to get from A to B. This odd new toy will be especially difficult for visitors to our city. Who in their right mind, would choose a city block, with a major hotel complex, to do a first run of this unnecessary matrix? What do visitors to the hotel think? Is this block of Humboldt street a high crash site? Is it the location of fatal crashes?

Richardson Avenue is another future disaster in the making. The plan is to do the same configuration on this commuter arterial. Crash rates and vehicle volume do not justify the proposed suicide-lane modifications. Residents are up in arms and cyclists are not of one mind when it comes to these revolutionary changes.

• If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it! This phrase comes to mind when referencing not only Richardson, but also Vancouver street. Richardson is a connector street, and a low stress way to get to and from the Tweed Curtain, known as Oak Bay. The death rate on Richardson must be astronomically high for such changes to be proposed. It is not!

The Vancouver Street directional changes are different than others referenced. The plan is to do major capital expense, namely concrete and stationary construction, in order to physically block and re-route motor vehicle traffic. Vancouver Street will no longer be a through street for motor vehicles. The 4,000 to 5,000 vehicles using the street will be diverted to Quadra or Cook. These streets are already stressed during morning and afternoon commutes.

Why are any of these projects being considered at this time of municipal financial crisis?

City council would be wise to delay in this time of a never before experienced financially stressful pandemic.

In a space of days, we’ve gone from confronting COVID-19 to confronting the effects of racism and discrimination throughout our society.

article continues below

We’ve seen how physical and verbal abuse damages and ends lives. But the movement on the streets, online and among work communities is bringing attention to how quiet behaviour and attitudes — intentional, thoughtless, or unknowing and unaware — can cause similar and often hidden harm.

A couple of weeks ago, we were talking about how the pandemic shutdowns provided an opportunity to reorder the world intentionally as part of the post-health-crisis restart. Many people saw that we could use the reopening of economies to address major problems and concerns faced by society and the world.

The restrictions exposed the cracks in our society, the fractures among our families, and the flaws in many of our systems. When so many parts of the world shut down, the weaknesses in how our lives are structured could no longer be avoided. Domestic abuse, mental health, homelessness, lack of support for seniors, young adults and young families, and the precarious nature of much work deemed essential yet done by some of the most poorly paid among us — these problems have long existed but are usually plastered and painted over, like mould in a building.

It took closing businesses, schools and offices, a nosediving economy, and hospitals and health-care workers standing by for a potential flood of COVID-19 cases such as Italy, France, Seattle and New York City saw to make us stop and pay attention.

And when we did, the problems stared right back at us.

As the pandemic unfolded, some problems were acknowledged. Some were temporarily addressed. Some employers of essential services topped up the wages of their front-line workers. Governments have stepped in with emergency-response programs to help individuals, businesses, non-profit agencies and industries. Changes to how work is conducted were mandated to keep people safe.

Those are only the problems that became most obvious when the shutdown occurred. With time, the existence of other problems — as persistent, but long shoved deeper into the flawed structure of our society — have emerged.

As many of the protesters have noted over the last couple of weeks, Canada has its own shameful past regarding racism. We carry the infamy of past harms — smallpox-infected blankets distributed to Indigenous peoples, residential schools, the segregation of black children in Ontario schools in the 1800s, the Komagata Maru, the turning away of non-white, non-Christian refugees during the Second World War, Saskatoon’s “starlight tours,” whereby city police dropped off intoxicated First Nations membersway out in the countryside to “walk it off,” even in deep winter … and the list goes on.

But just as the past few months have exposed other unpleasant truths about Canadian society, they have also revealed that racism resides just below Canadian society’s polite surface.

The recent attacks on people of Asian heritage in the Lower Mainland, the shooting of Chantel Moore, the beating of Chief Allan Adam and the death of Regis Korchinski Paquet belie the lies we tell ourselves. These are overt acts. They’re easier to spot and address.

The people whose attitudes have silently seeped into society for years rarely make the news. Those attitudes are much harder to expose and change. Whether we’re aware of and acknowledge our biases and prejudices or are oblivious to them, the harm we cause with them is just as real. Nobody has a right to make others feel unsafe and unwelcome in the communities they call home, the workplaces they are part of, the schools they attend, and the professions they contribute to.

Now that these uncomfortable truths are in the open, enough is enough — it’s time to deal with them and make a better world. For all peoples.

Since 1958, there have been 140 lunar missions, some intended to encircle the moon, others to land on it. Roughly half failed on lift-off or in flight, and nearly all of the remainder were, for the most part, trial runs aimed at developing more reliable technologies.

The issue revolves around diminishing marginal returns, the idea being that the more often you attempt a venture, relatively speaking the less you stand to gain.

That wouldn’t be true if all of the moon-shots so far had failed. In that case, it would still be worth another try.

But six manned missions (all American) have landed on the surface and returned safely. What is to be gained by a seventh, considering the miserable failure rates to date?

It’s been suggested that the moon could be mined for minerals that might in turn be processed on site as fuel for missions further afield.

No doubt one day this might be practical. But by 2024? Not a chance.

This is merely another placeholder in case Congress shuts down the space program completely.

The more obvious target is Mars. A recent stream of data from orbiters and landers, as well as Earth-based telescopes, has shown that without question water remains on that planet. Most of it will be underground — the atmosphere has burned off to such a degree that liquids don’t survive long on the surface.

Even so, there are photographs of water trickling down the sides of craters in the polar region.

To date, the robot landers sent to Mars have been miserably limited in nature. Their ability to search beneath the surface extends to only a few centimetres.

Clearly, that won’t do. If there is life on the red planet — the main reason for going there — it is likely to be far underground, possibly in subterranean caverns.

But the rovers sent to Mars have no chance of reaching these. At best they can test for atmospheric gases that might, conceivably, suggest the presence of living organisms.

And the emphasis here is on “conceivably.” There are numerous alternate explanations that skeptics will point to.

We’ve been conducting radio searches across various sectors of the galaxy since the late 1950s, looking for signs that someone is out there. So far, we’ve found nothing. Not that this has disheartened SETI researchers, who like NASA, need an excuse to stay in business.

The only realistic means of proving we are not alone in the universe is to visit the one planet in the solar system that has both a history of life-sustaining conditions, and which is within the reach of a manned expedition (if only just).

There is no question about the difficulties or risks involved. Given current rates of acceleration, it will take a ship about seven months to reach Mars, and the same to get back.

That’s a long time in a gravity-less environment. You could perhaps spin the ship to create the equivalent of gravity, as was done with the fictional Soviet spacecraft Leonov in the movie 2010.

But no-one knows the effect this would have on the human body over an extended period.

Then there is an unavoidable wait of 18 months on the planet’s surface until the Earth orbits back into the proper position. But the average temperature is -63 C, and radiation levels (again due to the thin atmosphere) are far above the lethal level. We’re talking mammoth hazmat suits.

Nevertheless, if we’re going to face the risks that manned space travel involves, we might as well do so for a purpose worth pursuing. Proof that we are not alone (and I’m betting that’s what such a mission would show), is the only purpose that meets this test.

However, you might feel you are facing more uncertainties in the current climate than normal, so this is a good time for both some good news and some not-so-good news about what the future might hold, career-wise.

But first, the bad news. You’d be justified in some level of anxiety about the future if you have plans never to darken the doorway of some kind of classroom again.

Recent graduates who enter the labour force straight out of high school are not faring as well as previous generations. That’s partly because 88 per cent of working-age Canadians have already graduated from high school and the competition for jobs which require only high school graduation is fierce.

The better news is that Canadian high-school graduates who pursue some level of post-secondary education or training do much better financially in the long run.

But as a Grade 12 grad, you probably already know all that. The somewhat more hopeful news is that baby boomers now make up Canada’s largest demographic group, and many are nearing retirement.

According to Statistics Canada, the baby-boomer generation made up almost 26 per cent of the population in 2018. And by 2024, one in five Canadians will be 65 or older.

That means many job opportunities could become available for younger Canadians who still have all or most of their careers ahead of them.

That’s an encouraging prospect for this year’s Grade 12 grads, but just as important as increasing job availability will be, according to the Conference Board of Canada, the kind of flexibility that some form of post-secondary education offers.

If current trends continue, Canadians can expect to hold as many 15 jobs, sometimes on different career paths and sometimes as variations of the original career direction.

A survey of 4,000 Canadians in September and October last year found that only six per cent of people have held just one job in their career, while 16 per cent said that they had already held more than 10.

Times have changed since previous generations posted a qualification and then worked in the same career all their lives. Job security, benefits and pensions defined their decision not to branch out.

So the not-so-good news for high school grads who think it’s all over is that their education is not over by far.

There is a growing consensus among employers that high-school completion is simply the prerequisite, a first step to post-secondary education of some kind.

A post-secondary qualification of some kind, even if it does not apply specifically to a job, is now deemed essential to success in a wide variety of labour-market opportunities.

Again, according to StatCan and other people who keep track of employment trends, most Canadians don’t think they will stay in the same line of work for their entire career.

In a survey of more than 1,000 people, nearly 73 per cent said that they do not expect to remain in the same profession for life. The most common reasons people gave for changing career paths range from discovering a new opportunities they have become passionate about (35 per cent), becoming bored/disillusioned with their original work (24 per cent), and a variety of setbacks, real or imagined, such as lack of advancement and cutbacks in times like these that result in layoffs (19 per cent).

That at least takes some pressure off the immediate decision to commit to a lifelong career direction.

Beyond that, there is a long lineup of notable people, too many to mention here, who did not discover what they really wanted to do until somewhat later in life.

Andrea Bocelli began singing opera when he was 34 and Martha Stewart was 35 when she started her catering business in a friend’s basement. She was 42 when her first book of recipes was published.

J.K. Rowling was a divorced mother on public assistance before she created Harry Potter at age 35, and the list goes on.

None of this has anything to do with being a “late bloomer.” It is simply illustrative of the fact that the decisions that you, as a newly certificated Grade 12 graduate, make now might, or more likely might not, lead to a lifelong career.

But with some post-secondary qualifications, the variety of opportunities is probably better than ever before.

Obviously, I was worried about risks, and wanted to make the final decision with caution. As eager and excited as I was, and still am, to reopen parts of our lives and “our bubbles” to include other people, there is a leery feeling in doing so.

At first, I chatted with parents asking their thoughts about schools reopening and if they were going to send their kids. I’ll admit I felt a little outnumbered, as each parent I spoke with had no intention of sending their kids back to school. I was even wondering if was making the right decision.

I don’t think there is a right or wrong answer here, it’s about personal preferences and family circumstances. This is one of those topics that we need to respect people’s decisions and not try to sway them to stand with us.

We all need to make the best decisions for our families. Also, as schools are operating within a smaller capacity and limiting student numbers, it is actually great that there are some families who are willingly keeping their children home.

It’s been a couple of weeks since schools have reopened, and there have been many children returning to school. I wasn’t alone. At one point I pictured an empty school with my daughter sitting in a class with only her teacher.

My daughter has been in school twice a week and spends other days in child care with a small group of kids. This experience has been extremely positive, and she is almost an entirely new child. She comes home beaming with excitement and happiness. Honestly, her reaction to these outlets opened my eyes to the effects a couple of months in quarantine had on her.

I am grateful to the schools and child-care centres that are opening and offering children the support, activities and mental stimulation they need and crave.

Before sending my daughter to school, we talked about how things might be different and what she could expect. I was worried the changes might be hard to adjust to. There were news stories and letters sent to parents all addressing this.

When my daughter came home the first day, she didn’t mention any of it. Her updates were on her teacher, her friends, and what they were learning. This was another reminder to me on how resilient children are.

My daughter took the school bus for the first time in months and told me how great it was. I had to nearly pry it out of her that she has to use hand sanitizer to board and that the first few rows need to remain empty to give the bus driver space.

I found this interesting because as adults I think we are often focussing on what the changes are going to be and how they will affect us.

Interestingly, there are some things in place that my daughter did point out, such as having to wash her hands before and after she eats. Which is something we should all do, all the time. If this is a new practice that gets drilled into us a little bit more, it’s a good thing.

Many of us are starting to experience the opportunities of going back to school or returning to work, and there will be some big changes in doing so.

At my daughter’s school, she said there are arrows on the floor now, similar to grocery stores. This is something that I think we will continue to see in more places. I remember the first time I saw this on social media and, honestly, I didn’t think it would happen here. It goes to show how fast we are able to implement practices that keep people safe and how quickly we can all adapt to them.

Teachers have now seen their duties multiply, with not only educating children in the classroom, but creating and facilitating online learning, and then the added responsibilities of ensuring the students are adhering to physical distancing. It’s no easy task, and I want to thank all teachers, particularly my daughter’s teacher for stepping up to the challenge.

Chamber of Commerce and the Thriving Orcas, Thriving Communities Coalition (composed of a number of coastal communities’ chambers of commerce) warned that coastal communities are on the brink of extinction because they rely on recreational fishing, which is in jeopardy.

Part of their proposed strategy to protect the orca and the chinook salmon — and their livelihoods — is “predator control.”

article continues below

But just which predator is it that needs to be controlled? Ironically, two other reports released the same day made it clear; the chief predator is us. The first was a report from NatureServe Canada and the Nature Conservancy of Canada on the crisis facing endemic species — species that are found only in Canada. The second, released by the Sierra Club of B.C., was a report from three independent scientists on the state of B.C.’s old-growth forests.

The endemic species report identified 308 of them, most being vascular plants and invertebrates (bugs and slugs, if you like). In B.C. we have 105 of these endemic species, 76 of which are unique to B.C. (the rest overlap with other provinces or the United States), with many found only on Vancouver Island, Haida Gwaii and other islands. Ten of them are “critically imperilled” and 13 are “imperilled.” But this is only a small part of the picture.

There are more than 50,000 species of plants and animals in B.C., according to the Royal B.C. Museum — more than in any other province. Of them, 1,807 species are at risk of extinction, according to an opinion piece in The Narwhal last year by a group of prominent academics, most from B.C., who conduct research on endangered species. Overall, 784 species present in B.C. are “red-listed,” meaning they are extirpated, endangered, or threatened in B.C.

The lead researcher on the third report, on old-growth forests, was Dr. Rachel Holt, a conservation biologist and the principal of Veridian Ecological Consulting, based in Nelson. In the past she has served as vice-chair of the B.C. Forest Practices Board.

Shockingly, she and her colleagues found that “many old-growth management areas, created to protect old-growth forests, do not actually contain old forest,” but that “government information was either misleading or not making it out to the public,” hence their independent report. They agree with the information on the website of B.C.’s Old Growth Strategic Review (due to report about now) that old-growth forests comprise about 23 per cent of forested areas in B.C.

But the bulk of this old-growth forest, they write, is not the iconic old growth with big trees that we think of when we hear the term “old growth.” Instead, they report, “the vast majority of this forest (80 per cent) consists of small trees,” including “black spruce bog forests in the northeast, subalpine forests at high elevation and low-productivity western red cedar forests on the outer coast.”

In fact, they note: “Sites with the potential to grow very large trees cover less than three per cent of the province,” and of this small amount, only about three per cent is old forest. Large tree old-growth forest ecosystems, they say, “are almost extinguished and will not recover from logging.”

And yet, they note “little human effort is tasked with protecting old forest values, while much is focused on harvesting.” Similarly, the endangered species researchers note “B.C. is still one of the only provinces in Canada without legislation dedicated to protecting and recovering species at risk.”

The harsh reality is that communities that rely on the over-exploitation of natural systems such as old-growth forests or salmon fisheries, or that are affected by the actions of others that have seriously damaged those ecosystems, are indeed threatened with extinction, because their natural-resources base is heading for extinction.

So when we talk about predator control, let’s be clear what predator we are talking about. We are the planet’s apex predator, and so the predator we need to control is us. Because as the 19th-century Duwamish elder, Chief Seattle, is recorded saying: “We are part of the web of life, and whatever we do to the web of life, we do to ourselves.” We forget that wisdom at our peril.

thancock@uvic.caDr. Trevor Hancock is a retired professor and senior scholar at the University of Victoria’s School of Public Health and Social Policy.","Several years ago two American economists, Anne Case and Angus Deaton — the latter a Nobel Prize winner — made a startling observation: The overall death rate among middle-aged American whites had been increasing in recent years. This ran counter to the general trend of decreasing death rates in America in the 20th century and was opposite to the trend for middle-aged African Americans.

As they dug into the data, they found the increase in deaths was almost entirely found among those without a bachelor’s degree and was mostly due to three factors: suicide, drug overdoses and alcoholic liver disease. They labelled these the “deaths of despair,” a label that stuck. Clearly, something was going badly wrong among working-class white Americans.

article continues below

In their new book Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism, they provide an in-depth analysis of these diseases of despair. It is a story, they write, “of lives that have come apart and have lost their structure and significance.” It is a story “of worse jobs with lower wages; of declining marriage; and of declining religion.”

While they recognize there have been changes in values and social norms that have contributed to the breakdown, they focus on the “external forces that have eaten away the foundations that characterized working-class life as it was half a century ago.”

These include declining wages — down 13 per cent betweeen 1979 and 2017, while increasing overall nationally by 85 per cent; low rates of job creation for those without a degree and “worse jobs” — part-time, out-sourced, insecure, with no sense of belonging or pride.

The creation of worse jobs is made possible in part by the low level of unionization in the U.S. The Bureau of Labour Statistics reported 10.3 per cent of wage and salary workers were union members in 2019, down from 20.1 per cent in 1983. For comparison, OECD data for 2018 show rates for the five Nordic countries highlighted below ranged from 92 per cent in Iceland to 49 per cent in Norway; it is 26 per cent in Canada.

Case and Deaton note: “Deterioration in job quality and detachment from the labour force bring miseries over and above the loss of earnings.” For one thing, “men without prospects do not make good marriage partners.” Moreover, they note, communities deteriorate; as wages decline, jobs are lost and businesses close, the revenues needed to provide services such as schools, parks and libraries decline.

Add to that “the loss of meaning, of dignity and of self-respect that come with the loss of marriage and of community,” and you have a recipe for disaster.

Behind all this, I think, run two broad themes: The cult of individualism in the United States that downplays the importance of community and the collective, and neo-liberal economics, rooted in individualism and in a cynical disregard for people, prioritizing profits and the enriching of the wealthy.

Contrast this with the five Nordic countries, which ranked in the top 10 in the World Happiness Report every year since 2013, occupying the top three spots for three of the past four years. America, in comparison, ranked 18th in 2019. A chapter in the 2020 report is devoted to what makes the Nordic countries exceptional.

In essence, it’s a story of coming together, not coming apart. In general, the Nordic countries provide “easy access to relatively generous welfare benefits,” while “the labour market is regulated to avoid employee exploitation.” They also have high-quality governments and public institutions, with, in particular, a high quality of democracy, and as a result governments are trusted.

Other factors include low levels of inequality, a high sense of autonomy and freedom, and high levels of social trust and cohesion. In short, the Nordic countries have found a recipe for success, and it shows in the fact that on average they have four years more healthy life expectancy than the U.S.

America, it seems, has lost touch with the philosophy of one of its founders, Thomas Jefferson, who wrote in 1809 that “the care of human life and happiness and not their destruction is the first and only legitimate object of good government.” Creating despair among the poor while enriching the elites is utterly inconsistent with this view. Time for a rethink.

However, that might be only a temporary relief. So far, the outbreak has been largely confined, at least in its most lethal form, to the northern hemisphere.

article continues below

That was to be expected. Coronaviruses, flu among them, are often a winter phenomenon. It may be the virus is vulnerable to ultraviolet light that tends to be more prominent in the summer months.

But when winter returns to our hemisphere, are we in for a second round? Many experts believe so.

In that event, what should our policy be, and who should enunciate it? One explanation for the unprecedented measures employed so far has been that this was an emergency, the full consequences of which could not immediately be known. Extraordinary steps were therefore fully justified.

Hopefully, if the outbreak reappears in the fall, we will have better data to calibrate our response, and possibly a vaccine — though many experts believe the latter to be either improbable, or of limited value. The effectiveness of some flu vaccines has fallen below 20 per cent.

Yet the issue remains, who decides how such a recurrence should be handled. And this question grows in magnitude when we consider that decisions taken in the more prosperous northern hemisphere may devastate the southern half of the globe.

Winter is just now approaching that region. Africa and Middle and South America look especially vulnerable (New Zealand and Australia might escape the worst effects because both are islands. That might be one reason Vancouver Island has been less hard hit than parts of the mainland.)

You can begin to see a picture of what may happen if you look at the current death tolls per million population. In several northern countries, the fatality rates are in the hundreds per million.

There are some exceptions. China reports very low figures, but there are good reasons to disbelieve these numbers.

In contrast, many African and South American countries are so far reporting figures at or close to single digits. As I write this, Paraguay stands at 11 deaths per million population, Venezuela 10, Egypt 6.9, South Africa 6.4, Sudan 2.9, French Guiana 1.

Most of these are Third World countries. You can’t expect their reporting to be precise.

Yet what happens if these numbers climb to the levels experienced in Britain (552), Italy (544), France (424) and Belgium (inexplicably 815)? Brazil, with its huge, densely populated cities, is already in trouble.

How will we handle this? By offering those governments more foreign aid? Certainly.

However, most Western nations have gone heavily into debt to deal with their own crises. In the midst of a panic-inducing epidemic, could there ever be sufficient resources to aid two entire continents whose populations approach 2.5 billion?

Given the success of public health experts such as B.C.’s Dr. Bonnie Henry in limiting the outbreak, this may appear an ungenerous question. But if, as many experts have predicted, COVID-19 makes a comeback in the fall, should we continue using the same policies to handle the crisis? For these measures have wider implications.

Difficult as it is to assimilate in the midst of a pandemic, the United Nations has warned that “hundreds of thousands of children could die this year due to the global economic downturn sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, and tens of millions more could fall into extreme poverty as a result of the crisis.”

This would undercut many of the gains made in reducing world poverty over the past two decades.

The International Monetary Fund has said that as a result of the COVID lockdown, “the world economy will experience the worst recession since the Great Depression.” Some economists are fearful it could last a decade or more.

And it has been argued that a full-scale outbreak in Africa or South America, accompanied by economic shutdowns, could lead to a flood of refugees from these continents that might swamp neighbouring health systems.

Can we institute effective public health measures that allow for economic growth? At the very least, shouldn’t there be a full-scale public discussion about this?

Bob Plecas, a retired deputy minister in the B.C. government, has offered a solution on these pages that, for what it’s worth, I think makes sense.

Plecas points out that if we want broader considerations given a hearing, then the proper venues to construct future policies are the federal and provincial cabinets. There you have ministers representing small businesses, the tourism industry, forestry, municipal government and so on, all sectors of the economy under extreme pressure.

You also have foreign-affairs staff who can speak to the implications in poorer countries.

Certainly the advice of public-health staff will play a central part in that analysis. But a wider range of voices must be heard if we are to avoid the kinds of disasters predicted by the UN and others.

A common response is employers and management teams need to work toward identifying their own biases, before things can improve for Indigenous employees.

Bias doesn’t just affect Indigenous people — it affects us all. In some cases, we are oppressed and others the oppressors. It can be uncomfortable to look within ourselves to identify our own biases, but if we don’t, nothing will change.

article continues below

Biases comes up all the time. We all have them. We need to understand that some biases we carry knowingly, and others are drawn on subconsciously. Sometimes bias can be displayed loudly and other times its underlying.

“We all grow up here and we are bombarded by millions of messages, many of which are upheld by institutions and it’s impossible to not be influenced,” Janice Abbott, CEO of Atira Women’s Resource Society, explained, adding these messages can lead to racism, sexism, misogyny, ageism, ableism and heterosexism.

Like most flaws, it is easier to identify bias in others than in ourselves, but it’s important for everyone to take a moment and think about it even if it is uncomfortable.

“Too many of us are way too committed to the idea that we are awesome and unwilling to reflect on our own biases,” said Abbott. “And while we may not choose to admit we have biases, we mostly know they exist. Basically, we have to want to change and then understand it’s a life-long journey with stumbles, and so it requires our absolute commitment.”

I recently took an Indigenous cultural safety course that had a few exercises on stereotypes and bias that I found challenging. One of these exercises was a list of stereotypes I was asked to sort into categories of different demographics. I had a hard time and felt awful because I knew what stereotypes they wanted me to link with individual groups, but I couldn’t actually force my mouse to connect them together. Right under the exercise was a statement saying it was meant to be uncomfortable.

We can be biased of people for many reasons that have nothing to do with race. Bias can include making assumptions about age, education, income, family composition, gender and sexual orientation. Bias is a shortcut our brain takes to process the millions of messages we are exposed to that Abbott mentioned. Not all shortcuts are good, and I think it could make a world of difference if we take a second to pause and assess some of these shortcuts.

Our bias makes snap judgments on how people look and behave, often resulting in unfortunate outcomes.

A recent example is the woman in New York’s Central Park calling 911 on a man who was bird-watching and who asked her to follow the park’s guidelines and put her dog on leash. When the conversation turned to a verbal dispute, the man started filming and the woman called 911 stating: “There is an African American man threatening my life.”

The story is disheartening, because in the video it appears the woman is stating the man is African American because she is hoping to garner a specific type of reaction, which could be deadly for the man. The video has spread worldwide.

While this is an example from the United States, we need to remember things like this happen here, too. During my conversation with Abbott, she raised a very important point, one that I am not sure we as Canadians think about.

“Being Canadian, we are often told that we are less racist, kinder, more accepting than other people,” Abbott said, explaining this as a bias we are taught to be true. “So we think we’re good and we’re shocked when it turns out the Amy Coopers are Canadian. Who wants to be less bad at something that is evil anyway? Is that our bar?”

Abbott noted that bias begins in our homes, and as we get older, we are exposed to bias through our peer groups and institutions. If we acknowledge our own biases and address them, we can reduce the biases that we pass on to others.

Interestingly, most academic articles about mindfulness relate mindlessness to an absence of emotional intelligence.","Not to rush to a generalized conclusion, but the COVID-19 pandemic has drawn a clear line between both the concepts and practices of “mindfulness” and “mindlessness.”

That’s not just about existing divisions in our society, but is more about those upon whom we rely upon for leadership and guidance in a time of crisis and upon whom the political, social and economic stability of our country’s future rests.

article continues below

That guidance and leadership influences the rest of us and our behaviour for better of worse.

“Mindfulness” gets a bad rap as some kind of hippy-dippy wannabe Zen Buddhism practice, but in fact mindfulness simply refers to a state of active, open attention to the present, the ability to live and accept the real world.

As we observe the words and actions of a variety of leaders during a crisis such as the COVID pandemic, the distinction becomes clearer.

To live mindfully is to live in the moment and to reawaken oneself and others to the present, as opposed to dwelling on the past.

Philosophers like Soren Kierkegaard describe this state as “existentialism,” meaning, in unpretentious terms, what happens when an individual is continually faced with diverse possibilities from among which the existent (i.e., the human individual) must make a selection to which he/she must then commit.

Big word, simple meaning.

Dr. Bonnie Henry is an example of a softly spoken person who simply relates the facts of the situation. She is a model of mindfulness. As Marshall McLuhan might have put it, she is both the medium and the message.

Mindfulness is the ability to link cause and effect or even action and consequence socially, economically, personally and politically.

Mindlessness, on the other hand, is not intended as a pejorative term but simply describes a state of being unmindful or heedless.

Mindlessness is toxic for a democracy.

As Costica Bradatan, Professor of Humanities at Texas Tech University wrote recently in the New York Times: “Democracy is for the Gods and it should be no surprise that humans cannot sustain a democracy,” adding that “world history, for the most part, is the story of excessively mindless self-assertive individuals in search of various sceptres.”

Bradatan points out that even in a steadily failing once-upon-a-time democracy such as the United States of America, it doesn’t help matters that a self-serving individual, despite all flags or warning, has been enthroned as leader. Others seem only too eager to mindlessly submit to his mindlessness.

After all, mindlessness is easier than thinking.

Interestingly, most academic articles about mindfulness relate mindlessness to an absence of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence, unlike linguistic intelligence, logical or mathematical intelligence, musical intelligence, kinesthetic body intelligence or spatial-visual intelligence explains why the people we tend to admire and identify with most comfortably in life display other-centredness and kindness rather than cruelty in their interactions with others.

Mindlessness often dissipates with maturity, and sometimes, to the dismay and frustration of the mindful, is unintentionally common among young (and sometimes older) emerging minds. “Good judgment,” as the saying goes, “comes from experience and too often experience comes from bad judgment.”

All well and good, but what does any of this have to do with individual and cultural reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic?

Some people, it seems, are approaching the pandemic risks mindfully, while others, frustrated because they can’t gather in groups or do the familiar self gratifying things that provide them with immediate short-term pleasure, resist experienced fact-based advice mindlessly.

In this time of COVID-19, many of us can relate to the annoyance of having experienced a loss of control that has been replaced by a great sense of vulnerability for ourselves and others, along with a whirlwind of challenging emotions, including fear, guilt and grief.

In some ways, it feels like revisiting the uncertainties of adolescence, because with so many unknowns, we are left with no choice other than to live existentially in the present moment, one day at a time, which isn’t so easy for most adults.

Mindfulness then becomes an actual life-saving social imperative. The mindful are paying attention to present experiences with curiosity and compassion, and in doing so, learn to co-operate with experiences, rather than resisting or fighting them.

Simply being in denial about undeniable reality is mindlessness. Falling, as they say, feels like flying for a little while but then the illusion is brutally brought back to the inflexible uncompromising reality of landing “hard.”

As Bradatan concludes in his piece about the survival of a democracy through a crisis: “One element that is needed for democracy to emerge is a sense of humility,” and it seems reasonable to say that being mindful on behalf of our own safety and that of others during the COVID-19 crisis requires much more than a mere spoonful of humility.

What led to this trash talking, more of which in a moment, was the decision by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to begin a new life on Vancouver Island. Now I’m not sure that decision still holds — there’s been talk they might prefer Hollywood, a genuinely characterless backwater.

But apparently, the thought of losing what it calls “one of the world’s glamorous couples” was more than the paper could stomach.

Hence we get this: the “relatively young couple seem anxious to escape the restrictions of the UK monarchy … so picking … underpopulated Vancouver Island, with fir trees in every direction, freezing winters and a brief six-week summer might seem understandable … in reality, it’s just plain weird. Instead of Lake Como they’ve got a rocky beach with grey skies overhead ... Have we Brits really upset the Duke and Duchess of Sussex so much they prefer the hum drum [sic] existence of downtown Victoria, with its limited choice of fine dining and trendy cafés?”

And: “If Canada is so fabulous, how come so many famous Canadians live elsewhere?”

Then again: “What cuisine has Canada given the world — apart from maple syrup, bacon and a disgusting dish called poutine, which consists of cheese curds, chips and brown sauce.”

Plus “The average age [Canadians] start drinking is 13 and there’s a huge alcohol problem — maybe it’s the lack of things to do.”

Actually, the country with a “huge alcohol problem” is Britain, where the locals down 20 per cent more per capita than we do.

So let’s turn this around. First off, I’m fairly confident the ex-royal couple fled Britain to get away from outfits such as the Daily Mail, famous for scantily clad “models” and bare-faced rumour-mongering.

As well, if Britain is so fabulous, how come so many Brits live abroad? According to the 2016 census, a third of Canadians list their ethnic origin as English or Scottish.

And sliming weather on Vancouver Island when you’re writing for a newspaper based in England, home to one of the dreariest climates on the planet, takes nerve. The U.K. has been blasted with unprecedented gale-force winds, torrential rain and flooding in recent weeks.

But let’s get to the heart of the matter. I assume the author of this hit piece, Janet Street-Porter, lives in London, where the paper is published. Though in passing, she confesses to having spent two weeks once upon a time on Gabriola Island, where “pooing in a composting toilet has scarred me for life.”

In any event, traffic in London is now so hellish, you have to pay a $20 fee just to drive into town. There are indeed fine dining establishments and trendy cafés, but you would need a bank loan to eat at one.

And don’t think of buying a house — average price $1.4 million for an ancient pile built in the 1800s, with lousy wiring and a kitchen the size of a broom closet. Even a one-bedroom apartment can set you back $3,000 a month in rent.

Mangy foxes roam the streets and even mangier pigeons decorate your parked car with droppings. That is, if you can find somewhere to park it in the first place.

By general agreement, London’s underground — the Tube — is dirty, smelly and crowded, perhaps the worst of its kind in Europe.

And the city’s crime rate, at 96 offences per thousand residents, is 10 times the level on Vancouver Island, and rising rapidly.

In short, life in a “characterless backwater” such as North Saanich is heaven compared with eking out an existence in the concrete jungle Street-Porter calls home.

However, if she cares to pay us a visit, I’m sure we can find her a place with an indoor toilet, something you still can’t count on in that Sceptred Isle.

Enjoy.

To my dear AP English students,

article continues below

I wanted to contact you and tell you that I have been thinking about you and your families this past week. The first two days were kind of a novelty-like snow days without snow. The weather was beautiful, the daffodils and cherry trees were blooming, and things were coming back to life after a long, dreary winter.

When we got the call Wednesday and then Thursday about school closing, the novelty gave way to anxiety and worry. How long will this last? Will my students be OK? Will my elderly parents weather this virus? Everything seems even more amplified now. If you switch on the television, you might think the world is ending.

But, it isn’t.

One of the interesting things about getting older is that I have seen a lot of different things come and go. I haven’t seen as much as my grandfather — who was born into the Greatest Generation and saw so much tragedy on a global scale in his lifetime. However, I am a history nerd and I know that what we are experiencing is not completely unprecedented, historically.

What is unprecedented is the 24/7 news and social-media coverage of what they are now calling a “pandemic.”

Words really do matter, and I guess that the word “pandemic” is accurate — though I find it fear inducing and not necessarily helpful in quelling anxiety or helping people remain calm. It is an interesting word and when I first heard it, I thought of Pan — the Greek god of shepherds and flocks, woods and fields. “Pan” also means bread in Spanish. My mind wandered to the thought, if only “pandemic” meant “bread for all.”

Of course, “pandemic” is more sinister that either of those — an epidemic disease that has spread to “all,” the Latin root of the word. What is happening is terrible on a global scale.

So why I am writing to you this discourse about the word “pandemic”? Well, as you know, because I have been your teacher since August, I am a word geek who thinks very philosophically about things and can go down rabbit holes with that kind of thinking on a regular basis.

But, it is mainly because I miss teaching you and seeing you and talking to you about everything that is going on in the world right now, seeing your faces to see if you are OK and gauging your emotions to see how you are processing all of this.

When I was looking at social media yesterday, I saw a post by a young man that I thought I would share with you. He said: “I imagine all the closures and cancellations give people a sense of ominousness. But it’s really an amazing act of social solidarity: We’re sacrificing so we can give nurses, doctor and hospitals a fighting chance. Start from there and hopefully, we can figure out the rest.”

I thought that was a wonderful way to think positively about our current situation.

One of the best things about “all” of us in this together, is that we are “all” in it together! We can look out for one another and take care of one another until the virus (I feel like if I say the actual name, it is like summoning Voldemort or something …) settles down and runs its course.

Because it will run its course.

Because this will be over at some point.

So … in the meantime, we have extra time! Extra time to spend with family. Extra time to sleep. Extra time to read. Extra time to play games. Extra time to enjoy the beautiful spring weather that I am sure is just around the corner. Extra time to help others in need. Although isolation is not always fun, extra time is a tremendous gift!

So, even though for now, school and sports and public events have been cancelled, there are lots of things that are not cancelled!

Music is not cancelled!

Dancing is not cancelled!

Movies (at home) are not cancelled!

Conversations and discussions are not cancelled!

Reading is not cancelled!

Friendships are not cancelled!

Love is not cancelled!

Hope is not cancelled!

What we must cancel are fear, mass hysteria, too much screen time reading about the Virus that Should Not be Named, and the hoarding of toilet paper just to mention a few.

I hope you know that I am thinking of all of you during this time. I miss all of you and hope that you and your families are healthy and well.

I can’t wait to see you soon and get back to teaching you that “intricately patterned” masterpiece, my favourite novel in the entire world, The Great Gatsby. It truly is a wonder of a novel.

And, each of you is a “wonder,” and you are precious to me and so many others.

So, be safe, be reasonable and be kind.

And, lastly, WASH YOUR HANDS!"

This too shall pass. After winter, spring.

At least spring has been steadily creeping up on us. Birds have been gathering dried grass and twigs for nests. First leaves have lit up the Indian plum shrubs. The sun shines hot, even if the wind blows cold, with summer in the light and winter in the shade.

The days are lengthening. Blossom by blossom the spring has been unfolding, with snowdrops, crocuses, daffodils, and blooming quince and cherry trees.

Many of these signs are daylight and temperature dependent. They arrive with some consistency every year, with leeway of a week or three or four, as inevitable as the planet circles the sun. Yes, hold on — life will get warmer.

Other local signs of spring are less sure this year. The bass-note cruise-ship hoots and toots will be missing from Victoria’s springtime soundscape. Due to concerns about COVID-19, Transport Canada has banned boats and cruise ships carrying more than 500 people from docking at Canadian ports until July.

The 290 ship-visit season had been set to begin in Victoria April 3, with the arrival of the Grand Princess.

Almost 115 cruise-ship arrivals will not take place this spring — and almost 300,000 passengers they would have brought to the city won’t be visiting.

That’s not what Victoria city council had in mind last year when it passed a motion to limit the number of cruise ships allowed to dock in the city each year until the industry takes significant steps to be greener. It’s not what council had in mind in January when it passed a motion to possibly increase cruise ship waste-dumping fees in the region.

Yet the result will be the same. In James Bay this year, signs of spring will not include diesel exhaust from ships in port running their generators to power their facilities, the sound of those engines rumbling day and night, nor the usual cruise-related traffic.

And while the days grow longer and warmer and the cherry blossoms peak, then wane, local businesses and people who rely on tourism will feel a deep, lingering winter chill this year. The cancelled cruise visits alone could mean at least $50 million less economic activity in the region.

Government directives to postpone non-essential international travel, bans on non-Canadians entering the country from overseas, restrictions on where international flights can land, cancellation of large events and public gatherings, increased social distancing and self-isolation — these and other changes to how we go about our lives will delay the gearing up of activity and industry we normally see at this time of year.

An economic Lent is advancing, and a financial winter, with its hardscrabble, hunker-down discontent, is extending its reach into April, May and June.

No Times Colonist 10K run, provincials hockey, Capital City Comic Con, or performances will occur until further notice. The University of Victoria has cancelled many classes, with some courses switching to delivery methods that don’t involve in-person gatherings. Brick-and-mortar schools are closed indefinitely. Bars and pubs are shuttered, and restaurants are advised to apply the government’s social distancing directives.

It’s a crisis. But this too will pass. A month ago, health officials were hoping to eliminate the COVID-19 virus, much as happened after the 2003 SARS epidemic. Now, they’re seeking to slow its spread and delay its peak until after flu and cold season — all to relieve pressure on the health-care system, give health authorities time to prepare and give scientists time to develop a workable vaccine or find anti-viral medications that slow the virus’s advance.

They’ve accepted that the virus will eventually establish itself throughout populations around the world, much as influenza and cold viruses have.

We will adapt, one way or another.

No winter and no pandemic lasts forever. Spring — however we define it and by whatever signs we characterize — will come. What it will look like is another question.

It’s tough to do so because right now everything seems to funnel back to the worldwide pandemic.

There is a lot of uncertainty in our world right now and as we watch public spaces, businesses, and institutions close their doors to the public for the near future, it only reinforces what we are going through is real.

article continues below

When I was born, my Grandma Bessie was around 70 years old. She was always an old grandma who was very short with brown eyes and curly white hair.

When I was too sick to go to school, I would go to my grandma’s house and watch The Price is Right and make boats out of egg cartons and make them float in her bathtub.

My grandmother was very frugal and made sure not to be wasteful. Every time I would visit her at her apartment, my Grandma Bessie would give me a small handful of pennies. For my birthdays and on Christmas I would get a bag with a small collection of pennies inside.

As I got older, I realized that every time my Grandma Bessie received a penny in her change, she would put it away for me. She had many grandchildren, and today, it makes me feel special that whenever she had a penny, she thought of me.

I did not have this realization until later in life. I remember being a very unimpressed 15-year-old one Christmas, unwrapping a bread bag with pennies and breadcrumbs in the bottom when my older brother was gifted movie passes.

My grandma lived during the Great Depression and it was an experience that really moulded the woman she became. When she was a young teenager, I think about 14 or 15, her parents told her they couldn’t afford to keep her in the home anymore and she would have to leave home and start taking care of herself financially.

Being sent out into the world on her own, she found work taking care of people with disabilities and making bombshells for the war. Making bombshells was something that haunted her for her entire life. She never escaped the guilt that she felt, even though her friends and family tried to comfort her and reminded her of her circumstances at the time.

Bessie searched for peace through religion and doing her best to be the kindest person she could. She lived to be 94 years old.

This experience shaped her frugal ways, her refusal to waste anything and her determination to ensure food never found its way into the bin. Valuing each and every penny she collected must fall into their, somewhere, too.

I was told about my grandmother’s experiences during the Great Depression many times over in my life. I always knew this happened to her, but I could never really comprehend how the world could turn upside down so fast.

Over these past few weeks, we’ve all seen it happen and our perceptions and thoughts have changed dramatically as we see how quickly things are happening now. We are living in a time of uncertainty. People are losing their jobs and self-employed people are losing contracts. There is no doubt that this is a hurdle for all of us.

There are many vulnerabilities right now that include our health, our finances and our families.

As a community we are working together toward social-distancing and flattening the curve. Scientists are working toward a vaccine.

I don’t know what the future holds. I hope that we can try to step outside of our own experiences and make sure that our friends, families and neighbours are being taken care of mentally, emotionally and financially.

There are bound to be many lessons we learn and experiences that shape who we become as we age. This is a reminder to us all that life can turn upside down at any moment. We need to find ways to be more understanding and compassionate, because there will always be someone having a harder time than us.

The young folks reading this are probably asking themselves: “What are pennies?”

If we did nothing, hundreds of thousands of Canadians, especially older people, might die and the health care system would be overwhelmed, jeopardizing the health of many other people with other health problems. Flattening the curve will reduce the peak of the epidemic, spreading it out over a longer period of time. This also buys us time to find treatment or a vaccine.

So around the world today and across Canada borders are closed, as are schools, universities, libraries, rec centres, cafés, pubs and many businesses, large and small. Our communities and societies have been brought to a halt, or at least to a dramatic slowdown, and our economies are in a tailspin.

article continues below

But many might be concerned that the public-health and societal effort to contain COVID-19 comes at a huge cost to society, that it is triggering a global recession, that it might even lead to a depression. Could it even be the case that the social and economic disruption we create will kill or sicken more people than does the disease?

After all, the Great Depression in North America and Europe was a time of great misery and despair. Surely that was bad for health. Surprisingly, it seems that was not the case; in fact, the opposite was true.

A 2009 paper co-authored by a leading American social epidemiologist, Ana Diez Roux at the University of Michigan, examined life and death during the Great Depression.

They found “population health did not decline and indeed improved during the Great Depression of 1930-1933” and that death rates “decreased for almost all ages, and gains of several years in life expectancy were observed for males, females, whites and non-whites — with the latter group being the group that most benefited.”

This is not to say there are no ill-effects of a recession or depression. They note that among the six main causes of death, accounting for about two-thirds of all deaths in the 1930s, “only suicides increased during the Great Depression.” Today, at a time of industrial decay in some parts of the U.S., we have seen an increase in deaths from the “diseases of despair” — alcohol and drug use (especially opioids) and suicide — among lower-middle income middle-age men.

But contrary to our expectations, they note, “years of strong economic growth are associated with either worsening health or with a slowing of secular improvements in health.” Moreover, they added, this “was first noted decades ago, but was largely ignored until recently.”

The reasons for increased deaths during economic expansions, they report, include “increases in smoking and alcohol consumption, reductions in sleep and increases in work stress” as well as increases in “traffic or industrial injuries … [and] atmospheric pollution.”

As I have noted before, there are many businesses and many ways of making a profit that can harm health. Just recently, I reported that a joint WHO-UNICEF-Lancet Commission had identified commercial activities as one of the three greatest threats to children’s health, along with climate change and poverty; all are influenced by this COVID-19 recession.

Environmental scientists have already noted a dramatic reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions in China and Italy, and this will soon become worldwide. Indeed, Stanford University environmental resource economist Marshall Burke suggested in early March that the reduction in air pollution in China might have already saved more lives than the COVID-19 epidemic had cost.

We can already see the reductions in traffic on our local roads, which will not only reduce air pollution and carbon emissions but crashes and injuries.

If this goes on for months, as it might, we will likely see increasing need for government support for laid-off workers, strengthening support for some form of guaranteed income and/or shelter — basic requirements for health — is met. Coupled with that we can expect reduced demand for more “stuff,” as people adjust to lower incomes.

It might be that with this combination of reduced consumption and reduced environmental harm, coupled with societal commitment to ensuring the meeting of basic needs for all, we will find ourselves unintentionally creating the well-being economy we need in the 21st century.

How does the virus spread?
“Right now, we need to keep our hands to ourselves, keep our germs to ourselves,” Henry said.
Cruise passengers include travellers from around the world who might be arriving from areas with known or unknown spread of COVID-19.
The reason for stocking up on these items is not necessarily because you will need to self-isolate.","What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people and others cause illness in animals. Human coronaviruses are common. They are typically associated with mild illnesses, similar to the common cold.

article continues below

COVID-19 is a new disease that has not been previously identified in humans. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people, and more rarely, these can then spread from person to person through close contact.

There have been two other specific coronaviruses that have spread from animals to humans and which have caused severe illness in humans: SARS and MERS.

How worried should I be?

The illness caused by COVID-19 is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: an estimated one in five people who catch it needs hospital care, and in severe cases, infection can lead to death.

Older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.

According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe ailments might take three to six weeks to rebound. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed, but more than 60,000 already have recovered.

There are also ways to reduce your risk of catching it.

How likely am I to catch it?

The risk depends on where you are and whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in most places, the risk of becoming infected remains low. On Vancouver Island, for example, there have been eight cases, as of Monday.

Complying with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings helps to reduce the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

In B.C., the government is asking people who have been travelling overseas to self-isolate for 14 days and watch for symptoms. Gatherings and events of more than 250 people have been cancelled.

What symptoms should I look out for?

Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Some people have developed pneumonia in both lungs.

That said, those who are infected with COVID-19 might have little to no symptoms, and many symptoms are similar to those of a cold or flu, so you might not realize you have COVID-19.

It appears that it could take up to 14 days for symptoms to appear after a person is exposed to the virus.

What should I do if I feel sick?

If you are sick, the first thing you need to do is stay home, away from others, says provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry.

People experiencing symptoms such as a fever, dry cough or difficulty breathing are asked to contact their primary-care providers or call HealthLink B.C. at 811 to be assessed. People who require follow-up will be directed to call a testing clinic, where a triage nurse will reassess them to determine if an appointment for testing is needed.

Do I need to get tested?

Only if you are told to get one by your primary care provider or HealthLink B.C. Those who are symptom-free don’t have to be tested for COVID-19, even if they have been travelling abroad.

Isn’t the flu worse than COVID-19?

In terms of sheer numbers, influenza has a greater impact than the new coronavirus.

According to the World Health Organization, annual flu epidemics are estimated to result in about three million to five million cases of severe illness. Seasonal flu kills far fewer than one per cent of those infected.

For comparison, there were 142,539 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5,393 deaths as of Saturday. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is estimated to be between one and four per cent.

Both the flu and COVID-19 cause respiratory disease and spread the same way, via small droplets of fluid from the nose and mouth of someone who is sick. Influenza appears to transmit more efficiently, with people who are not yet sick being major spreaders of the disease.

However, COVID-19 appears to cause more severe disease than seasonal influenza. Because it is new, no one has immunity. That means more people are susceptible to infection. And unlike the flu, there are no vaccines or specific treatments for COVID-19. (However, clinical trials are underway and several vaccines are in development.)

How does the virus spread?

Coronavirus is transmitted via larger liquid droplets when a person coughs or sneezes. For that reason, the virus is not thought to be airborne — transmitted through particles floating in the air. However, you can become infected if you are in close contact and these droplets enter through the eyes, nose or throat.

It can be spread by touch if a person has used their hands to cover their mouth or nose when they cough. That’s why you should cough or sneeze into your arm, avoid shaking or touching hands, and wash your hands regularly.

You can also catch it by touching an object with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands. Again, wash your hands regularly.

Because it’s a heavier droplet, it only spreads about one metre through coughing or sneezing. It’s not clear how long the virus lasts on surfaces.

It is most likely to be transmitted by infected individuals to people they live with, spend time with in close indoor settings, or by sharing food.

Can you become sick from someone before they show symptoms?

Health officials still are investigating whether the virus can be transmitted to others if someone is not showing symptoms. Experts believe it is possible, but rare.

How can I keep from getting sick?

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry advises “doing all those things that we need to do at this time of the year to prevent transmissions of infections,” including cleaning hands regularly, covering your mouth with your sleeve, not touching your face and eyes, staying away from others and staying home if you’re sick.

Wash your hands, regularly and thoroughly, using soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand rub. Wash them for at least 20 seconds, and be sure to include your wrist, fingertips and between your fingers.

Practise social distancing, keeping at least one metre (three feet) away from others, especially anyone who is coughing or sneezing.

Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth. Your hands touch a lot of surfaces and can pick up viruses, which can then be transferred to your eyes, nose or mouth — where they can enter your body and make you sick.

Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a disposable tissue. Throw out the tissue immediately.

Stay away from COVID-19 hotspots — areas where the virus is spreading widely. There is a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in these areas.

Regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, and do not share food, drinks or utensils.

Should I wear a mask?

If you are sick, wearing a mask helps prevent you from passing on illnesses to other people.

If you are not sick, it might be less effective to wear a mask in the community.

What is social distancing?

It’s not forever, but provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry is asking people to distance themselves from others, at least a metre — about the distance that the novel coronavirus droplets spread through coughing or sneezing can travel.

If you are at a gathering of a few people, consider sitting in every second seat. Avoid hugging, kissing and shaking hands.

“Right now, we need to keep our hands to ourselves, keep our germs to ourselves,” Henry said. “Make it OK within our family groups and within our religious and social groups that we [greet one another] from a distance right now. We look people in the eyes. We smile in the same way that we have before.”

What is self-monitoring?

Self-monitoring means watching your health and the health of your children for symptoms such as fever, cough and difficulty breathing.

Anyone who self-monitors is asked to avoid crowded public spaces and places where you cannot easily separate yourself from others if you become ill. Individuals who are self-monitoring are allowed to attend and work in school and participate in regular activities.

I’ve been travelling — what should I do?

B.C. has asked anyone who has been out of the country to self-isolate.

Self-isolation means avoiding situations where you could infect other people to help prevent the spread of infections.

Stay at home and limit contact with others for 14 days. That means not going to work or school.

Monitor yourself daily for symptoms such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing for these 14 days. If you develop symptoms, call HealthLink B.C. (811) or speak with your health-care provider to discuss any need for testing and follow-up.

People who have self-isolated can return to normal activities after 14 days if they have not developed any symptoms.

If you’re concerned that you might have been exposed to the virus because you recently travelled to one of the affected areas — such as Washington state, Italy, China, or Iran — call your health-care provider, if you have one, or 811 to speak to a nurse who will help guide you through the process.

Can I still travel?

The federal governments have issued a global travel advisory, telling Canadians to avoid non-essential travel abroad.

Travel could be severely interrupted because many governments are imposing entry, exit and movement restrictions, the Foreign Affairs Department said. Canadians outside the country should consider an early return, it said.

To limit the spread of COVID-19, many countries have put in place travel or border restrictions and other measures such as movement restrictions and quarantines. Airlines have cancelled flights. New restrictions could be imposed with little warning. Your travel plans might be severely disrupted and you might be forced to remain outside of Canada longer than expected.

Contact your airline or tour operator to determine options for cancelling or postponing your trip.

The Government of Canada is advising that you avoid all travel on cruise ships due to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, until further notice.

Cruise passengers include travellers from around the world who might be arriving from areas with known or unknown spread of COVID-19.

The virus can spread quickly on board cruises due to the close contact between passengers. Older people and people with a weakened immune system or underlying medical condition are at a higher risk of developing severe disease.

Should I be stocking up on food?

The Canadian Public Health Agency recommends stocking up on non-perishable food items, so that you do not need to go shopping if you become sick or if there is a larger outbreak.

It is easier on the supply chain if people gradually build up their household stores instead of making large-scale purchases all at once. To do this, you can add a few extra items to your grocery cart every time you shop.

Some good options include easy-to-prepare foods such as dried pasta and sauce, canned soups and canned vegetables and beans. It’s also good to have extra pet food, toilet paper, facial tissue, feminine hygiene products and diapers, as applicable, on hand.

The reason for stocking up on these items is not necessarily because you will need to self-isolate. Having these supplies on hand will ensure you do not need to leave your home at the peak of the outbreak or if you become ill.

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

article continues below

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister.
""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.
""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

The gravitas of the moment was not lost on the former journalist and mother of three. After she spoke the English words of her oath of office, she paused to take a deep breath, before repeating the oath in French.

article continues below

""It's about time,"" Freeland said later at a press conference on Parliament Hill.

She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.

Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.

But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.

""There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,"" said Turnbull. ""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.""

Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.

She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.

""We don't like their representative very much,"" he said of her in September 2018.

Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said ""Mama (does not equal) chopped liver."" On the back it said ""Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.""

When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.

And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.

""She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,"" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.

He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.

""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.

""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.

""I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,"" he said. ""And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.""

She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.

""What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,"" Kelly said on Twitter. ""This has been missing in the department for several years.""

MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.

While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.

Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.

Trudeau said Tuesday that she had been ""a key player in my government from day one.""

The Nisga'a Lisims government said Tuesday that Gosnell died in his home in New Aiyansh after a long battle with cancer.

article continues below

Gosnell was a hereditary Nisga'a chieftain of the Eagle Clan and was president of the nation when it finalized a landmark treaty in 2000 that gave the First Nation control over its land including forestry and fishing rights. It was the first modern-day treaty signed in B.C. since the 1800s.

Nisga'a Nation president Eva Clayton said Gosnell's wisdom, dignity and determination helped lead the First Nation into self-government over its territory northeast of Prince Rupert.

""Today, we have lost a giant,"" Clayton said in a statement. ""His legacy will help shape the project of reconciliation for generations to come.""

Gosnell was a recipient of the Order of Canada, the Order of B.C. and held an honorary doctorate of laws from Royal Roads University in Victoria.

He is survived by his wife of 64 years, Audrey, their seven children and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Gosnell grew up in the Nass River Valley in B.C.'s northwest. He worked as a commercial fisherman, carpenter and traditional carver before he was elected as a band councillor and chief of the Gitlaxt'aamiks Band, one of the Nisga'a village governments.

Gosnell was appointed chancellor of the University of Northern B.C. last year and served until his death.

University interim president Geoffrey Payne said Gosnell's dedication to education was evident during his time as chancellor.

""The world has lost a tremendous leader, a man who repeatedly demonstrated a love for his community, his people, education and a commitment to enhancing the lives of others,"" Payne said in a statement.

Clayton said Gosnell's work to negotiate the Nisga'a Treaty produced a ""beacon of hope"" for people around the world.

""His focus was always on what the Nisga'a, British Columbians and Canadians can achieve together,"" she said.

When a bill to accept the treaty was introduced in the legislature in December 1998, Gosnell told the house the agreement proved to the world that reasonable people can sit down and settle historical wrongs.

""It's a triumph because under the treaty, we will no longer be wards of the state, no longer beggars in our own land. It's a triumph because under the treaty, we will collectively own approximately 2,000 square kilometres of land, far exceeding the postage-stamp reserve set aside for us by colonial governments.""

He said the treaty proved that negotiations — not lawsuits, blockades or violence — are the most effective and honourable way to resolve Aboriginal issues.

""It's a triumph, I believe, that signals the end of the Indian Act, the end of more than a century of humiliation, degradation and despair for the Nisga'a Nation.""

Premier John Horgan said in a tweet that everyone can learn from Gosnell's legacy of working to make life better for people and he'll be missed.

""He was instrumental in helping the Nisga'a chart a new path of self-governance through BC's first modern treaty.""

The nation said funeral arrangements will be announced by the family.

The BC Wildfire Service said crews are responding to the fire on Christie Mountain about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, on the east side of Skaha Lake.

The fire is estimated at 250 hectares and firefighters on the ground are being supported by air tankers.

The service said the situation was ""rapidly evolving"" and asked everyone to stay clear of the area to avoid interfering with the operation.

The order asks residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with pets and critical items.

""We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,"" the service said in a tweet.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a ""fire of note"" on Tuesday.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was smouldering with no open flame but was considered out of control. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight.

Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Firefighters have tackled dozens of wildfires after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions.

Two fires were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada has estimated returning sockeye would hit a record low this year, with about 283,000 fish or fewer making it from the ocean to their Fraser River spawning grounds.

Just last month, the department estimated 941,000 sockeye would return, though it noted salmon forecasts were highly uncertain, in part because of a lack of understanding of the effects of warming ocean waters.

The council, made up of the B.C. Assembly of First Nations, the First Nations Summit and Union of B.C. Indian chiefs, says Indigenous communities that rely on the salmon for food face the greatest impacts, but the department has consistently prioritized commercial fishing.

Representatives with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans were not immediately available for comment.

First Nations fishing rights are protected by the Constitution and the council says the federal government has failed in its duty to ensure they have priority access to salmon.

Robert Phillips with the First Nations Summit says Indigenous leaders have been calling on Ottawa to save the salmon for decades and it's time for full jurisdiction over salmon stocks to be transferred back to First Nations.

Five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations on Vancouver Island have also accused federal fisheries officials of systemic racism after the government decided to exclude them in the allocation of 15,000 extra salmon this year — a surplus that arose because fewer people were fishing recreationally during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Salmon returning to the Fraser River also face the added hurdle of making it over a massive landslide along a remote stretch of the river north of Lillooet.

A pneumatic pump and tube system and the construction of a fish ladder have been installed to help salmon over the five-metre waterfall created by the slide.

In an update last week, Fisheries and Oceans said water levels have dropped sufficiently in recent days to allow fish to pass over the slide on their own steam.

A Department of Fisheries document from 2017 says total adult returns of Fraser River sockeye are highly variable ranging from 2 to 28 million, with an average of 9.6 million, between 1980 and 2014.

The first state of emergency was declared on March 18, the day after provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry declared a public health emergency.

This latest extension will end on Sept. 1 and allows the government to manage immediate concerns, such as recent outbreaks in some areas of the province.

Premier John Horgan says B.C. residents have made sacrifices to keep transmission rates down, but now unsafe gatherings are eroding that progress.

The province announced 83 new cases on Tuesday for a total of 4,677 cases since the pandemic began.

No new deaths were reported, leaving the total number of fatalities at 198.

There are 775 active cases in B.C. and 2,326 people under monitoring because they have been exposed to someone who has been infected with COVID-19.

In a statement, Horgan says the government is committed to getting back on track and it will announce new enforcement measures against those who put others at risk.

""The vast majority of British Columbians are following Dr. Henry's orders of seeing fewer faces in bigger spaces, but we all have to remain committed to flattening the curve,"" he said.

In documents filed by her court-appointed lawyer that give a rare public airing to the wishes of the 38-year-old pop superstar, she asked that her father not return to the role of conservator of her person, which gave him power over her major life decisions from 2008 until 2019, when he temporarily stepped aside, citing health problems.

article continues below

""Britney is strongly opposed to James return as conservator of her person,"" the document says.

James Spears has kept his separate role as conservator over his daughter's finances. For the first 11 years of the conservatorship, he served as co-conservator with attorney Andrew M. Wallet, who resigned from the role early last year.

That briefly left James Spears with sole power over Britney Spears' life, money and career, a situation she says she very much wants to avoid repeating.

An email seeking comment from James Spears' attorney was not immediately returned.

Spears says she wants Jodi Montgomery, who has been serving as conservator of her person temporarily, to do so permanently, but she says that doesn't mean she is waiving her right to seek an end to the entire arrangement.

The documents also reveal that Britney Spears has no plans to perform again anytime soon. She last performed live in October 2018, and early in 2019, cancelled a planned Las Vegas residency.

The filing gave a rare glimpse at Britney Spears' own wishes in the conservatorship that has had vast power over her for over a decade. She has almost never spoken publicly about the matter, and court hearings and documents in the case are cloaked in secrecy, though last year she addressed the court at her request, suggesting she was seeking changes.

In the papers, Britney Spears praises the conservatorship and its work overall, saying it ""rescued her from a collapse, exploitation by predatory individuals and financial ruin"" and that it made her ""able to regain her position as a world class entertainer.""

The document was filed a day before a status hearing on the conservatorship, expected to be closed to the media and public.

Britney Spears' attorney said that he expects James Spears will aggressively contest being marginalized, and said that Britney Spears has suggested they retain a lawyer with expertise in complex financial court fights.

The conservatorship, known in some states as a guardianship, gave James Spears power over his daughter's career choices and much of her personal life, including her relationship with her teenage sons. Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline has custody of the boys, but she has frequent visits with them.

When you are The Killers and your usual guitarist has gone, no problem. When you’re The Killers you can turn to Lindsey Buckingham.

article continues below

The former Fleetwood Mac guitarist steps in for a tune on the new 10-song ""Imploding the Mirage,"" another sign of the band’s clout. The album's guests also include k.d. lang and Adam Granduciel of The War on Drugs.

The absence of guitarist and co-founder Dave Keuning is felt, with keyboards and drums stepping into the void. Without Keuning’s jangle and riff shards, The Killers have a more poppy sound.

If 2017's ""Wonderful Wonderful"" was a meditation on the anxiety of masculinity, the new album often explores the lives of women, with two sharp portraits of tough survivors in ""Blowback"" and ""Caution"" — women whom Brandon Flowers sings each come from ""white trash.""

Many other songs are about loyally backing a partner. ""I’ll be there when water’s rising/I’ll be your lifeguard,"" Flowers sings on ""Dying Breed."" On ""When the Dreams Run Dry,"" he vows: ""I’ll be on your side/When the dreams run dry."" In ""Lightening Fields,"" he sings, ""Just wanted to run my fastest/And stand beside you."" The cover of the album depicts a god tenderly supporting a goddess.

Jonathan Rado of California psychedelic-rock duo Foxygen and Shawn Everett — who worked on ""Wonderful Wonderful"" as well as with Kacey Musgraves and Alabama Shakes — have stepped in to produce and their influence can best be heard on the funky ""Fire in Bone.""

Elsewhere, listeners may have fun finding the band's other influences. There's a Tom Petty-ish sound to ""Blowback"" and ""My Own Soul's Warning"" has a Springsteen vibe. But there's no mistaking that classic Killers mix of soaring vocals, sonic bombast and sly humour in such songs as ""My God"" and the title track. It's a solid album from a band still exploring.

""This is me. I am 'Pipe Nation,'"" she said with a laugh Monday during an interview with The Canadian Press in Sundre, Alta., a picturesque oil town nestled near the Rocky Mountains.

article continues below

""I've been working in the oil and gas industry for about six years. I took a break when the bust happened and did a little serving, a little bartending but always went back to the oil and gas,"" added Gamble, who is 24.

""My father, my grandfather and my great grandfather were all in the oil and gas industry as well.""

Sundre is set to become the fictional community of Hardwell. The drama will focus on day-to-day hardships labourers face, with Gamble's character as the leader of a pipe gang — workers who position and align the pipe, preparing it for the weld. In real life, Gamble has held a number of jobs in the industry including welding.

But this is her first acting part since middle school.

""I always wanted to become an actor because I always thought pretending to be someone and falling into a character is a lot of fun and being someone else,"" she said.

""Unfortunately that's not the direction I went to until now when I got handed this beautiful opportunity that my little-girl dream could come true.""

Filmmaker and director Raoul Bhatt says he wanted a mix of both professional and amateur actors on set, and he's not concerned about the lack of experience from some of his cast members. He sees it as an asset to the project.

""I needed this to be believable and I needed someone with a certain language, a certain grit, combined with people who have actor experience,"" said Bhatt, adding 480 people showed up for the casting call. ""I wanted someone who's believable, honest, sincere and lives in the moment.""

Bhatt, who grew up in Edmonton, has a soft spot for the energy sector and says the show is meant to spotlight the colourful nature of the individuals.

""They're just beautiful people and to showcase that beyond the Dow Jones, beyond just the oil and gas numbers to human struggle, conditions and overcoming adversity and the determination of these characters is what the show is about,"" he said.

Bhatt, a software engineer who self-funded the pilot, has worked as a cinematographer and producer for the Daytime Emmys, as well as with Universal Studios' ""Jurassic World"" and a number of music videos.

He understands there are plenty of people out there who are not fans of the oil and gas industry.

""We are leaning toward pro but again that's for the viewer to decide. If you're against the oil and gas industry that's your opinion but I really hope this creates an emotional connection with the characters.""

Filming of the pilot will be completed by the end of August. Bhatt said he is in negotiations with a couple of streaming services for a 10-episode season.

A storage lot for oilfield equipment in Sundre is one of the regular sets. In addition, a portion of farmland in Sundre has been cleared for the actual building of a mini pipeline to add to the realism of the show.

Bhatt isn't short on technical advisers. Gin Ford, who plays the character Dee, has been a pipeline welder for the past 10-plus years. She has no acting experience but intends to use the show as a vessel for female empowerment and women in the energy industry.

""I'm not here for fame or recognition. I am actually here to make a voice for women in trades. Here's the moment for me to be a voice,"" said Ford.

""I've been called the pipeline princess and it's like, you can roll onto site and right way it's 'this girl's out here to work?'"" she said.

""I definitely want to highlight you can look like you want and you can still work in a male-dominated industry. It doesn't matter if you've got the nails, the lashes, the hair or the Barbie image.""

Ford said the show is meant to be raw, but it's not reality TV or a documentary.

""I'm not going to lie. My mom's probably going to tell me to wash my mouth out with some soap,"" Ford said, noting her character is tough-talking, confident and keeps up with the guys.

Mike Vickers plays Ryan, an East Coaster who moved to Alberta to make his fortune in the oil industry. Art imitates life for Vickers who moved to Alberta from Cape Breton.

""When I read the script it was my life. I fell in love with this. It's going to really showcase that true oil and gas grit, the struggles we all face and how we overcome it together as a family,"" Vickers said.

""There's so much opportunity to better the image of this industry and it's how we all come together is how we're going to do this and tell this story.""

Filming in Sundre is expected to wrap up by Aug. 24 and will finish in Nisku, south of Edmonton, by the end of the month.

Michelaine Lahaie, chair of the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for RCMP, says a video shows an RCMP officer opening the door of a moving police vehicle, which hits the man.

article continues below

The officer and other Mounties then use force to arrest him while he's on the ground.

Lahaie says the man was then injured in an alleged assault by another detained man in a cell at the Kinngait RCMP detachment and had to be flown to Iqaluit for medical treatment.

She says the investigation is to determine whether the conduct of the Mounties, including use of force, was reasonable.

She says in a news release that the probe will be a Public Interest Investigation into the conduct of RCMP in Kinngait.

""The RCMP members' conduct will be assessed in accordance with relevant law and RCMP policy,"" reads the terms of reference of the investigation released Tuesday.

""Consideration will also be given as to whether racial bias and/or discrimination played a role in the man's arrest and subsequent treatment.""

Lahaie noted the review she has requested by the commission is separate from an investigation by the Ottawa Police Service at the request of the Mounties and an RCMP internal Code of Conduct review.

""I am concerned with the conduct of RCMP members involved in this serious incident and will monitor both the OPS (Ottawa police) investigation and the RCMP's Code of Conduct investigation,"" Lahaie said in a release.

""The CRCC's investigation will provide an added level of scrutiny to the incident, as it will additionally examine the circumstances that led to the man being placed in a cell at the RCMP detachment where another detainee assaulted him and he needed to be airlifted to Iqaluit for treatment.

""I am aware that there is historical distrust by Inuit toward the police and I am committed to increasing RCMP accountability.""

The day after the man's arrest Nunavut Justice Minister Jeannie Ehaloak said she was outraged.

""I have seen the video from Kinngait circulating on social media and am very concerned by the unnecessary force, the violence and the lack of respect I have seen,'' she said in a release at the time.

""Nunavummiut should not fear this kind of treatment and disregard for safety and basic rights.''

Ehaloak said she would formally request a review by the commission.

The Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the Mounties was created to ensure that public complaints made about the conduct of RCMP members are examined fairly and impartially.

Here is what that means and what could come next.

Word — The term comes through Middle English and Old French from a Latin root, prorogare, to prolong.

article continues below

Effect — Prorogation essentially ends a session of Parliament, allowing for a new beginning with a speech from the throne.

Legislation — At one time, prorogation killed all legislation before Parliament, but rule changes now provide that most bills can be revived in the new session at the same stage they were at when the previous session ended.

Committees — Committees, including special and legislative committees, cease to exist. Membership on committees, except the membership of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, is terminated and all chairs and vice-chairs no longer hold these positions.

Documents — No document may be tabled until the first day of a new session.

Quote — ""Prorogation of a session brings to an end all proceedings before Parliament. With certain exceptions, unfinished business 'dies' on the Order Paper and must be started anew in a subsequent session."" — House of Commons Procedure and Practice, Third Edition, 2017.

Length — Prorogation can be as short as a few hours, or as long as several months. During this period, the House of Commons and Senate are shut down but the government remains in power and MPs remain MPs.

Frequency — Most Parliaments are prorogued at least once and often there are several prorogations and sessions in the life of a Parliament.

Authority — Prorogation is ordered by the Governor General on the advice of the prime minister. It is not covered by statute. Rather it is a personal legal power of the Governor General and by convention the prime minister has the right to provide advice. And by convention it's actually the prime minister's decision.

Granted — Prorogation is routinely granted. In December 2008, then-governor general Michaelle Jean took a few hours before granting prorogation, but that was a thorny case because opposition parties were threatening to defeat the government and install a coalition government shortly after an election.

Ceremony — At one time, prorogation was done in a formal ceremony in the Senate chamber, but that hasn't been used in decades. A simple proclamation signed by the Governor General does the trick today.

Liberal promise — In their 2015 election platform, the Liberals said Stephen Harper's Conservatives ""used prorogation to avoid difficult political circumstances. We will not.""

Limits — Governments can't use prorogation to shut down Parliament indefinitely. That would violate the constitutional requirement that Parliament meet at least once every 12 months. And without Parliament to approve a budget and spending estimates, the government would run out of money.

The relaunch on Nov. 8 will allow all members to book seats on any Air Canada flight using Aeroplan points, a change from the current model where seat inventory is limited.
Current Aeroplan members will keep their account numbers and Aeroplan miles will be converted to points on a one-for-one basis, Air Canada said.
The added incentive to plastic comes as a welcome change for Air Canada credit card partners Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Visa and American Express.
Air Canada has said credit card penetration for so-called elite flyers is only 38 per cent versus about 50 per cent for most U.S. airlines.","MONTREAL — Air Canada is revamping its Aeroplan loyalty program in an effort boost membership amid a global travel industry devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The relaunch on Nov. 8 will allow all members to book seats on any Air Canada flight using Aeroplan points, a change from the current model where seat inventory is limited.

article continues below

It will eliminate the carrier surcharge — which varies from less than $25 to the high hundreds — on flights purchased with points, though a $39 fee applies for trips operated by Air Canada's partner airlines.

Members will also be able to share points with up to eight friends and family members, combining them in a pool anyone in the group may put toward a trip.

The airline hopes the relaunch, planned after it reacquired the rewards program from Aimia Inc. in January 2019, will add another two million members before 2024 to the five million-plus who already hold Aeroplan cards.

The new program, based in part on feedback from thousands of consumers, ""is more important than ever as airlines compete to earn and retain customer loyalty in a rapidly changing environment,"" CEO Calin Rovinescu said in a statement Tuesday.

Passenger revenues at the Montreal-based airline dropped by 95 per cent year over year in its second quarter, prompting 20,000 layoffs as the airline burned through $19 million of cash per day amid border closures and a collapse in demand stemming from the coronavirus.

Air Canada made last-minute tweaks to the rewards revamp in response to the outbreak, prioritizing partnerships with the Uber Eats app and other companies yet to be announced, said Mark Nasr, head of loyalty and e-commerce at the company.

""We did a lot of soul-searching as COVID-19 developed,"" Nasr said. ""We really accelerated these 'every day' partnerships.""

The points that members earn on purchases via eligible retail, hotel and credit card partners will count toward to the tally required to reach the lowest rung of ""elite status"" — 25,000 kilometres of air travel in a year.

For example, an Uber Eats purchase of $50 would yield 100 points for Aeroplan members, and another 50 to 75 points if it was made through a TD Aeroplan Visa card.

Frequent travellers in one of Aeroplan's five elite categories will be able to share benefits such as lounge access and priority boarding with friends and family, even if they are not flying together.

Current Aeroplan members will keep their account numbers and Aeroplan miles will be converted to points on a one-for-one basis, Air Canada said.

The new system will base the number of points earned for a given flight on airfare rather than distance, which currently provides the baseline. That means the points gap between a flight to Asia and a flight across the country will likely narrow, since the difference in distance is often greater than the difference in price.

Meanwhile the new, more flexible pricing model — Air Canada has posted a ""points predictor"" tool on its website — also means more popular routes and times will cost more points than under the current fixed system, while off-peak times and less popular routes will be cheaper, said National Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen.

""We see this as margin-enhancing for Air Canada as it will be able to effectively charge market prices for rewards seats for more popular flights. In addition, it will allow the airline to enhance load factors on less popular flights,"" Doerksen said in a research note.

A flight between Toronto and Vancouver will cost between 25,000 and 35,000 points, according to the points predictor.

The renewed focus on consumer spending — TD announced Tuesday a ""refreshed suite"" of Aeroplan Visa credit cards, set to launch Nov. 8 — expands the loyalty program's potential appeal well beyond the jet set.

""The cards are what drives massive amounts of value. If Bob or Betty don't travel much by air, they can still have a TD or a CIBC or Amex credit card and they can make points on the program,"" said Robert Kokonis, president of Toronto-based consulting firm AirTrav Inc.

""There's all that day-to-day household spending that you can put onto the card that really generates points for the member and through to the bottom line of Aeroplan and then Air Canada.""

The added incentive to plastic comes as a welcome change for Air Canada credit card partners Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Visa and American Express.

Air Canada has said credit card penetration for so-called elite flyers is only 38 per cent versus about 50 per cent for most U.S. airlines.

TD and CIBC paid a total of $1.2 billion to help offset the hefty points liability, acquisition price and other working capital and pension assumptions for Air Canada.

Alonso was sixth on the speed chart when he crashed. He ended up ninth for the day.

""It is just the way it is,"" Alonso said. ""Fortunately it happened today and not on (race day). We will learn from this. Nothing we can do now and tomorrow we start again.""

Alonso is making his third attempt to win the final leg of motorsports' version of the Triple Crown. The two-time Formula One champion has victories in the Monaco Grand Prix and 24 Hours of Le Mans, with Indianapolis the only race missing from the trifecta.

He had a strong car in 2017 when he raced at Indianapolis for Andretti Autorsport but an engine failure ended his shot at victory. Alonso failed to qualify for the Indy 500 last year in an effort from McLaren.

He also crashed during Indy 500 practice last year and it contributed to the many setbacks the McLaren team had during its preparations. The McLaren backup car was not the proper shade of orange and Alonso lost valuable practice time as the colour was corrected.

Alonso's crash with just over 50 minutes remaining in Thursday's session was the first wreck since the track opened Wednesday for practice.

Meanwhile, five-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon topped the speed charts at the end of the day with a lap at 226.102 mph for Chip Ganassi Racing. He was followed by Takuma Sato at 225.693 and Marco Andretti at 225.249 mph as Honda's took the top three spots.

Conor Daly at 225.106 was fourth and the fastest Chevrolet.

James Hinchcliffe of Oakville, Ont., was 17th and Dalton Kellett of Stouffville, Ont., was 28th.

There is one more day of practice before qualifying, called ""Fast Friday"" as IndyCar gives teams a horsepower boost to increase speeds. Defending race winner Simon Pagenaud said Team Penske had a deliberate plan to work on handling Thursday and will worry about speed during Fast Friday practice.

""I have no interest in drafting and getting a big number out there,"" Pagenaud said. ""There's no interest for me to do that. I know I can win this race and I know what I need. That's more important than drafting and putting up a big number."""

Cole Pearn abruptly retired at the end of last year's NASCAR season after helping build one of the best teams in stock car racing. His life on the road cost him too much time with his young family and relocating from Colorado to North Carolina had limited their access to outdoor adventures.

They returned to his native Canada to operate Golden Alpine Holidays in British Columbia, a venture that has been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. Racing has also been scrambled, and when the Indianapolis 500 was moved from May to Aug. 23, one of the Ed Carpenter Racing engineers had a conflict.

It created an opening at Carpenter on Conor Daly's car. One of Carpenter's crew members had worked with Pearn before and the connection was made: Pearn, the crew chief of Martin Truex Jr.'s 2017 NASCAR championship season, would work the Indianapolis 500.

""They asked. It was like, ‘Yeah, why not?’"" said Pearn, who called the Indy 500 a bucket list event. ""It's hard when you race your whole life and just completely turn it all off. So it's kind of nice to scratch that itch at the same time.""

Daly, in his first day working with Pearn, was ninth fastest around Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The Chevrolet was even faster Thursday, when Daly briefly sat atop the speed chart before Takuma Sato bumped him down a spot. He ended the day fourth overall in speed.

""We made some really good changes overnight and Cole has an idea of what he wants to do. He's got an interesting way of working, he's like ‘Yep, I know exactly what I want to do,’"" Daly said. ""I really like communicating with him and I think we are vibing really well.""

Daly, making his seventh Indy 500 start, finished a career-best 10th in his hometown race last season while running for Andretti Autosport. A scrapper who has pieced together a full IndyCar season swapping between Carpenter for oval races and Carlin Racing for street and road course events, the 28-year-old Daly is trying to stabilize his career.

Daly will try to parlay a strong 500 into full-time work while relying on a part-time engineer in the 37-year-old Pearn.

""I’ve learned to just try to get along with everyone,"" Daly said. ""I’m a very trusting individual. Obviously, Cole has an incredible amount of experience in the racing world. Was a driver himself, as well. He knows what’s going on.""

Pearn's most noted success is in stock cars and a five-year stint as Truex's crew chief that produced 24 Cup Series victories. The team raced for the title three consecutive years, finishing second in back-to-back seasons after the 2017 championship.

Things began to change when Furniture Row Racing closed at the end of the 2018 season and Pearn and Truex were pulled into Joe Gibbs Racing. They won seven races and were runner-up to teammate Kyle Busch in the title race when Pearn decided he'd had enough.

He has since watched NASCAR on television and provides both insightful and comedic commentary on social media. Pearn recognized he missed racing.

""For sure missed the competition side,"" Pearn said. ""This is obviously a fully different experience, but racing is still racing. You throw a green and checkered.""

To prepare for Indy, Pearn took a very literal approach — ""I had to read the rule book,"" he said.

He's always followed IndyCar and his racing experience qualifies Pearn for the crossover that few expect will be a difficult transition.

""I grew up knowing these cars, it's not like it's anything crazy,"" Pearn said. ""In some regards it is kind of simple and it's just about understanding the procedures and how we set the cars up, learn how tech goes. The physics is honestly the easiest part, understanding how everything else works is the harder part.""

When Carpenter made the hire, he had no doubt bringing in Pearn would be seamless and give Daly a shot at winning the Indianapolis 500.

""I believe when you bring in smart and talented people that have a work ethic, they’re going to figure it out,"" Carpenter said. ""There’s a lot that’s different but a lot of the processes are the same. Some of the language is different. He’s definitely putting in the work to do it, getting prepared. A lot of what we’re doing at Indy is making decisions in the moment. I think we all feel like Cole has those traits."""

The five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations are upset that Ottawa decided to give a surplus allocation of salmon — which arose this year due to reduced recreational fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic — to commercial fishers rather than to the First Nations.

Clifford Atleo, lead negotiator for one of the nations who is also called Wickaninnish, says he feels sports and commercial troll fishers are given more rights to fish in the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

He says the latest decision to shut First Nations fishers out of an opportunity to catch more chinook salmon this year shows systemic racism is ""alive and well"" within the federal fisheries department.

""We feel very strongly we're not being dealt with fairly, we know we're not being dealt with fairly,"" Atleo said.

""It's just another layer of disappointment on the part of how the government deals with us. The government doesn't realize that their attitude toward our people is dyed-in-the-wool ... And I think the government — sometimes they don't realize they're being racist. They've got age-old policies that have never changed.""

A 2018 B.C. Supreme Court ruling directed Ottawa to take a more ""generous approach"" to allocations of chinook salmon to the First Nations given the importance of this species to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people.

The ruling from B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Humphries noted that the government's salmon allocation policy at the time gave recreational fisherman priority to fish for chinook and soho salmon ahead of the First Nations and advised the fisheries minister to reassess this policy.

Despite this ruling and changes that have since placed the First Nations at a higher priority than sport fishers, the Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ehattesaht and Mowachaht/Muchalaht nations say their yearly fishing allocations have not increased.

This year, the five First Nations were told they could fish 7,724 chinook, which amounts to just 1.5 fish per person for the 5,000 members of their communities.

COVID-19 brought a new dynamic to the salmon allocations this year, as fewer sport fishers were able to come due to pandemic restrictions. This means the recreational fleet is expected to catch 15,000 less salmon than was forecasted for this year, according to figures provided by the department.

None of this surplus is going to the First Nations.

""As per approved management plans, the Area G (commercial) harvest is adjusted based on the projected recreational harvests which results in an increase of 15,000 for 2020,"" said department spokesperson Athina Vazeos.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan was unavailable for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Jennifer Kuss, noted the improvements made in giving the five nations a higher priority in the yearly salmon catch allocations, as directed by the courts.

""This change ensures that food, social, and ceremonial (fishing) continues to be prioritized first, and additionally prioritizes the Five Nations rights-based sale fishery over the recreational and commercial fishery,"" Kuss said in a statement.

The Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations argue Ottawa could have provided some of the unused catch from this year to their people to help them support their remote communities. But Atleo said fisheries officials would not even engage in discussions about it.

""The government is trying to say they consult with us, they negotiate with us. They create their fishing plans, put it on the table and it's like take or leave it,"" Atleo said.

""All we want to do is be part of the economy, part of looking after ourselves without depending on government. We don't think that's a lot to ask.""

NDP MP Gord Johns, whose riding takes in the West Coast fishing shores, said he finds it ""disgusting"" the Trudeau government has repeatedly highlighted its desire to restore the Crown's relationship with Indigenous Peoples but has still fought many legal battles with these nations over their fishing rights.

""Indigenous people in our communities rely on this fishery for their economy, for their food security, for their culture. It's part of their way of life. These are salt water people and they rely on the salmon and to be denied their right is shameful, it's disgusting that the government is taking this approach.""

The First Nations are calling on Ottawa to revisit its decision on the surplus salmon for this year to allow them a portion of the additional catch.

""The government has an opportunity to fix this with these (surplus salmon) to come with a fair opportunity to exercise their commitment, in the judge's words, for a generous allocation to the nations and to start moving forward with reconciliation,"" Johns said.

The minister's spokeswoman says Jordan takes any allegations of systemic racism ""very seriously"" and that Ottawa is working with the five nations on a reconciliation agreement on fisheries resources, which is intended to broaden their access in the area, Kuss said.

""The road to reconciliation is a long journey, and Canada is committed to moving forward together. The department has spoken with the five nations on the reallocation of (salmon catch) on multiple occasions and that open dialogue will continue.""

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

""It was nice to get on the board tonight,"" said O'Reilly.

""I haven't been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it's just one game. I've got to be consistent with it.""

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

""When we take care of the puck it's effective and it's hard on them,"" said O'Reilly.

""I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We've got to stick to our structure.""

Pietrangelo said they've been working on fixing the penalty kill.

""We've been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,"" he said.

""Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.""

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

""They're blocking a lot of shots, they're studying us. They kind of know what we're doing,"" said Miller.

He said they'll make adjustments but aren't going to go back to square one.

""We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,"" he said.

""It's not like we're getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They're a good team. We're a good team. It's going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.""

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O'Reilly, last year's Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play — the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O'Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O'Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler's stick and in.

O'Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club.","TORONTO — Richard Clune remembers the drive — the pain, the anxiety, the uncertainty, the fear.

It was the spring of 2010 and Clune, who had made his NHL debut earlier that season, was finally on the road to getting the help the 23-year-old knew he needed in his crippling addiction battle.

With his younger brother, Matt, at the wheel, they drove through upstate New York in a torrential downpour home to Toronto. Clune wasn't sure he was going to make it.

""I was in the acute withdrawal phase,"" he said in a recent interview with The Canadian Press. ""I couldn't sit still for a second. The most logical thing at that point in time for me was to go jump off a bridge ... literally.

""I couldn't really see myself coming out of it.""

But come out of it he did, and a decade later, Clune is sharing his story in ""Hi, My Name is Dicky,"" a raw documentary available on iTunes and AppleTV that details his life from aspiring youth hockey player to out-of-control junior antagonist to pro athlete teetering on the edge — one consumed by drugs, alcohol and mental illness.

His journey to recovery started in earnest on that lonely stretch of highway.

""My brother really had to talk me off the ledge,"" Clune said. ""When I see his face and when I see my other brother Ben's face, that's what gave me strength to live, because I didn't really want to live for myself at that time.

""Matt, at a couple points on that drive, had to do things that no younger brother should have to do and really dig down deep and get me home.""

The documentary from Taylor Prestidge and Haris Usanovic of Upper Canada Films tracks Clune's life and career, recovery and redemption. It includes interviews with Clune's parents, brothers, teammates and coaches.

Clune was driven to be the best as a child, but the pressure led him down a dark path at early age.

""I made that decision I was going to put my head down and not see anything but being a hockey player,"" Clune, who was selected in the third round of the 2005 NHL draft by the Dallas Stars, says in the film.

He began to try alcohol in his early teens as a way to cope, and it escalated quickly once he got to high school and then the Ontario Hockey League.

""I had this hole inside me that made me insecure and afraid of the world,"" Clune recounts. ""I got wasted and was like, 'Wow. OK. I'll be able to do this. I can cope with this. It's like a warm blanket.'

""Alcohol saved me. It was my solution to that problem of being self-absorbed and focused on all the things that made me insecure and self-conscious and in pain and sad.""

But he didn't realize how much of a spiral his life was taking. In junior, he would drive from bar to bar, party to party, drinking, smoking marjiuana and doing cocaine.

""I wanted to walk that line of looking death in the face every day, but still play hockey and do all these things,"" Clune says in the film. ""I don't know how I did it.""

Things got worse after junior when he was living in the United States by himself before making his NHL debut in that fateful 2009-10 season, months before becoming completely unglued.

""I had achieved my goal,"" he recalls on screen. ""But I hated myself.""

Clune eventually checked into rehab a second time — he went once before, but didn't stay — and committed to getting better with a lot of help from the people around him.

After he got out, he resumed his career and went onto play a total of 120 regular-season games in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Nashville Predators. His contract was bought out in 2015, and he was again at a crossroads — retire or keep going.

That's when the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were in the early stages of their massive rebuild, came calling to see if Clune wanted to be part of their program. They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club. At the very least, he would play in the minors and help foster a new culture.

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, who was in charge of the minor-league Marlies at the time, saw something in Clune that could be useful.

""He provides a certain energy,"" Dubas said. ""He provides experience in his life that I thought brought a great spirit to our team.""

Clune played 19 games with Leafs, but the forward truly made his mark with the Marlies. He helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018 and plans to continue his on-ice career, but equally important was how he's helped mentor a number of current NHLers.

He's proud of where he is, and not shy talking about how he got there. Clune still goes to meetings, does the 12 steps and now works to help others.

He also thinks a lot about why he made the decision to live, to fight, and get better, when many others — including some fellow pro hockey players — have gone down a different path.

""In the beginning, it was because I wanted to see my brothers,"" said Clune, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Then it transformed into wanting to live for myself. I started to discover what it feels like to have self esteem and to have love.

""I just hope people realize that they're not alone with how they feel. Don't be afraid to ask for help.""

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday.
""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League.

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

article continues below

""After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,"" Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal's three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first overall by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

""A low-maintenance superstar,"" said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg's senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At five foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn't blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack of getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday. ""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League. I think it was Dale's arrival that really cemented the future of the franchise and I think we all have recollections of that first year, that Calder (Trophy) year and then everything that would follow.

""He was truly a superstar as a hockey player, but I think why he was so loved here was not just that but largely the fact that he made this his home and became one of us. I think everybody shared that sense of pride in Dale's career as a player.""

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: ""All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL's all time greatest players.""

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

""What an incredible human being,"" Selanne tweeted.

Montreal Canadiens associate coach Kirk Muller also had a chance to speak with Hawerchuk in recent days.

""I talked to Dale a few days ago, and we had a good chance to chat. A good friend, had a real good opportunity to play against one of the all-time best players. As a hockey player, we all know how great he was, but he was a good friend and just a really special person, did a lot for charities. It's a real loss for us in the hockey world.""

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk ""one of the most decorated players in our game's history.""

In September 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

""For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I'm ready to fight it,"" he told TSN in October 2019. ""I want to live to tell the story.""

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie's bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames players Andrew Mangiapane and Rasmus Andersson remembered playing for Hawerchuk in Barrie.

""I don't know where I'd be without him,"" said Mangiapane. ""Very sad news today. I owe my career basically to him and the whole Barrie organization.""

Andersson, from Sweden, said ""Dale was a fantastic human being. Such a great person. My first week in Barrie he invited us over to his house and really just welcomed me to Canada. I cannot say enough good things about him as a person. Obviously a real good coach, too.""

""It's awful news.""

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday's opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at age two and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur's record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

""I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive — well maybe a little further now with the traffic,"" he said. ""I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""

""I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,"" he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and '81 with teammates that included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL's top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt like he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year — the youngest recipient at the time — and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

""Just one of the greatest. You could tell from day one. We knew from when he was 18 years old as a player that he would turn the (Jets) franchise around. Certainly one of the best I’ve ever played with and coached,"" said Dallas Stars coach Rick Bowness, who played with and coached Hawerchuk in the '80s.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

""He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,"" said Mike Doran, Winnipeg's director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the faceoff in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux's famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

""It turned out fantastic,"" said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada's call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets ""are etched in my mind every day that I live.""

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes' ring of honour.

Hawerchuk re-wrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia whom he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

""It's like going back down memory lane,"" he said in his induction speech.

""All the experiences have been fantastic,"" he added. ""I mean, sometimes they didn't feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing ... Even though I didn't win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn't change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.""

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets' Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November 2017.

""Tonight we fly Ducky's number high,"" said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue's ""Home Sweet Home,"" before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

""Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,"" said the PA announcer.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

""I've been to every part of (Manitoba), either golfing or playing (softball),"" Hawerchuk said. ""I've gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I'm honoured and I'm very humbled.""

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.

And that includes how to allow players under contract to CFL teams the ability to sign elsewhere — most notably the NFL — if the opportunity arises. On Monday, the CFL cancelled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The focus right now for us on a few certain things and one of them is ensuring if there's an ability for our players to receive some form of payment this year,"" Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA's executive director, said Monday during a conference call. ""They should be able to do that if they have an opportunity.""

While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season. However, 66 players have currently opted out of participating in the 2020 campaign, which could create opportunity for some CFL players to sign deals south of the border and have a chance to earn a football paycheque, either on the active roster or on the practice squad.

While there's no shortage of collegiate players available, the advantage a CFL player has is pro experience, a fact not lost upon NFL personnel people.

The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign. This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.

And players on NFL practice rosters receive at least US$8,000 per week.

Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the CFL is amendable to doing what it can to help its players.

""Where we can do something we will,"" he said. ""We're going to be committed to working towards good outcomes, the best possible outcomes we can have with out players.

""That's not going to mean we're going to be able to do everything but we're certainly going to go into this with a real positive spirit.""

Something else that will be on the CFL-CFLPA radar will be the current collective bargaining agreement, which is slated to expire after the 2021 season. But union president Solomon Elimimian said the two sides covered a lot of ground this time around during talks to amend the agreement for a shortened '20 season.

""Whether we deal with '21 when it comes or after the '21 season I think there's hope there that we can work together,"" Elimimian said. ""Obviously the relationship between the players and the league needs to be one where the players feel appreciated.

""Everyone wants to the league to reach its full potential. The partnership has to be one that's very genuine and the players have to feel part of that. If that happens, the sky is the limit.""

Cavan Biggio also went deep for the Blue Jays and finished with three hits and three RBIs.

Ryu (2-1) struck out three and walked none. The left-hander permitted only one runner past second base and yielded just one extra-base hit to a team that came in ranked second in the majors with a .467 slugging percentage.

Rather than vie for strikeouts, Ryu said he was focused more on getting the Orioles to hit the ball weakly.

""I was able to keep them off balance,"" he said through an interpreter.

Signed in December to an $80 million, four-year contract, Ryu got off to a shaky start with Toronto in July before showing the form he displayed as a star with the Dodgers. He's given up a total of two runs in his last three starts after allowing eight runs over nine innings in his first two outings.

""That was vintage Ryu,"" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. ""Ryu was outstanding. That's the reason we won the game.""

The two home runs were a factor, but mostly Ryu was the difference-maker.

""They didn’t give Ryu that big contract for nothing,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""You just never know what he’s going to throw. You don’t know what side of the plate he’s going to throw to. He’s really tough on right-handers because he can locate it in. You saw a lot of us get jammed.""

The Blue Jays took control with a four-run third against Alex Cobb (1-2). Three infield hits produced a run before Grichuk delivered a three-run drive over the centre-field wall. It was his third home run of the season, all in the last four games.

""Obviously, the pitch to Grichuk was middle middle and it was a poorly executed pitch,"" Cobb said. ""But most of the pitches that I had, I felt like I executed. I got the results.""

Cobb gave up five runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He’s winless in his last four starts.

After hitting 31 homers last year, Grichuk was batting fifth, sixth or seventh in the order this season before Montoyo decided to move him into the No. 2 spot Sunday to replace injured Bo Bichette. Over the past two games, Grichuk has two homers, four hits and six RBIs.

Pedro Severino and Renato Núñez had RBIs for the Orioles, who have dropped two straight after winning seven of eight.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Bichette (right knee sprain) had an MRI and will receive a second opinion on his injury, Montoyo said. Bichette leads Toronto with a .361 batting average.

Orioles: RH Dillon Tate (elbow contusion) came off the injured list and RH Evan Phillips was optioned to the team's alternate site.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: RH Nate Pearson (0-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his fourth start in his first big league season Tuesday night. Drafted 28th overall in 2017, the 23-year-old is looking to rebound after giving up four runs to Miami last week in 2 1/3 innings. ""I'm developing at the highest level,"" Pearson said Monday. ""When I don't have my best stuff, I'm going to struggle.""

Orioles: LH Wade LeBlanc (1-0, 7.13) has allowed a combined 10 runs over 12 innings in his last three starts.

DeBrusk scored twice while the Bruins scored four straight goals to rally and beat the Hurricanes 4-3 on Monday to take a 3-1 lead in their first-round playoff series.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

""We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,"" Marchand said. ""That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.""

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

""We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do — little battles,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.""

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President's Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk's first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy's hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina's captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy putaway from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston's first six post-season games.

""There's other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.""

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen's late goal.

""That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,"" Williams said. ""We got it handed to us.""

Alonso crashed in Turn 4 when his Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet dipped onto the concrete portion of the apron at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and sent the Spaniard into the retaining wall. His damaged car rolled onto pit lane for an early end to his afternoon.

Alonso was sixth on the speed chart when he crashed. He ended up ninth for the day.

""It is just the way it is,"" Alonso said. ""Fortunately it happened today and not on (race day). We will learn from this. Nothing we can do now and tomorrow we start again.""

Alonso is making his third attempt to win the final leg of motorsports' version of the Triple Crown. The two-time Formula One champion has victories in the Monaco Grand Prix and 24 Hours of Le Mans, with Indianapolis the only race missing from the trifecta.

He had a strong car in 2017 when he raced at Indianapolis for Andretti Autorsport but an engine failure ended his shot at victory. Alonso failed to qualify for the Indy 500 last year in an effort from McLaren.

He also crashed during Indy 500 practice last year and it contributed to the many setbacks the McLaren team had during its preparations. The McLaren backup car was not the proper shade of orange and Alonso lost valuable practice time as the colour was corrected.

Alonso's crash with just over 50 minutes remaining in Thursday's session was the first wreck since the track opened Wednesday for practice.

Meanwhile, five-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon topped the speed charts at the end of the day with a lap at 226.102 mph for Chip Ganassi Racing. He was followed by Takuma Sato at 225.693 and Marco Andretti at 225.249 mph as Honda's took the top three spots.

Conor Daly at 225.106 was fourth and the fastest Chevrolet.

James Hinchcliffe of Oakville, Ont., was 17th and Dalton Kellett of Stouffville, Ont., was 28th.

There is one more day of practice before qualifying, called ""Fast Friday"" as IndyCar gives teams a horsepower boost to increase speeds. Defending race winner Simon Pagenaud said Team Penske had a deliberate plan to work on handling Thursday and will worry about speed during Fast Friday practice.

""I have no interest in drafting and getting a big number out there,"" Pagenaud said. ""There's no interest for me to do that. I know I can win this race and I know what I need. That's more important than drafting and putting up a big number."""

Cole Pearn abruptly retired at the end of last year's NASCAR season after helping build one of the best teams in stock car racing. His life on the road cost him too much time with his young family and relocating from Colorado to North Carolina had limited their access to outdoor adventures.

They returned to his native Canada to operate Golden Alpine Holidays in British Columbia, a venture that has been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. Racing has also been scrambled, and when the Indianapolis 500 was moved from May to Aug. 23, one of the Ed Carpenter Racing engineers had a conflict.

It created an opening at Carpenter on Conor Daly's car. One of Carpenter's crew members had worked with Pearn before and the connection was made: Pearn, the crew chief of Martin Truex Jr.'s 2017 NASCAR championship season, would work the Indianapolis 500.

""They asked. It was like, ‘Yeah, why not?’"" said Pearn, who called the Indy 500 a bucket list event. ""It's hard when you race your whole life and just completely turn it all off. So it's kind of nice to scratch that itch at the same time.""

Daly, in his first day working with Pearn, was ninth fastest around Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The Chevrolet was even faster Thursday, when Daly briefly sat atop the speed chart before Takuma Sato bumped him down a spot. He ended the day fourth overall in speed.

""We made some really good changes overnight and Cole has an idea of what he wants to do. He's got an interesting way of working, he's like ‘Yep, I know exactly what I want to do,’"" Daly said. ""I really like communicating with him and I think we are vibing really well.""

Daly, making his seventh Indy 500 start, finished a career-best 10th in his hometown race last season while running for Andretti Autosport. A scrapper who has pieced together a full IndyCar season swapping between Carpenter for oval races and Carlin Racing for street and road course events, the 28-year-old Daly is trying to stabilize his career.

Daly will try to parlay a strong 500 into full-time work while relying on a part-time engineer in the 37-year-old Pearn.

""I’ve learned to just try to get along with everyone,"" Daly said. ""I’m a very trusting individual. Obviously, Cole has an incredible amount of experience in the racing world. Was a driver himself, as well. He knows what’s going on.""

Pearn's most noted success is in stock cars and a five-year stint as Truex's crew chief that produced 24 Cup Series victories. The team raced for the title three consecutive years, finishing second in back-to-back seasons after the 2017 championship.

Things began to change when Furniture Row Racing closed at the end of the 2018 season and Pearn and Truex were pulled into Joe Gibbs Racing. They won seven races and were runner-up to teammate Kyle Busch in the title race when Pearn decided he'd had enough.

He has since watched NASCAR on television and provides both insightful and comedic commentary on social media. Pearn recognized he missed racing.

""For sure missed the competition side,"" Pearn said. ""This is obviously a fully different experience, but racing is still racing. You throw a green and checkered.""

To prepare for Indy, Pearn took a very literal approach — ""I had to read the rule book,"" he said.

He's always followed IndyCar and his racing experience qualifies Pearn for the crossover that few expect will be a difficult transition.

""I grew up knowing these cars, it's not like it's anything crazy,"" Pearn said. ""In some regards it is kind of simple and it's just about understanding the procedures and how we set the cars up, learn how tech goes. The physics is honestly the easiest part, understanding how everything else works is the harder part.""

When Carpenter made the hire, he had no doubt bringing in Pearn would be seamless and give Daly a shot at winning the Indianapolis 500.

""I believe when you bring in smart and talented people that have a work ethic, they’re going to figure it out,"" Carpenter said. ""There’s a lot that’s different but a lot of the processes are the same. Some of the language is different. He’s definitely putting in the work to do it, getting prepared. A lot of what we’re doing at Indy is making decisions in the moment. I think we all feel like Cole has those traits."""

Unifor, which represents about 20,000 Canadian workers between the three companies, said the recent COVID-19 pandemic has stoked uncertainty about future job security as economies struggle.

""This round of talks is especially unique and challenging,"" said the union, on its website outlining the auto talks. ""This year's contract talks will pivot on good jobs and future investment.""

Ford also said that ""global economic uncertainties"" have stressed the importance of maintaining jobs in Canada.

""We'll be asking our employees to work with us to help shape this new reality together,"" said spokeswoman Rose Pao in a statement.

The negotiations will focus on collective agreements that expire Sept. 21. The union said that it will identify on Sept. 8 its ""strike target"" — the manufacturer it will target first to set a pattern for the other agreements.

Unifor national president Jerry Dias says he will be on the lookout for any attempts by the manufacturers to use COVID-19 as an ""excuse."" He says other than improving wage increases, he expects major battlegrounds will be a new product investment from Ford in Oakville, putting a stop to outsourcing Ford parts depots, and restoring the third shift in Fiat Chrysler's Windsor and Brampton facilities. Dias is also eyeing the 2023 expiration of major programs in GM's powertrain operation in St. Catharines.

While recent trade policy changes, when enacted, will improve the state of play, Dias says the government needs to do more to attract electric vehicle investments to Canada.

""This is an industry that pays a lot of taxes,"" says Dias. ""And it's a lot of jobs. So everybody's going to have to start to row together in the right direction.""

Ian Lee, associate professor of management at Sprott School of Business at Carleton University, says the economic pressure on the auto industry has created an uphill battle for unions.

""GM, Ford, FCA, I think they're increasingly in the driver's seat,"" says Lee.

""Unifor, in these upcoming negotiations, they're in the fight of their life. I think that there is not going to be so much on wages. I think it's going to be, 'Can we save the plants that are left?'""

The new round of negotiations come as the industry is still dealing with fallout from the novel coronavirus. For example, FCA plants in Canada were down from March 18 to May 4, and GM plants were closed between March 16 and May 25, after which they gradually reopened.

Like previous recessions, auto sales also sputtered during the early months of the COVID-19 outbreak. DesRosiers Automotive Consultants Inc. said that auto sales plunged 48 per cent year-over-year in March, but by July, sales had fallen just 4.9 per cent, the smallest decrease since the pandemic began.

Nonetheless, DesRosiers predicted that annual sales rates will remain flat for one to two years.

The new negotiations will be set against the background of the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which went into force July 1.

The deal included a provision that a significant percentage of the value of a car be produced by workers earning the equivalent of at least US$16 per hour, something the Canadian government said could improve Canadian automotive manufacturing's competitiveness compared to that of Mexico.

While some trade policy changes, when enacted, will improve the state of play, Dias says the government needs to do more to attract electric vehicle investments to Canada.

""This is an industry that pays a lot of taxes,"" says Dias. ""And it's a lot of jobs. So everybody's going to have to start to row together in the right direction.""

Between 1999 and 2017, Canada dropped to the No. 10 auto manufacturing country in the world, down from No. 4 in 1999, Unifor previously estimated.

""Mexico is building smaller cars, in a threat to Canada. But I've argued that the biggest threat to Canada is not Mexico. It's the southern United States,"" says Lee.

""In the American South, it's not only wages that are lower ... taxes are lower, state taxes are lower, land costs are lower, cost of living is lower.""

In 2016, GM was targeted by the union, which cited the company's financial surplus and asked for new allocations for vehicles and powertrain and better incentives for new hires and retirees.

The agreements, which can be hundreds of pages in length, ended up converting 700 jobs at GM and securing a $713-million investment and 500 jobs from Ford, among other issues.

Last year marked the culmination of downsizing at a GM plant in Oshawa, Ont. The plant east of Toronto now has about 300 workers, down from about 2,600.

""There's going to be a great temptation for the three companies: When they close down these particular cars as a segment, they will not replace them. If you don't replace them, you close up a plant,"" says Lee.

GM, in a motion last week, alleged that Fiat Chrysler used foreign bank accounts to bribe union officials so they would stick GM with higher labour costs.

article continues below

But in a response, the Italian-American automaker fired back, calling GM’s claims ""defamatory and baseless.""

GM alleged in its motion that FCA spent millions on bribes by stashing the money in foreign accounts. The assertion that there is new evidence came as GM asked a federal judge to reconsider his July dismissal of a federal racketeering lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler.

In trying to revive the lawsuit, GM alleged that bribes were paid to two former United Auto Workers presidents, as well as a former union vice-president and at least one former GM employee.

In its response, Fiat Chrysler said the judge should deny GM's motion. GM, FCA said, has to know that the prospect of getting the judge to overturn the dismissal is slim to none. ""So this motion is apparently a vehicle to make more defamatory and baseless accusations about a competitor that is winning in the marketplace.""

FCA denied allegations by GM that FCA paid two ""moles"" to infiltrate GM and send inside information. The company also denied that foreign bank accounts were involved. ""That GM has extended its attacks to individual FCA officers and employees, making wild allegations against them without a shred of factual support, is despicable,"" FCA lawyers wrote.

GM's claims are based on the alleged existence of foreign bank accounts, which are legal, Fiat Chrysler wrote. ""There is not one well-pled allegation in the proposed amended complaint (by GM) that these foreign bank accounts were used to pay bribes or facilitate any other illegal conduct,"" FCA's response said.

GM contends that bribes were paid to former United Auto Workers Presidents Dennis Williams and Ron Gettelfinger, as well as Vice-President Joe Ashton. It also alleges money was paid to GM employees including Al Iacobelli, a former FCA labour negotiator who was hired and later released by GM.

GM alleges that payments were made so the officials would saddle GM with more than $1 billion in additional labour costs.

Gettelfinger, whose name had not come up previously in a wide-ranging federal probe of UAW corruption, vehemently denied the allegations in a statement and said he had no foreign accounts. Williams’ California home was raided by federal agents but he has not been charged. Iacobelli, who is awaiting sentencing in the probe, also denied the claims.

In July, U.S. District Judge Paul Borman in Detroit tossed out GM’s lawsuit that alleged that Fiat Chrysler paid off union leaders to get better contract terms than GM.

He wrote that GM’s alleged injuries were not caused by FCA violating federal racketeering laws, and that the people harmed by the bribery scheme were Fiat Chrysler workers.

GM’s motion contended that payments were made to accounts in places like Switzerland, Luxembourg, Italy, Singapore and the Cayman Islands. The accounts were set up to avoid detection in the federal criminal probe, according to the motion. The accounts were discovered recently by private investigators working on GM’s behalf, according to court records."

The Mustang II was built through the 1978 model year, then replaced by the 1979 Fairmont-based, third-generation Mustang.
Many Mustang enthusiasts disdained the Mustang II as a wimpy aberration, not a “real” Mustang.","Even though the original Ford Mustang introduced in mid-1964 was based on modest Ford Falcon components, it was an instant sensation. The attractive four-passenger two-door sportster set a first model year sales record of 680,989, admittedly a long one that ran from April ’64 to August ’65. It caught the competition so off guard it took rival Chevrolet until the 1967 model year to respond with its Camaro.

The Mustang made Ford’s general manager Lee Iacocca a household name and put his picture on the cover of both Time and Newsweek. It also spawned a class of vehicle known as the Pony Car.

article continues below

As inevitably seems to happen, the Mustang grew bigger and heavier. By 1973 it was about 305 millimetres longer, 152 mm wider and about 272 kilograms heavier than the original.

The Mustang had outgrown its original appeal as an affordable, nimble sporty car. As Iacocca summed up: “The Mustang market never left us, we left it.”

Sales confirmed this, sliding from more than 600,000 in model year 1966, to just 134,267 in 1973. What’s more, new, lighter, imported 2+2 mini-Pony Cars combining four-on-the-floor fun with upscale luxury were becoming increasingly popular. They were filling the segment Mustang had created and gradually abandoned.

Cars such as the Toyota Celica and Ford’s own German Capri (sold by Lincoln-Mercury dealers, and ironically inspired by the original Mustang), were the stimulus for a new, smaller Mustang to try recapturing the earlier magic.

Plans for the trimmer 1974 Mustang began in 1970, and just as the original was based on mundane Falcon components, the new one used the new-for-1971 subcompact Ford Pinto as its foundation. This complete departure was called the Mustang II.

Iacocca specified a wheelbase of 2,438 to 2,540 mm in notchback and fastback coupes. This precluded using a long engine, so a 2.3-litre, overhead cam inline four was the base power with a 2.8- litre, overhead valve V-6 optional, and standard in the upscale Mustang II Mach I. The four was the U.S.-built Pinto engine while the option was a stretch of the Capri’s 2.6 litre V-6 from Germany.

Ford’s engineers took downsizing seriously and made the Mustang II even smaller than the original. The wheelbase was reduced from 2,743 mm to 2,443 mm and ove-all length from 4,613 mm to 4,445 mm. It was a full 508 mm shorter and 102 mm narrower than the bloated ’73 model it replaced.

In spite of its smaller size, mandated safety and emission equipment brought the unit construction Mustang II’s weighy to 1,270 kg, a little heavier than the original’s 1,179 kg.

The attractive styling was influenced by coachbuilder Ghia of Italy, recently acquired by Ford, and carried on the long-hood, short-deck theme of the original. It came as a notchback and hatch-equipped fastback.

The Mustang II was no match for the original’s performance. Road & Track (8/64) reported the original 4.7 litre (289 cu in.) V-8 Mustang sprinted to 97 km/h (60 mph) in 9.0 seconds and had a top speed of 177 (110).

The Mustang II Mach I with the 2.8 litre V-6 (R&T 9/73) ran zero to 97 (60) in 13.8 seconds with top speed of 161 (100). The four was, of course, even slower.

When Ford advertised the new 1974 Mustang as “The right car at the right time,” they couldn’t have known how prescient they would be. In November 1973, conditions changed dramatically when the Arab oil embargo precipitated the first of two 1970s “energy crises.”

Not only did gasoline prices spike but its supply was rumoured to be in jeopardy. Fuel economy immediately became the hot item and helped boost the smaller Mustang’s first calendar year sales to 385,993.

With oil crisis memories fading by 1975, Ford offered a 5.0-litre V-8 in the Mustang II, bringing performance closer to the original’s. R&T (1/75) recorded zero to 97 km/h (60 mph) in 10.5 seconds and top speed of 171 (106).

A Cobra II with options such as extra trim, black grille, front air dam and rear spoiler came in 1976. There was also a Stallion package with different paint treatment and stallion decals on the front fenders. For 1978 there was the even more garish King Cobra with standard 5.0-litre V-8, deeper air dam, stripes and a cobra decal on the hood.

The Mustang II was built through the 1978 model year, then replaced by the 1979 Fairmont-based, third-generation Mustang. Many Mustang enthusiasts disdained the Mustang II as a wimpy aberration, not a “real” Mustang. It was, however, a product of its time and became a desirable collectible for many."

Dysfunction-By-The-Sea is truly a place in Backward Columbia. Try Suicide Lanes by the Sea. Yes, the City of Victoria seems to want to solve problems that do not exist. Longtime residents of Victoria can remember the giant traffic circle at the Douglas-Hillside-Gorge intersection. According to those who are still alive, it worked very well. Traffic flowed in one direction, eliminating the dreaded head-on and T-bone crash potential. This functioning roundabout was replaced with a brand-new toy, signalized traffic lights. Proving once again you can always tell an engineer, but not very much. Giving up on a proven technology in favour of an unproven new toy is their eternal fault. Their heralded advancements are much appreciated, but every so often, they overreach. Frankly, we cannot live without engineers, but every so often, we could do without their shiny new toy.

The ultra-brand-new toy is the shared lane insanity about to be hoisted upon an unsuspecting commuting public.

The one-block trial, where a single lane, referred to as a Suicide lane in the old days, is intended to serve opposite motor vehicle directional travel. Once a driver comes face-to-face with another car driver in the single provided road lane, it is expected that each would swerve right. This action takes the drivers into the well-marked, same direction, painted bike lanes on each side of the street.

By the way, bike riders are not restricted to these well-marked bike lanes. Drivers will not only have to make a right shoulder check before moving right from the suicide lane, but also check their left shoulder before returning to the suicide lane, since bike riders are not restricted to bike lanes.

I have nothing against bikes. I like bike riders. The more bike riders, the fewer cars needed to get from A to B. This odd new toy will be especially difficult for visitors to our city. Who in their right mind, would choose a city block, with a major hotel complex, to do a first run of this unnecessary matrix? What do visitors to the hotel think? Is this block of Humboldt street a high crash site? Is it the location of fatal crashes?

Richardson Avenue is another future disaster in the making. The plan is to do the same configuration on this commuter arterial. Crash rates and vehicle volume do not justify the proposed suicide-lane modifications. Residents are up in arms and cyclists are not of one mind when it comes to these revolutionary changes.

• If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it! This phrase comes to mind when referencing not only Richardson, but also Vancouver street. Richardson is a connector street, and a low stress way to get to and from the Tweed Curtain, known as Oak Bay. The death rate on Richardson must be astronomically high for such changes to be proposed. It is not!

The Vancouver Street directional changes are different than others referenced. The plan is to do major capital expense, namely concrete and stationary construction, in order to physically block and re-route motor vehicle traffic. Vancouver Street will no longer be a through street for motor vehicles. The 4,000 to 5,000 vehicles using the street will be diverted to Quadra or Cook. These streets are already stressed during morning and afternoon commutes.

Why are any of these projects being considered at this time of municipal financial crisis?

City council would be wise to delay in this time of a never before experienced financially stressful pandemic.

It won't be in May, it won't be in front of hundreds of thousands of fans, and many of the other rituals associated with the race will be altered due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

But Kellett still got to take in one of the traditions.

""One cool thing that they did do is every year they rename the streets downtown with the drivers' last names,"" said Kellet. ""So there's a street called Kellett Avenue in downtown Indianapolis right now. I went down and took a picture of that the other day.""

The 26-year-old noted that most of the race's traditions revolve around spectators and fan interaction, which he said he considers a real loss for this year's Indy 500. However, he's still looking forward to the pre-race process should he qualify for the race on Saturday.

""Lining up the cars on the front straightaway, 11 rows of three, the pageantry, the history behind the race, it's what makes you realize how big an event it is,"" said Kellett.

Kellett, from Stouffville, Ont., is in the midst of his rookie IndyCar season, albeit one that has been shortened and re-arranged by the COVID-19 pandemic. He's competed in three races so far this season, the GMR Grand Prix (21st) and Road America (20th in both races).

""I think given the lack of track time and testing I'm content with what we've done so far,"" said Kellett. ""Obviously, we want to be competing a little bit further up the course on the road course but I think that will just be a process of learning and getting up to speed with everything.

Practice laps continued on so-called ""Fast Friday"" as IndyCar gives teams a horsepower boost to increase speeds. Fellow Canadian James Hinchcliffe of Oakville, Ont., was seventh overall after Marco Andretti posted the fastest Friday lap since 1996 to finish the day first overall.

""Coming into today with the extra boost there were a lot of unknowns, but it was awesome to get out there and start knocking out 230’s from the first run,"" said Hinchcliffe, whose time was 38.7987 seconds. ""We ran through our program , and I think we made some good progress.""

Kellett was 28th with a time of 39.2844 seconds.

""Just finished up my first Fast Friday. I feel like I can finally breathe now. It was a long day of qualifying runs,"" said Kellett. ""I think we’ve got a good compromise between outright speed and also just having the car for the entire four laps.""

Qualifying will be on Saturday with the race itself on Aug. 23. Should he qualify to race, it will be a dream come true for Kellett, whose favourite Indy 500 moment was when Jacques Villeneuve of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que., won in 1995.

""It would be the biggest race of my career and the culmination of a lot of years of hard work coming through the junior ranks,"" Kellett said. ""It would be a big moment. I can't emphasize enough how exciting it would be to be in the field of 33 and represent Canada and represent A.J. Foyt racing.""

The 104th running of ""The Greatest Spectacle in Racing"" will be the first without spectators, who showed up at Indianapolis Motor Speedway every year, even during the Great Depression.

It was a flip for Penske, who purchased the iconic speedway in January and has spent every day since upgrading his new showplace to prepare for his favourite race. The pandemic forced the race to change dates for the first time, from Memorial Day weekend to Aug. 23.

article continues below

Penske had initially said he wouldn't run the 500 without fans. But as the pandemic continued to spread across the nation, the decision was made to limit capacity to 50%. The speedway then lowered that number to 25% and presented an 88-page manual on how to safely host spectators.

Cases have continued to rise — steadily in Indiana and specifically in Marion County, where the speedway is located — and Penske told The Associated Press on Tuesday the reversal on the spectator policy was ""the toughest business decision I've ever made in my life.""

""We didn't buy the Speedway for one year, we bought it for generations to come, and it's important to our reputation to do the right thing,"" Penske said in a telephone interview.

He said the financial ramifications of not hosting spectators — which even at 25% capacity, the mammoth facility could have held about 80,000 people — played no part in his decision. Rather, the continued increase of COVID-19 cases in Marion County made shutting out spectators the responsible decision.

""We need to be safe and smart about this,"" Penske said. ""Obviously we want full attendance, but we don't want to jeopardize the health and safety of our fans and the community. We also don't want to jeopardize the ability to hold a successful race.""

As part of the plan introduced two weeks ago for 25% of fan capacity, spectators who had purchased badges that granted them access to the garage and pit lane was going to be permitted, as well as infield access. Although the speedway, which can hold at least 350,000 spectators, has the space for social distancing, Penske did not want to put fans or competitors at risk.

The situation was compounded last week when IU Health, the state’s largest health care system and a partner of Indianapolis Motor Speedway, said it opposed fans attending the 500.

""Until we sustain better control of this virus and its spread,"" IU Health said in a statement, ""we strongly encourage IMS to consider an alternative to running the Indy 500 with fans in August.""

The letter blindsided speedway officials, who had worked with health officials on the comprehensive safety plan that included mandatory wearing of masks at all times inside the speedway.

IU Health said it ""appreciates"" the speedway's safety plan, but risks remained too high to host a large cluster of fans.

""We have concerns about the risks of infection beyond the scope of the IMS plan, including social gatherings, travel, restaurants, bars, accommodations and other event-related activities,"" IU Health said. ""This could lead to a spike in COVID-19 infections as we continue to see cases and hospitalizations increase every day.""

Penske said the IU Health letter was ""disappointing"" but did not force his hand. Instead, it simply came down to metrics of how the coronavirus is spreading through Indiana.

""The number of cases in Marion County has tripled while the positivity rate has doubled. We said from the beginning of the pandemic we would put the health and safety of our community first, and while hosting spectators at a limited capacity with our robust plan in place was appropriate in late June, it is not the right path forward based on the current environment,"" the speedway said in a statement.

The first inkling that Penske's group was waffling came Monday when the speedway confirmed to the AP that the opening day of practice scheduled for next Tuesday had been scrapped. The first day of practice will now be Aug. 12. The only other change to the schedule right now is the elimination of the Pit Crew Competition traditionally held on Carb Day, two days before the race.

The pandemic has obliterated the IndyCar schedule, with the series shutting down just two days before its March 15 scheduled season-opener. The schedule has undergone numerous alterations since, with a West Coast swing to Portland and Laguna Seca cancelled last week and doubleheaders added to Mid-Ohio, Gateway in St. Louis and the road course at Indianapolis.

Then, days after announcing the latest schedule updates, the Mid-Ohio events scheduled for this coming weekend were postponed. IndyCar has run just six events since the season resumed June 6. Limited spectators have been allowed at doubleheaders at Road America in Wisconsin and at Iowa Speedway, where Penske had to be the race promoter for the event to be held.

Penske, just the fourth owner of national landmark IMS, has spent roughly $15 million on renovations to the historic property that he eagerly awaited showcasing for fans. His doubleheader weekend with IndyCar and NASCAR in July was held without fans and access to the property was limited to the competitors inside the facility.

He said ""the place looks even 50% per cent better than it did in July"" and takes solace that the IndyCar paddock will be able to get a closer look at the upgrades when the track opens next week. As for fans?

""Look, this is a long-term investment for us for many generations to come,"" he said. ""We will continue to improve the speedway, the competitors will get to see it over the next two weeks and we believe this decision now regarding the 500 is in the best interest of protecting the 500 for the future."""

In 1928, Chrysler purchased Dodge Brothers Co. and continued the momentum by introducing both the low-priced Plymouth, an evolution of the four-cylinder Chrysler 52, and the mid-market De Soto.

article continues below

De Soto’s creation came about almost accidentally. In 1928, Walter Chrysler’s initial attempt to buy Dodge Brothers was refused by the banks that controlled it, so he created the medium-priced De Soto.

Then, when the bankers changed their minds and agreed to sell Dodge to Chrysler, the De Soto was already on the assembly line.

The 1929 De Soto was introduced in August 1928 to an enthusiastic acceptance. Within a year, 81,065 were sold, a first-year model sales record that stood for more than 30 years.

Named for Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto, discoverer of the Mississippi River, De Soto was intended to convey a spirit of “travel, pioneering and adventure.” Usually it didn’t, although for a period in the 1950s it did build the hot0performing Adventurer.

The Depression reduced De Soto’s 1930 sales to 34,889 in spite of a straight-eight engine joining the six. The eight was discontinued in 1932, although De Soto added free-wheeling that allowed coasting without compression braking. It also got the soft “Floating Power” engine mounts pioneered by Plymouth in 1931.

For 1933, De Soto was moved to a higher price range closer to Chrysler and away from Dodge. When De Soto and Chrysler introduced their controversial streamlined Airflow models in 1934, De Soto went totally to the Airflow but Chrysler wisely hedged by also continuing the conventional “Airstream.”

Airflows were well-engineered cars, but their radical style did not sell well, so De Soto revived its conventional Airstream model in 1935, but also kept the Airflow until 1936.

De Soto’s fortunes gradually improved through the 1930s, given a considerable boost when they proved to be very good taxis. Many New York City De Soto cabs covered more than a million miles during the Second World War car shortage.

With the Airflow discontinued in 1936, all De Sotos had conventional styling for 1937. The peak of its 1940s elegance was reached in 1942 just before production ceased for the war. The ’42 was liberally decorated with chrome, a bold vertical bar grille and “Airfoil” headlights concealed under metal covers.

After the war, De Soto returned to production early in1946 with their 1942 design with some changes to fenders, doors and bumpers. The hidden headlamps were gone.

Chrysler Corp. introduced its all-new styling in 1949 and many thought they took a wrong turn with taller, more conservative cars than the competition.

In 1951, Chrysler Corp. scored a coup with its sensational new hemispherical combustion chamber overhead valve Firepower V-8. Soon nicknamed the Hemi, Chrysler’s developed 180 horsepower from 5.4 litres (331 cu in.), the most powerful engine in the American industry. De Soto got its smaller 4.5-litre (276 cu in.), 160 horsepower Firedome Hemi midway through the 1952 model year, its first eight since 1932.

Chrysler Corp. finally abandoned the stodgy styling with its 1955 Forward Look. Vestigial fins made their appearance, grew higher for 1956 and really went wild the following year.

Chrysler seemed determined to match General Motors with chrome and fins in what would be called the Decade of Decadence. The term “rolling jukeboxes” was not without justification.

In the face of a squeeze on mid-priced cars caused by low-priced cars growing larger, De Soto lost market share through the 1950s. Also, it always seemed to suffer in Chrysler’s shadow; even the high- performance Adventurer series beginning in 1956 didn’t turn the tide.

But the corporation continued trying, launching a full line of 22 De Soto models in four series for 1959. Alas, the resuscitation attempt was a losing cause.

For the restyled 1960 models, now with unit construction, only the Fireflite and Adventurer series were offered. The Adventurer lost its performance-car fangs when horsepower dropped from 350 to 305.

New De Soto models were introduced for 1961, but the writing was clearly on the wall.

Production ceased in November 1960 after only about 3,000 1961s had been built. They were not marketed in Canada.

De Sotos were almost always known as solid if unspectacular cars that provided good value for money for conservative buyers. Except for the short-lived “real” 1950s Adventurer models, they didn’t have a strong performance reputation.

During De Soto’s 30-plus years, just over two million were built. The year in which it died, 1960, was the year its first year sales record was broken.

Reflecting the changing times, the car that did it was the new compact Ford Falcon."

The term “dooring” has become legendary among cyclists and drivers alike. The fine itself was always thought by many to be far too low, considering the potential damage to relatively innocent cyclists.

article continues below

The fine has been raised to $368, as of Sept. 21 this year. This is good news. Finally, after decades of associated groups lobbying, there has been a politician who not only listened, but also acted.

The injuries sustained by a cyclist crashing into an open motor vehicle door can be fatal, but are more often serious than minor. Damage to the bike is of much less importance than to the rider.

David Eby, in his role as attorney-general and minister responsible for ICBC, made the announcement about a week ago. This increased fine, coupled with the same penalty point assessment, may be a wake-up call for all drivers.

Using the Dutch Reach, when the right arm is used to open the driver's door, will give all drivers a better angle to spot cyclists approaching from the left side blind spot.

This regulation, and associated fine, is a complete anomaly, as compared to the rest of the Motor Vehicle Act. It is the only time, except for the own lane head-on crash, that a driver can smash into another vehicle and remain blameless. That is right, blameless! Because traffic of all types is at the mercy of person opening the vehicle door, it has been deemed the responsibility of the driver, or any passenger, to look for hazards before opening the vehicle door.

Many drivers are surprised to learn they are 100 per cent at fault, when this type of crash occurs. Furthermore, passengers may also be held liable, if they open a vehicle door and a crash takes place.

It is best to allow passengers to exit the vehicle at the sidewalk location immediately beside the vehicle. This works well, even in a one-way street configuration. Children and unlicensed riders should never exit into traffic. They are often oblivious to the danger of all types of lateral movement.

Now that the minister responsible has taken definitive action against “dooring,” it may be time to take a good look at the paltry fine of $30 for not wearing a bike helmet. Police are reluctant to get out of their vehicles to enforce such an offence, particularly when there are other higher priorities.

Given that the above-mentioned fine of “dooring” has increased about four-fold, it is probably time to do the same with the fine for a helmet violation for cyclists. A sum of $120 would be more like it. Who could argue with it? Or perhaps the fine for a cyclist without a helmet should be about the same as a driver or passenger without a seatbelt.

It is good to see so many cyclists pedalling back and forth. It means fewer motor vehicles on our roads, a healthier population and an environmental advantage.

How long will it be before the cycle crowd becomes the cash cow for government, in the same way motor vehicles have funded all sorts of endeavours?

There are other unanswered questions.

Will there be a special tax on electric vehicles, given they have caused a loss of gas tax revenue?

Will motorized cycles or standard cycles be taxed at the same rate as traditional motorcycles?

Will there be a universal road tax for all users, regardless of the mode of travel?

Will certain cyclists be required to insure, test and register?

The future may well be financial, as opposed to friendly.

Hydro says the number of electric-vehicle drivers using EV charging stations has rebounded to near pre-pandemic levels.

In February, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit B.C., there were more than 21,000 charging sessions at B.C. Hydro’s 70 stations across the province.

However, the company says the number dropped by nearly 20 per cent after residents began to work from home, and were down 30 per cent by April to 12,700.

Since then, charging sessions have increased by almost 50 per cent since the lowest point in April, according to a B.C. Hydro report Friday, and there were 20,000 charging sessions in the month of June.

B.C. Hydro says the most popular charging location is at the Superstore on Grandview Highway in Vancouver, likely due to its proximity to Highway 1.

Other popular charging stations near major roads or highways include Colwood Park on Vancouver Island, Britton Creek Rest Area in the Fraser Valley and Tournament Capital Centre in Kamloops.

The company says the frequency of charging at its highway stations indicates more people are commuting or taking road trips in an EV.

B.C. Hydro is encouraging EV drivers to charge at home as much as possible during the pandemic, but says it recognizes many customers rely on public charging infrastructure.

Staff are asking EV drivers to prastice social distancing at stations and bring sanitizing wipes or gloves to minimize potential transfer of COVID-19."

Crosley, Jr. of Cincinnati, Ohio, became so appalled at the high prices charged for radios he vowed to do something about it. In co-operation with some University of Cincinnati engineering students, he developed a low-priced radio, and established a plant to manufacture it. His timing was perfect; widespread broadcasting was just beginning.

By the early 1920s, Crosley Radio Corp. was the world's largest radio maker with its own station WLW in Cincinnati. Crosley expanded into appliances and his Shelvador refrigerator pioneered shelves in doors. Avid baseball fan Crosley bought the Cincinnati Reds who played in Crosley Field.

In the 1930s, Crosley revived a dream of producing a light, economical car.

He had his engineers design a tiny two-door, four-passenger model 3,048 millimetres (120 inch) long with a 2,032 mm (80 in.) wheelbase. It weighed only 420 kilogram (925 pound) and had a two-cylinder 0.6 litre (39 cu in.) air-cooled, 15 horsepower Waukesha engine. Things like tube-and-fabric seats, hand-operated wipers, sliding windows and no flexible engine mounts kept the price at $250.

The Crosley was introduced in the spring of 1939 and marketed through Crosley dealerships and appliance stores. By year’s end, more than 2,000 were sold.

Mechanical problems reduced 1940 sales to 422, so Crosley’s new chief engineer, Paul Klotsch, added engine mounts and other improvements for better durability.

Sales revived, and when the Second World War ended, car production in 1942, 3,300 Crosleys had been produced.

Crosley’s war projects included building small, sheet metal, inline four-cylinder engines for navy generating sets. Crosley obtained patent rights to the engine.

When peace came in 1945 Crosley sold controlling interest in the radio/appliance business to concentrate on Cincinnati-based Crosley Motors Inc. and its Marion, Indiana, plant.

The heart of Crosley’s postwar cars was the new engine made of sheet metal stampings and thin-walled steel cylinder tubes brazed together with copper in a furnace. Called the COBRA engine, for COpper BRAzed, it was designed by California sheet metal engine specialist Lloyd Taylor and weighed a feathery 26.8 kg without starter or generator.

With single overhead camshaft and oversquare bore and stroke of 63.5 by 57.1 mm (2.50 by 2.25 in.) it displaced 725 cc (44 cu in.) and developed 26.5 horsepower at a high 5,000 rpm. Its five-bearing crankshaft rotated in an aluminum crankcase.

Crosley kept the previous 2,032 mm (80 in.) wheelbase but increased length to 3,683 mm (145 in.) and weight to 522 kg (1,150 lb).

Production began in mid-1946 and by year's end a car-starved market absorbed 4,987 two-door sedans and some convertibles and pickups. Sales increased to almost 20,000 in 1947 and over 31,000 in 1948, including some 23,000 station wagons, the world’s largest wagon producer. It was Crosley’s best year.

Serious problems surfaced when electrolysis corroded holes in the engine, causing coolant to leak out or enter the crankcase with disastrous results. Klotsch designed a new sturdier and quieter CIBA (Cast Iron Block Assembly) block with cylinder head integral with the block, not removable. Although retrofitted to many cars, Crosley’s reputation was tarnished.

Crosley offered more contemporary styling in 1949, and also introduced Hydradisc four-wheel disc brakes, the first production car with four-wheel, calliper-type discs. After some problems Crosley returned to drums in mid-1950.

Crosley pioneered his 1949 Hotshot sports car which in spite of its tiny engine provided surprising performance. Mechanix Illustrated's Tom McCahill reported zero to 97 km/h (60 mph) in 28.1 seconds and top speed of 119 km/h (74 mph) for the 499 kg (1100 lb) roadster.

The successor Super Sport with 10.0:1 compression ratio reduced zero to 97 (60) to 19.7 seconds and raised top speed of 124 km/h (77 mph).

McCahill was more impressed with Crosley’s engine than with the rest of the car, calling their $1,000 sports car a “tin tub on wheels with a fine engine.”

Crosley “won” the first Sebring, Florida, race in 1950 on an Index of Performance formula calculation, not speed. A Crosley special also ran well in the 1951 LeMans, France, 24-hour race until its French generator failed.

In 1950, Crosley introduced its small, versatile, Jeep-type, dual purpose Farm-O-Road for road and light agricultural use. It had a 1,600 mm (63 in.) wheelbase, six forward speeds and two reverse. Options included dump or pickup boxes and dual wheels.

Engine problems and a changing market reduced Crosley sales to just over 7,400 sales in 1949 and 6,800 in 1950. Although the end was near, Crosley’s 1951 sales held at 6,600. This was below breakeven and Powel Crosley’s automotive dream ended in 1952 after producing just over 2,000 1952 models.

Powel Crosley Jr. died in 1961 at the age of 74, his success with radios and appliances having failed to transfer to cars."

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

article continues below

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister.
""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.
""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.
MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.","OTTAWA — Chrystia Freeland shattered a glass ceiling Tuesday, becoming the first woman to be sworn in as Canada's finance minister.

The gravitas of the moment was not lost on the former journalist and mother of three. After she spoke the English words of her oath of office, she paused to take a deep breath, before repeating the oath in French.

article continues below

""It's about time,"" Freeland said later at a press conference on Parliament Hill.

She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.

Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.

But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.

""There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,"" said Turnbull. ""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.""

Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.

She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.

""We don't like their representative very much,"" he said of her in September 2018.

Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said ""Mama (does not equal) chopped liver."" On the back it said ""Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.""

When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.

And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.

""She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,"" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.

He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.

""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.

""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.

""I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,"" he said. ""And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.""

She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.

""What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,"" Kelly said on Twitter. ""This has been missing in the department for several years.""

MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.

While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.

Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.

Trudeau said Tuesday that she had been ""a key player in my government from day one.""

The Nisga'a Lisims government said Tuesday that Gosnell died in his home in New Aiyansh after a long battle with cancer.

article continues below

Gosnell was a hereditary Nisga'a chieftain of the Eagle Clan and was president of the nation when it finalized a landmark treaty in 2000 that gave the First Nation control over its land including forestry and fishing rights. It was the first modern-day treaty signed in B.C. since the 1800s.

Nisga'a Nation president Eva Clayton said Gosnell's wisdom, dignity and determination helped lead the First Nation into self-government over its territory northeast of Prince Rupert.

""Today, we have lost a giant,"" Clayton said in a statement. ""His legacy will help shape the project of reconciliation for generations to come.""

Gosnell was a recipient of the Order of Canada, the Order of B.C. and held an honorary doctorate of laws from Royal Roads University in Victoria.

He is survived by his wife of 64 years, Audrey, their seven children and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Gosnell grew up in the Nass River Valley in B.C.'s northwest. He worked as a commercial fisherman, carpenter and traditional carver before he was elected as a band councillor and chief of the Gitlaxt'aamiks Band, one of the Nisga'a village governments.

Gosnell was appointed chancellor of the University of Northern B.C. last year and served until his death.

University interim president Geoffrey Payne said Gosnell's dedication to education was evident during his time as chancellor.

""The world has lost a tremendous leader, a man who repeatedly demonstrated a love for his community, his people, education and a commitment to enhancing the lives of others,"" Payne said in a statement.

Clayton said Gosnell's work to negotiate the Nisga'a Treaty produced a ""beacon of hope"" for people around the world.

""His focus was always on what the Nisga'a, British Columbians and Canadians can achieve together,"" she said.

When a bill to accept the treaty was introduced in the legislature in December 1998, Gosnell told the house the agreement proved to the world that reasonable people can sit down and settle historical wrongs.

""It's a triumph because under the treaty, we will no longer be wards of the state, no longer beggars in our own land. It's a triumph because under the treaty, we will collectively own approximately 2,000 square kilometres of land, far exceeding the postage-stamp reserve set aside for us by colonial governments.""

He said the treaty proved that negotiations — not lawsuits, blockades or violence — are the most effective and honourable way to resolve Aboriginal issues.

""It's a triumph, I believe, that signals the end of the Indian Act, the end of more than a century of humiliation, degradation and despair for the Nisga'a Nation.""

Premier John Horgan said in a tweet that everyone can learn from Gosnell's legacy of working to make life better for people and he'll be missed.

""He was instrumental in helping the Nisga'a chart a new path of self-governance through BC's first modern treaty.""

The nation said funeral arrangements will be announced by the family.

The BC Wildfire Service said crews are responding to the fire on Christie Mountain about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, on the east side of Skaha Lake.

The fire is estimated at 250 hectares and firefighters on the ground are being supported by air tankers.

The service said the situation was ""rapidly evolving"" and asked everyone to stay clear of the area to avoid interfering with the operation.

The order asks residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with pets and critical items.

""We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,"" the service said in a tweet.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a ""fire of note"" on Tuesday.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was smouldering with no open flame but was considered out of control. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight.

Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Firefighters have tackled dozens of wildfires after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions.

Two fires were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada has estimated returning sockeye would hit a record low this year, with about 283,000 fish or fewer making it from the ocean to their Fraser River spawning grounds.

Just last month, the department estimated 941,000 sockeye would return, though it noted salmon forecasts were highly uncertain, in part because of a lack of understanding of the effects of warming ocean waters.

The council, made up of the B.C. Assembly of First Nations, the First Nations Summit and Union of B.C. Indian chiefs, says Indigenous communities that rely on the salmon for food face the greatest impacts, but the department has consistently prioritized commercial fishing.

Representatives with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans were not immediately available for comment.

First Nations fishing rights are protected by the Constitution and the council says the federal government has failed in its duty to ensure they have priority access to salmon.

Robert Phillips with the First Nations Summit says Indigenous leaders have been calling on Ottawa to save the salmon for decades and it's time for full jurisdiction over salmon stocks to be transferred back to First Nations.

Five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations on Vancouver Island have also accused federal fisheries officials of systemic racism after the government decided to exclude them in the allocation of 15,000 extra salmon this year — a surplus that arose because fewer people were fishing recreationally during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Salmon returning to the Fraser River also face the added hurdle of making it over a massive landslide along a remote stretch of the river north of Lillooet.

A pneumatic pump and tube system and the construction of a fish ladder have been installed to help salmon over the five-metre waterfall created by the slide.

In an update last week, Fisheries and Oceans said water levels have dropped sufficiently in recent days to allow fish to pass over the slide on their own steam.

A Department of Fisheries document from 2017 says total adult returns of Fraser River sockeye are highly variable ranging from 2 to 28 million, with an average of 9.6 million, between 1980 and 2014.

In documents filed by her court-appointed lawyer that give a rare public airing to the wishes of the 38-year-old pop superstar, she asked that her father not return to the role of conservator of her person, which gave him power over her major life decisions from 2008 until 2019, when he temporarily stepped aside, citing health problems.

article continues below

""Britney is strongly opposed to James return as conservator of her person,"" the document says.

James Spears has kept his separate role as conservator over his daughter's finances. For the first 11 years of the conservatorship, he served as co-conservator with attorney Andrew M. Wallet, who resigned from the role early last year.

That briefly left James Spears with sole power over Britney Spears' life, money and career, a situation she says she very much wants to avoid repeating.

An email seeking comment from James Spears' attorney was not immediately returned.

Spears says she wants Jodi Montgomery, who has been serving as conservator of her person temporarily, to do so permanently, but she says that doesn't mean she is waiving her right to seek an end to the entire arrangement.

The documents also reveal that Britney Spears has no plans to perform again anytime soon. She last performed live in October 2018, and early in 2019, cancelled a planned Las Vegas residency.

The filing gave a rare glimpse at Britney Spears' own wishes in the conservatorship that has had vast power over her for over a decade. She has almost never spoken publicly about the matter, and court hearings and documents in the case are cloaked in secrecy, though last year she addressed the court at her request, suggesting she was seeking changes.

In the papers, Britney Spears praises the conservatorship and its work overall, saying it ""rescued her from a collapse, exploitation by predatory individuals and financial ruin"" and that it made her ""able to regain her position as a world class entertainer.""

The document was filed a day before a status hearing on the conservatorship, expected to be closed to the media and public.

Britney Spears' attorney said that he expects James Spears will aggressively contest being marginalized, and said that Britney Spears has suggested they retain a lawyer with expertise in complex financial court fights.

The conservatorship, known in some states as a guardianship, gave James Spears power over his daughter's career choices and much of her personal life, including her relationship with her teenage sons. Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline has custody of the boys, but she has frequent visits with them.

When you are The Killers and your usual guitarist has gone, no problem. When you’re The Killers you can turn to Lindsey Buckingham.

article continues below

The former Fleetwood Mac guitarist steps in for a tune on the new 10-song ""Imploding the Mirage,"" another sign of the band’s clout. The album's guests also include k.d. lang and Adam Granduciel of The War on Drugs.

The absence of guitarist and co-founder Dave Keuning is felt, with keyboards and drums stepping into the void. Without Keuning’s jangle and riff shards, The Killers have a more poppy sound.

If 2017's ""Wonderful Wonderful"" was a meditation on the anxiety of masculinity, the new album often explores the lives of women, with two sharp portraits of tough survivors in ""Blowback"" and ""Caution"" — women whom Brandon Flowers sings each come from ""white trash.""

Many other songs are about loyally backing a partner. ""I’ll be there when water’s rising/I’ll be your lifeguard,"" Flowers sings on ""Dying Breed."" On ""When the Dreams Run Dry,"" he vows: ""I’ll be on your side/When the dreams run dry."" In ""Lightening Fields,"" he sings, ""Just wanted to run my fastest/And stand beside you."" The cover of the album depicts a god tenderly supporting a goddess.

Jonathan Rado of California psychedelic-rock duo Foxygen and Shawn Everett — who worked on ""Wonderful Wonderful"" as well as with Kacey Musgraves and Alabama Shakes — have stepped in to produce and their influence can best be heard on the funky ""Fire in Bone.""

Elsewhere, listeners may have fun finding the band's other influences. There's a Tom Petty-ish sound to ""Blowback"" and ""My Own Soul's Warning"" has a Springsteen vibe. But there's no mistaking that classic Killers mix of soaring vocals, sonic bombast and sly humour in such songs as ""My God"" and the title track. It's a solid album from a band still exploring.

""This is me. I am 'Pipe Nation,'"" she said with a laugh Monday during an interview with The Canadian Press in Sundre, Alta., a picturesque oil town nestled near the Rocky Mountains.

article continues below

""I've been working in the oil and gas industry for about six years. I took a break when the bust happened and did a little serving, a little bartending but always went back to the oil and gas,"" added Gamble, who is 24.

""My father, my grandfather and my great grandfather were all in the oil and gas industry as well.""

Sundre is set to become the fictional community of Hardwell. The drama will focus on day-to-day hardships labourers face, with Gamble's character as the leader of a pipe gang — workers who position and align the pipe, preparing it for the weld. In real life, Gamble has held a number of jobs in the industry including welding.

But this is her first acting part since middle school.

""I always wanted to become an actor because I always thought pretending to be someone and falling into a character is a lot of fun and being someone else,"" she said.

""Unfortunately that's not the direction I went to until now when I got handed this beautiful opportunity that my little-girl dream could come true.""

Filmmaker and director Raoul Bhatt says he wanted a mix of both professional and amateur actors on set, and he's not concerned about the lack of experience from some of his cast members. He sees it as an asset to the project.

""I needed this to be believable and I needed someone with a certain language, a certain grit, combined with people who have actor experience,"" said Bhatt, adding 480 people showed up for the casting call. ""I wanted someone who's believable, honest, sincere and lives in the moment.""

Bhatt, who grew up in Edmonton, has a soft spot for the energy sector and says the show is meant to spotlight the colourful nature of the individuals.

""They're just beautiful people and to showcase that beyond the Dow Jones, beyond just the oil and gas numbers to human struggle, conditions and overcoming adversity and the determination of these characters is what the show is about,"" he said.

Bhatt, a software engineer who self-funded the pilot, has worked as a cinematographer and producer for the Daytime Emmys, as well as with Universal Studios' ""Jurassic World"" and a number of music videos.

He understands there are plenty of people out there who are not fans of the oil and gas industry.

""We are leaning toward pro but again that's for the viewer to decide. If you're against the oil and gas industry that's your opinion but I really hope this creates an emotional connection with the characters.""

Filming of the pilot will be completed by the end of August. Bhatt said he is in negotiations with a couple of streaming services for a 10-episode season.

A storage lot for oilfield equipment in Sundre is one of the regular sets. In addition, a portion of farmland in Sundre has been cleared for the actual building of a mini pipeline to add to the realism of the show.

Bhatt isn't short on technical advisers. Gin Ford, who plays the character Dee, has been a pipeline welder for the past 10-plus years. She has no acting experience but intends to use the show as a vessel for female empowerment and women in the energy industry.

""I'm not here for fame or recognition. I am actually here to make a voice for women in trades. Here's the moment for me to be a voice,"" said Ford.

""I've been called the pipeline princess and it's like, you can roll onto site and right way it's 'this girl's out here to work?'"" she said.

""I definitely want to highlight you can look like you want and you can still work in a male-dominated industry. It doesn't matter if you've got the nails, the lashes, the hair or the Barbie image.""

Ford said the show is meant to be raw, but it's not reality TV or a documentary.

""I'm not going to lie. My mom's probably going to tell me to wash my mouth out with some soap,"" Ford said, noting her character is tough-talking, confident and keeps up with the guys.

Mike Vickers plays Ryan, an East Coaster who moved to Alberta to make his fortune in the oil industry. Art imitates life for Vickers who moved to Alberta from Cape Breton.

""When I read the script it was my life. I fell in love with this. It's going to really showcase that true oil and gas grit, the struggles we all face and how we overcome it together as a family,"" Vickers said.

""There's so much opportunity to better the image of this industry and it's how we all come together is how we're going to do this and tell this story.""

Filming in Sundre is expected to wrap up by Aug. 24 and will finish in Nisku, south of Edmonton, by the end of the month.

Michelaine Lahaie, chair of the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for RCMP, says a video shows an RCMP officer opening the door of a moving police vehicle, which hits the man.

The officer and other Mounties then use force to arrest him while he's on the ground.

Lahaie says the man was then injured in an alleged assault by another detained man in a cell at the Kinngait RCMP detachment and had to be flown to Iqaluit for medical treatment.

She says the investigation is to determine whether the conduct of the Mounties, including use of force, was reasonable.

She says in a news release that the probe will be a Public Interest Investigation into the conduct of RCMP in Kinngait.

""The RCMP members' conduct will be assessed in accordance with relevant law and RCMP policy,"" reads the terms of reference of the investigation released Tuesday.

""Consideration will also be given as to whether racial bias and/or discrimination played a role in the man's arrest and subsequent treatment.""

Lahaie noted the review she has requested by the commission is separate from an investigation by the Ottawa Police Service at the request of the Mounties and an RCMP internal Code of Conduct review.

""I am concerned with the conduct of RCMP members involved in this serious incident and will monitor both the OPS (Ottawa police) investigation and the RCMP's Code of Conduct investigation,"" Lahaie said in a release.

""The CRCC's investigation will provide an added level of scrutiny to the incident, as it will additionally examine the circumstances that led to the man being placed in a cell at the RCMP detachment where another detainee assaulted him and he needed to be airlifted to Iqaluit for treatment.

""I am aware that there is historical distrust by Inuit toward the police and I am committed to increasing RCMP accountability.""

The day after the man's arrest Nunavut Justice Minister Jeannie Ehaloak said she was outraged.

""I have seen the video from Kinngait circulating on social media and am very concerned by the unnecessary force, the violence and the lack of respect I have seen,'' she said in a release at the time.

""Nunavummiut should not fear this kind of treatment and disregard for safety and basic rights.''

Ehaloak said she would formally request a review by the commission.

The Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the Mounties was created to ensure that public complaints made about the conduct of RCMP members are examined fairly and impartially.

Here is what that means and what could come next.

Word — The term comes through Middle English and Old French from a Latin root, prorogare, to prolong.

article continues below

Effect — Prorogation essentially ends a session of Parliament, allowing for a new beginning with a speech from the throne.

Legislation — At one time, prorogation killed all legislation before Parliament, but rule changes now provide that most bills can be revived in the new session at the same stage they were at when the previous session ended.

Committees — Committees, including special and legislative committees, cease to exist. Membership on committees, except the membership of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, is terminated and all chairs and vice-chairs no longer hold these positions.

Documents — No document may be tabled until the first day of a new session.

Quote — ""Prorogation of a session brings to an end all proceedings before Parliament. With certain exceptions, unfinished business 'dies' on the Order Paper and must be started anew in a subsequent session."" — House of Commons Procedure and Practice, Third Edition, 2017.

Length — Prorogation can be as short as a few hours, or as long as several months. During this period, the House of Commons and Senate are shut down but the government remains in power and MPs remain MPs.

Frequency — Most Parliaments are prorogued at least once and often there are several prorogations and sessions in the life of a Parliament.

Authority — Prorogation is ordered by the Governor General on the advice of the prime minister. It is not covered by statute. Rather it is a personal legal power of the Governor General and by convention the prime minister has the right to provide advice. And by convention it's actually the prime minister's decision.

Granted — Prorogation is routinely granted. In December 2008, then-governor general Michaelle Jean took a few hours before granting prorogation, but that was a thorny case because opposition parties were threatening to defeat the government and install a coalition government shortly after an election.

Ceremony — At one time, prorogation was done in a formal ceremony in the Senate chamber, but that hasn't been used in decades. A simple proclamation signed by the Governor General does the trick today.

Liberal promise — In their 2015 election platform, the Liberals said Stephen Harper's Conservatives ""used prorogation to avoid difficult political circumstances. We will not.""

Limits — Governments can't use prorogation to shut down Parliament indefinitely. That would violate the constitutional requirement that Parliament meet at least once every 12 months. And without Parliament to approve a budget and spending estimates, the government would run out of money.

The conservation service made no effort to capture those bears after determining it was a defensive attack.

The five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations are upset that Ottawa decided to give a surplus allocation of salmon — which arose this year due to reduced recreational fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic — to commercial fishers rather than to the First Nations.

Clifford Atleo, lead negotiator for one of the nations who is also called Wickaninnish, says he feels sports and commercial troll fishers are given more rights to fish in the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

He says the latest decision to shut First Nations fishers out of an opportunity to catch more chinook salmon this year shows systemic racism is ""alive and well"" within the federal fisheries department.

""We feel very strongly we're not being dealt with fairly, we know we're not being dealt with fairly,"" Atleo said.

""It's just another layer of disappointment on the part of how the government deals with us. The government doesn't realize that their attitude toward our people is dyed-in-the-wool ... And I think the government — sometimes they don't realize they're being racist. They've got age-old policies that have never changed.""

A 2018 B.C. Supreme Court ruling directed Ottawa to take a more ""generous approach"" to allocations of chinook salmon to the First Nations given the importance of this species to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people.

The ruling from B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Humphries noted that the government's salmon allocation policy at the time gave recreational fisherman priority to fish for chinook and soho salmon ahead of the First Nations and advised the fisheries minister to reassess this policy.

Despite this ruling and changes that have since placed the First Nations at a higher priority than sport fishers, the Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ehattesaht and Mowachaht/Muchalaht nations say their yearly fishing allocations have not increased.

This year, the five First Nations were told they could fish 7,724 chinook, which amounts to just 1.5 fish per person for the 5,000 members of their communities.

COVID-19 brought a new dynamic to the salmon allocations this year, as fewer sport fishers were able to come due to pandemic restrictions. This means the recreational fleet is expected to catch 15,000 less salmon than was forecasted for this year, according to figures provided by the department.

None of this surplus is going to the First Nations.

""As per approved management plans, the Area G (commercial) harvest is adjusted based on the projected recreational harvests which results in an increase of 15,000 for 2020,"" said department spokesperson Athina Vazeos.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan was unavailable for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Jennifer Kuss, noted the improvements made in giving the five nations a higher priority in the yearly salmon catch allocations, as directed by the courts.

""This change ensures that food, social, and ceremonial (fishing) continues to be prioritized first, and additionally prioritizes the Five Nations rights-based sale fishery over the recreational and commercial fishery,"" Kuss said in a statement.

The Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations argue Ottawa could have provided some of the unused catch from this year to their people to help them support their remote communities. But Atleo said fisheries officials would not even engage in discussions about it.

""The government is trying to say they consult with us, they negotiate with us. They create their fishing plans, put it on the table and it's like take or leave it,"" Atleo said.

""All we want to do is be part of the economy, part of looking after ourselves without depending on government. We don't think that's a lot to ask.""

NDP MP Gord Johns, whose riding takes in the West Coast fishing shores, said he finds it ""disgusting"" the Trudeau government has repeatedly highlighted its desire to restore the Crown's relationship with Indigenous Peoples but has still fought many legal battles with these nations over their fishing rights.

""Indigenous people in our communities rely on this fishery for their economy, for their food security, for their culture. It's part of their way of life. These are salt water people and they rely on the salmon and to be denied their right is shameful, it's disgusting that the government is taking this approach.""

The First Nations are calling on Ottawa to revisit its decision on the surplus salmon for this year to allow them a portion of the additional catch.

""The government has an opportunity to fix this with these (surplus salmon) to come with a fair opportunity to exercise their commitment, in the judge's words, for a generous allocation to the nations and to start moving forward with reconciliation,"" Johns said.

The minister's spokeswoman says Jordan takes any allegations of systemic racism ""very seriously"" and that Ottawa is working with the five nations on a reconciliation agreement on fisheries resources, which is intended to broaden their access in the area, Kuss said.

""The road to reconciliation is a long journey, and Canada is committed to moving forward together. The department has spoken with the five nations on the reallocation of (salmon catch) on multiple occasions and that open dialogue will continue.""

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

""It was nice to get on the board tonight,"" said O'Reilly.

""I haven't been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it's just one game. I've got to be consistent with it.""

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

""When we take care of the puck it's effective and it's hard on them,"" said O'Reilly.

""I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We've got to stick to our structure.""

Pietrangelo said they've been working on fixing the penalty kill.

""We've been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,"" he said.

""Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.""

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

""They're blocking a lot of shots, they're studying us. They kind of know what we're doing,"" said Miller.

He said they'll make adjustments but aren't going to go back to square one.

""We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,"" he said.

""It's not like we're getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They're a good team. We're a good team. It's going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.""

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O'Reilly, last year's Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play — the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O'Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O'Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler's stick and in.

O'Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

All Western Conference games are being played in front of no fans at Rogers Place. The players are being kept isolated in a so-called bubble between games to prevent contracting COVID-19.

It was the spring of 2010 and Clune, who had made his NHL debut earlier that season, was finally on the road to getting the help the 23-year-old knew he needed in his crippling addiction battle.

article continues below

With his younger brother, Matt, at the wheel, they drove through upstate New York in a torrential downpour home to Toronto. Clune wasn't sure he was going to make it.

""I was in the acute withdrawal phase,"" he said in a recent interview with The Canadian Press. ""I couldn't sit still for a second. The most logical thing at that point in time for me was to go jump off a bridge ... literally.

""I couldn't really see myself coming out of it.""

But come out of it he did, and a decade later, Clune is sharing his story in ""Hi, My Name is Dicky,"" a raw documentary available on iTunes and AppleTV that details his life from aspiring youth hockey player to out-of-control junior antagonist to pro athlete teetering on the edge — one consumed by drugs, alcohol and mental illness.

His journey to recovery started in earnest on that lonely stretch of highway.

""My brother really had to talk me off the ledge,"" Clune said. ""When I see his face and when I see my other brother Ben's face, that's what gave me strength to live, because I didn't really want to live for myself at that time.

""Matt, at a couple points on that drive, had to do things that no younger brother should have to do and really dig down deep and get me home.""

The documentary from Taylor Prestidge and Haris Usanovic of Upper Canada Films tracks Clune's life and career, recovery and redemption. It includes interviews with Clune's parents, brothers, teammates and coaches.

Clune was driven to be the best as a child, but the pressure led him down a dark path at early age.

""I made that decision I was going to put my head down and not see anything but being a hockey player,"" Clune, who was selected in the third round of the 2005 NHL draft by the Dallas Stars, says in the film.

He began to try alcohol in his early teens as a way to cope, and it escalated quickly once he got to high school and then the Ontario Hockey League.

""I had this hole inside me that made me insecure and afraid of the world,"" Clune recounts. ""I got wasted and was like, 'Wow. OK. I'll be able to do this. I can cope with this. It's like a warm blanket.'

""Alcohol saved me. It was my solution to that problem of being self-absorbed and focused on all the things that made me insecure and self-conscious and in pain and sad.""

But he didn't realize how much of a spiral his life was taking. In junior, he would drive from bar to bar, party to party, drinking, smoking marjiuana and doing cocaine.

""I wanted to walk that line of looking death in the face every day, but still play hockey and do all these things,"" Clune says in the film. ""I don't know how I did it.""

Things got worse after junior when he was living in the United States by himself before making his NHL debut in that fateful 2009-10 season, months before becoming completely unglued.

""I had achieved my goal,"" he recalls on screen. ""But I hated myself.""

Clune eventually checked into rehab a second time — he went once before, but didn't stay — and committed to getting better with a lot of help from the people around him.

After he got out, he resumed his career and went onto play a total of 120 regular-season games in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Nashville Predators. His contract was bought out in 2015, and he was again at a crossroads — retire or keep going.

That's when the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were in the early stages of their massive rebuild, came calling to see if Clune wanted to be part of their program. They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club. At the very least, he would play in the minors and help foster a new culture.

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, who was in charge of the minor-league Marlies at the time, saw something in Clune that could be useful.

""He provides a certain energy,"" Dubas said. ""He provides experience in his life that I thought brought a great spirit to our team.""

Clune played 19 games with Leafs, but the forward truly made his mark with the Marlies. He helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018 and plans to continue his on-ice career, but equally important was how he's helped mentor a number of current NHLers.

He's proud of where he is, and not shy talking about how he got there. Clune still goes to meetings, does the 12 steps and now works to help others.

He also thinks a lot about why he made the decision to live, to fight, and get better, when many others — including some fellow pro hockey players — have gone down a different path.

""In the beginning, it was because I wanted to see my brothers,"" said Clune, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Then it transformed into wanting to live for myself. I started to discover what it feels like to have self esteem and to have love.

""I just hope people realize that they're not alone with how they feel. Don't be afraid to ask for help.""

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

article continues below

""After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,"" Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal's three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first overall by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

""A low-maintenance superstar,"" said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg's senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At five foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn't blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack of getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday. ""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League. I think it was Dale's arrival that really cemented the future of the franchise and I think we all have recollections of that first year, that Calder (Trophy) year and then everything that would follow.

""He was truly a superstar as a hockey player, but I think why he was so loved here was not just that but largely the fact that he made this his home and became one of us. I think everybody shared that sense of pride in Dale's career as a player.""

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: ""All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL's all time greatest players.""

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

""What an incredible human being,"" Selanne tweeted.

Montreal Canadiens associate coach Kirk Muller also had a chance to speak with Hawerchuk in recent days.

""I talked to Dale a few days ago, and we had a good chance to chat. A good friend, had a real good opportunity to play against one of the all-time best players. As a hockey player, we all know how great he was, but he was a good friend and just a really special person, did a lot for charities. It's a real loss for us in the hockey world.""

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk ""one of the most decorated players in our game's history.""

In September 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

""For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I'm ready to fight it,"" he told TSN in October 2019. ""I want to live to tell the story.""

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie's bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames players Andrew Mangiapane and Rasmus Andersson remembered playing for Hawerchuk in Barrie.

""I don't know where I'd be without him,"" said Mangiapane. ""Very sad news today. I owe my career basically to him and the whole Barrie organization.""

Andersson, from Sweden, said ""Dale was a fantastic human being. Such a great person. My first week in Barrie he invited us over to his house and really just welcomed me to Canada. I cannot say enough good things about him as a person. Obviously a real good coach, too.""

""It's awful news.""

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday's opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at age two and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur's record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

""I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive — well maybe a little further now with the traffic,"" he said. ""I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""

""I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,"" he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and '81 with teammates that included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL's top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt like he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year — the youngest recipient at the time — and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

""Just one of the greatest. You could tell from day one. We knew from when he was 18 years old as a player that he would turn the (Jets) franchise around. Certainly one of the best I’ve ever played with and coached,"" said Dallas Stars coach Rick Bowness, who played with and coached Hawerchuk in the '80s.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

""He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,"" said Mike Doran, Winnipeg's director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the faceoff in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux's famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

""It turned out fantastic,"" said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada's call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets ""are etched in my mind every day that I live.""

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes' ring of honour.

Hawerchuk re-wrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia whom he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

""It's like going back down memory lane,"" he said in his induction speech.

""All the experiences have been fantastic,"" he added. ""I mean, sometimes they didn't feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing ... Even though I didn't win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn't change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.""

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets' Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November 2017.

""Tonight we fly Ducky's number high,"" said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue's ""Home Sweet Home,"" before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

""Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,"" said the PA announcer.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

""I've been to every part of (Manitoba), either golfing or playing (softball),"" Hawerchuk said. ""I've gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I'm honoured and I'm very humbled.""

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.

On Monday, the CFL cancelled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season.
The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign.
This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.","There'll be no football in 2020 but the CFL and CFL Players' Association still have plenty to discuss.

And that includes how to allow players under contract to CFL teams the ability to sign elsewhere — most notably the NFL — if the opportunity arises. On Monday, the CFL cancelled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The focus right now for us on a few certain things and one of them is ensuring if there's an ability for our players to receive some form of payment this year,"" Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA's executive director, said Monday during a conference call. ""They should be able to do that if they have an opportunity.""

While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season. However, 66 players have currently opted out of participating in the 2020 campaign, which could create opportunity for some CFL players to sign deals south of the border and have a chance to earn a football paycheque, either on the active roster or on the practice squad.

While there's no shortage of collegiate players available, the advantage a CFL player has is pro experience, a fact not lost upon NFL personnel people.

The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign. This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.

And players on NFL practice rosters receive at least US$8,000 per week.

Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the CFL is amendable to doing what it can to help its players.

""Where we can do something we will,"" he said. ""We're going to be committed to working towards good outcomes, the best possible outcomes we can have with out players.

""That's not going to mean we're going to be able to do everything but we're certainly going to go into this with a real positive spirit.""

Something else that will be on the CFL-CFLPA radar will be the current collective bargaining agreement, which is slated to expire after the 2021 season. But union president Solomon Elimimian said the two sides covered a lot of ground this time around during talks to amend the agreement for a shortened '20 season.

""Whether we deal with '21 when it comes or after the '21 season I think there's hope there that we can work together,"" Elimimian said. ""Obviously the relationship between the players and the league needs to be one where the players feel appreciated.

""Everyone wants to the league to reach its full potential. The partnership has to be one that's very genuine and the players have to feel part of that. If that happens, the sky is the limit.""

Ryu (2-1) struck out three and walked none. The left-hander permitted only one runner past second base and yielded just one extra-base hit to a team that came in ranked second in the majors with a .467 slugging percentage.

Rather than vie for strikeouts, Ryu said he was focused more on getting the Orioles to hit the ball weakly.

""I was able to keep them off balance,"" he said through an interpreter.

Signed in December to an $80 million, four-year contract, Ryu got off to a shaky start with Toronto in July before showing the form he displayed as a star with the Dodgers. He's given up a total of two runs in his last three starts after allowing eight runs over nine innings in his first two outings.

""That was vintage Ryu,"" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. ""Ryu was outstanding. That's the reason we won the game.""

The two home runs were a factor, but mostly Ryu was the difference-maker.

""They didn’t give Ryu that big contract for nothing,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""You just never know what he’s going to throw. You don’t know what side of the plate he’s going to throw to. He’s really tough on right-handers because he can locate it in. You saw a lot of us get jammed.""

The Blue Jays took control with a four-run third against Alex Cobb (1-2). Three infield hits produced a run before Grichuk delivered a three-run drive over the centre-field wall. It was his third home run of the season, all in the last four games.

""Obviously, the pitch to Grichuk was middle middle and it was a poorly executed pitch,"" Cobb said. ""But most of the pitches that I had, I felt like I executed. I got the results.""

Cobb gave up five runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He’s winless in his last four starts.

After hitting 31 homers last year, Grichuk was batting fifth, sixth or seventh in the order this season before Montoyo decided to move him into the No. 2 spot Sunday to replace injured Bo Bichette. Over the past two games, Grichuk has two homers, four hits and six RBIs.

Pedro Severino and Renato Núñez had RBIs for the Orioles, who have dropped two straight after winning seven of eight.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Bichette (right knee sprain) had an MRI and will receive a second opinion on his injury, Montoyo said. Bichette leads Toronto with a .361 batting average.

Orioles: RH Dillon Tate (elbow contusion) came off the injured list and RH Evan Phillips was optioned to the team's alternate site.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: RH Nate Pearson (0-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his fourth start in his first big league season Tuesday night. Drafted 28th overall in 2017, the 23-year-old is looking to rebound after giving up four runs to Miami last week in 2 1/3 innings. ""I'm developing at the highest level,"" Pearson said Monday. ""When I don't have my best stuff, I'm going to struggle.""

Orioles: LH Wade LeBlanc (1-0, 7.13) has allowed a combined 10 runs over 12 innings in his last three starts.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

""We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,"" Marchand said. ""That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.""

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

""We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do — little battles,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.""

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President's Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk's first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy's hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina's captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy putaway from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston's first six post-season games.

""There's other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.""

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen's late goal.

""That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,"" Williams said. ""We got it handed to us.""

NOTES: David Pastrnak had a goal and an assist in Boston’s double-overtime win in Game 1, but hasn’t played since. He had 48 regular-season goals to tie Washington’s Alex Ovechkin for the league lead. … Carolina played without 20-year-old Andrei Svechnikov, who was injured when his leg twisted awkwardly beneath him late in the third period of Saturday's loss. ... DeBrusk scored his 12th and 13th playoff goals since his 2018 post-season debut. … The Hurricanes were also without D Joel Edmundson for the third straight game. … Jake Gardiner assisted on Williams’ first-period goal for his first post-season point with Carolina.

The relaunch on Nov. 8 will allow all members to book seats on any Air Canada flight using Aeroplan points, a change from the current model where seat inventory is limited.

It will eliminate the carrier surcharge — which varies from less than $25 to the high hundreds — on flights purchased with points, though a $39 fee applies for trips operated by Air Canada's partner airlines.

Members will also be able to share points with up to eight friends and family members, combining them in a pool anyone in the group may put toward a trip.

The airline hopes the relaunch, planned after it reacquired the rewards program from Aimia Inc. in January 2019, will add another two million members before 2024 to the five million-plus who already hold Aeroplan cards.

The new program, based in part on feedback from thousands of consumers, ""is more important than ever as airlines compete to earn and retain customer loyalty in a rapidly changing environment,"" CEO Calin Rovinescu said in a statement Tuesday.

Passenger revenues at the Montreal-based airline dropped by 95 per cent year over year in its second quarter, prompting 20,000 layoffs as the airline burned through $19 million of cash per day amid border closures and a collapse in demand stemming from the coronavirus.

Air Canada made last-minute tweaks to the rewards revamp in response to the outbreak, prioritizing partnerships with the Uber Eats app and other companies yet to be announced, said Mark Nasr, head of loyalty and e-commerce at the company.

""We did a lot of soul-searching as COVID-19 developed,"" Nasr said. ""We really accelerated these 'every day' partnerships.""

The points that members earn on purchases via eligible retail, hotel and credit card partners will count toward to the tally required to reach the lowest rung of ""elite status"" — 25,000 kilometres of air travel in a year.

For example, an Uber Eats purchase of $50 would yield 100 points for Aeroplan members, and another 50 to 75 points if it was made through a TD Aeroplan Visa card.

Frequent travellers in one of Aeroplan's five elite categories will be able to share benefits such as lounge access and priority boarding with friends and family, even if they are not flying together.

Current Aeroplan members will keep their account numbers and Aeroplan miles will be converted to points on a one-for-one basis, Air Canada said.

The new system will base the number of points earned for a given flight on airfare rather than distance, which currently provides the baseline. That means the points gap between a flight to Asia and a flight across the country will likely narrow, since the difference in distance is often greater than the difference in price.

Meanwhile the new, more flexible pricing model — Air Canada has posted a ""points predictor"" tool on its website — also means more popular routes and times will cost more points than under the current fixed system, while off-peak times and less popular routes will be cheaper, said National Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen.

""We see this as margin-enhancing for Air Canada as it will be able to effectively charge market prices for rewards seats for more popular flights. In addition, it will allow the airline to enhance load factors on less popular flights,"" Doerksen said in a research note.

A flight between Toronto and Vancouver will cost between 25,000 and 35,000 points, according to the points predictor.

The renewed focus on consumer spending — TD announced Tuesday a ""refreshed suite"" of Aeroplan Visa credit cards, set to launch Nov. 8 — expands the loyalty program's potential appeal well beyond the jet set.

""The cards are what drives massive amounts of value. If Bob or Betty don't travel much by air, they can still have a TD or a CIBC or Amex credit card and they can make points on the program,"" said Robert Kokonis, president of Toronto-based consulting firm AirTrav Inc.

""There's all that day-to-day household spending that you can put onto the card that really generates points for the member and through to the bottom line of Aeroplan and then Air Canada.""

The added incentive to plastic comes as a welcome change for Air Canada credit card partners Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Visa and American Express.

Air Canada has said credit card penetration for so-called elite flyers is only 38 per cent versus about 50 per cent for most U.S. airlines.

TD and CIBC paid a total of $1.2 billion to help offset the hefty points liability, acquisition price and other working capital and pension assumptions for Air Canada.

Rick Steves (ricksteves.com) writes European travel guidebooks and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio.","A we have had to postpone our travels because of the pandemic, I believe a weekly dose of travel dreaming can be good medicine. Here’s a reminder of the fun that awaits us in Europe at the other end of this crisis.

Most travellers to southern France’s Provence region will visit Arles and Avignon, but ignore nearby Nîmes. While those two towns have name recognition and greater touristic appeal, Nîmes feels richer and more authentic. A visit to this thriving town rewards you with impressive Roman monuments and peaceful, pedestrian-polished streets that feel like a secret between its well-heeled residents.

article continues below

Born a Celtic city about 500 BC, Nîmes joined the Roman Empire in the first century BC Emperor Augustus made it a regional capital whose importance merited fine architecture, one of the longest protective walls in the Roman world, and a nearly 50-kilometre-long aqueduct to bring water to its growing population.

The core of Roman Nîmes was a temple called Maison Carrée (“Square House,” named before they had a word for rectangle). The temple rivals Rome’s Pantheon as the most complete and splendid building that survives from the Roman Empire. Maison Carrée survived in part because it has been in constant use for the past thousand years — from a temple to a church, to a city hall, to a people’s art gallery after the Revolution, and finally, as the monument travellers see today.

Nîmes also had an impressive amphitheatre for entertaining residents. Today, this arena — one of the best-preserved of the Roman world — is a superb example of Roman engineering, with its perfectly symmetrical oval shape, seating for 24,000 spectators, 60 passageways to prevent bottlenecks, a system of underground rooms and a lift used to hoist animals up to the floor for gladiator games. Touring the place provides an interesting history lesson, and climbing to the top offers the rare opportunity to enjoy city views from the nosebleed seats of a Roman arena.

Facing the arena is the Roman World Museum (Musée de la Romanité), with its high-tech interactive stations that help show off 5,000 artifacts from Roman Nîmes (plus a few from pre-Roman and medieval times). A highlight is its rich collection of Latin-inscribed stones and mosaics — some of which were discovered when digging the garage for the site.

As one of ancient Europe’s privileged cities, Nîmes needed a reliable water supply. So in about 19 BC, the Romans built a 50-kilometre-long aqueduct. While most of the aqueduct is on or below ground, one stretch is especially impressive: the Pont du Gard. About 30 minutes northeast of Nîmes, this bridge stretches over the Gardon River and is one of the most remarkable surviving Roman ruins anywhere.

Throughout the ancient world, aqueducts heralded the greatness of Rome. Even after many visits here, I’m forever impressed by the skill of ancient Roman engineers. This structure, built with perfectly cut stones fitted together without mortar, was designed to slope ever so slightly — less than an inch every hundred yards — to let water flow effortlessly into Nîmes.

There are many ways to enjoy the Pont du Gard. Visitors can hike to viewpoints, join a guided walking tour through the top channel of the aqueduct, and see its fine museum, where exhibits show the immensity of the undertaking. Summers are a great time to visit, as you can enjoy a picnic by the water, swim or canoe in the river and stay into the evening, when a light show is projected on the monument.

After seeing the Pont du Gard, it’s especially interesting to visit the castellum of Nîmes, the distribution tank marking the end of the aqueduct. Examining the castellum’s water-distribution holes, you can appreciate them as evidence of Roman Nîmes’ social compassion. The lower channel served top-priority needs, providing water via stone and lead pipes to the public wells that graced neighbourhood squares. The higher holes — which got wet only when the supply was plentiful — routed water to the homes of the wealthy, to public baths, and to nonessential fountains.

While Nîmes is most notable for its Roman sights, the city offers other things to enjoy, such as the carefully preserved old centre and thriving market hall. Another fine activity is strolling the Jardin de la Fontaine, a lavish park filled with Baroque sculptures and an ornate network of canals and paths. Finished just 50 years after the construction of Versailles, the Jardin de la Fontaine has special significance to the French, as these were the first grand gardens not meant for a king, but for the public.

Perhaps the most appealing part of Nîmes is its mellowness. It’s a great place to slow down and enjoy the inviting café scene, wander the traffic-free lanes, and savour a tranquil, less-touristed slice of southern France.

Parks Canada says the island will be open for guided tours for the next five weekends. A tour boat will leave the Cable Wharf every 40 minutes until the last run from the island at 5:10 p.m.

The island was fortified by the British military in 1750 and served as a detention centre during the deportation of Nova Scotia's Acadian population between 1755 and 1763.

Its military installations include Fort Charlotte, which is known for housing two seaward-facing artillery batteries and a spooky underground tunnel complex. The lower battery on the south side of the island includes several massive canons from the 1860s.

Georges Island is also the site of one of Canada's first fully automated lighthouses.

""For generations, Georges Island ... has remained out of reach to Haligonians and visitors alike,"" Fillmore said. ""Access to this emerald gem in Halifax Harbour will immerse visitors in the diverse history and ecology of this iconic landmark, while enjoying Halifax from a whole new vantage point.""

In late 2019, the federal government spent more than $2 million to build a permanent wharf with floating docks. In the future, the floating docks will offer access to water taxis and recreational boats.

Upon arrival on the island, visitors can expect to walk up a gravel path to Fort Charlotte, where interpreters will present the island's history and provide short tunnel tours through the lower level rooms and halls of the lower battery.

Visitors will be required to wear non-medical masks or face coverings and to follow public health recommendations including physical distancing.

Tours can be booked online at visitgeorgesisland.com or by phone at one of the Ambassatours waterfront kiosk.

Concerns about the level of detail airlines provide have been greatest in B.C., where the provincial health officer has lamented a lack of movement from federal officials.

In a letter to Transport Minister Marc Garneau, the B.C. government noted the information the province has received from airlines is ""not necessarily complete and is sometimes unusable.""

B.C. Transport Minister Claire Trevena said the data often includes the names of travel agencies that booked flights, a frequent flyer number, or the person who booked the ticket but not necessarily the name and contact information of the person who actually flew on the plane.

She urged the government to ""ensure the data gathered is usable and traces back to the individual traveller directly,"" rather than simply listing flights with a positive COVID-19 case.

""We have come so far together as a country with much success to curb the spread of COVID-19,"" reads the letter. A copy was provided to The Canadian Press.

""As we restart our economy, however, we want to ensure all passengers and communities remain safe and that nobody is put at risk due to any oversight.""

Garneau and Trevena spoke on Wednesday afternoon, his spokeswoman said. Livia Belcea said in an email that Garneau committed to create a way for airlines to share passenger data to trace ""individuals who may have been exposed to COVID 19 while on a domestic flight.""

The Public Health Agency of Canada already requires airlines to provide information on travellers arriving on international flights, who are subject to strict quarantine rules, but it's domestic flights where issues have arisen.

The divide in talks between Ottawa and the airlines appears to fall along whether phone numbers or email addresses are enough, or if residential addresses, for instance, should also be part of any handover.

Mike McNaney, president of the National Airlines Council of Canada, said in a statement that flight information is provided when requested, ""per established procedures for communicable diseases"" and usually in less than 24 hours.

""Our members are fully committed to protecting public safety,"" the statement said.

Public health officials tried to trace contacts for every person early on in the pandemic, but those efforts slowed as people were ordered to stay home or quarantine, and as travel dropped.

Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said Tuesday there could be improvements to the data that airlines provide, noting flight manifests lack all sorts of details that make it difficult to reach people in certain seats.

Tam also said there hasn't been a confirmed case of in-flight transmission.

""Very few of our cases actually come from travellers at the moment,"" she said. ""But now that our case numbers have gone down, there's been more interest in why don't we follow some of these planes and see if there's been any contact at all that's been exposed or transmitted.""

The federal health agency she leads referred further questions to Transport Canada, which had previously referred questions to the health agency.

Air operators have to record the names of everyone on board an aircraft, but there is no federal requirement that they submit passenger manifests to Transport Canada, said Belcea.

NDP transport critic Niki Ashton said the federal government needs to take a harder line on carriers to provide the necessary information for contact tracing.

""Airlines should be making sure that accurate information is being shared as soon as possible and it shouldn't be up to them to pick and choose how they do it,"" she said. ""It should be the federal government mandating them.""

The Air Passenger Rights organization sought leave to appeal Monday a Federal Court of Appeal decision that dismissed the group's attempt for an injunction compelling the Canadian Transportation Agency to remove a post about refunds from its website temporarily while a broader case about the statement's validity is ongoing.

article continues below

The CTA said in March that airlines have the right to issue travel credits instead of a refund for cancelled trips in the ""current context,"" though the agency later clarified that the online statement was ""not a binding decision.""

Canadian airlines have generally offered credit valid for two years or more but avoided offering reimbursement to customers whose flights were called off because of the coronavirus crisis, with carriers citing the agency's stance in response to consumer complaints and analyst questions.

Air Passenger Rights founder Gabor Lukacs says the CTA's statements misled travellers about their right to a refund and contradict the quasi-judicial body's previous decisions.

""If people believe they have no right to a refund, they will just not pursue it,"" he said in an interview.

""This case is about whether a public body can mislead the public without facing some kind of judicial scrutiny.""

Some passengers may not be able to fly in the next two years for health or financial reasons, advocates say. Meanwhile, the airfare they paid amounts to a no-interest loan to airlines.

The pandemic has devastated the airline industry, with billions of dollars in losses for Canadian carriers amid grounded flights and tight international borders.

In contrast to Canadian authorities, the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Transportation have required airlines to refund passengers. The U.S. and European countries including France and Germany have also offered billions in financial relief to struggling carriers, however, while Ottawa has provided no industry-specific bailout to airlines.

Since February, passengers have filed a handful of proposed class-action lawsuits and three petitions garnering more than 109,000 signatures that call for customer reimbursement.

The CTA did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.

In March, the agency said passengers ""should not simply be out-of-pocket for the cost of cancelled flights,"" but also stated that airlines facing a plunge in revenues and customer volumes ""should not be expected to take steps that could threaten their economic viability.""

""The CTA believes that, generally speaking, an appropriate approach in the current context could be for airlines to provide affected passengers with vouchers or credits for future travel, as long as these vouchers or credits do not expire in an unreasonably short period of time (24 months would be considered reasonable in most cases),"" it said on March 25.

The online statement is not an official CTA decision — these are issued periodically on complaints brought before the body — but Lukacs argues it amounts to an unsolicited advance ruling on how the agency will treat passenger complaints, and thus deters them.

Responses by officials in the airline industry and government suggest the post is viewed authoritatively.

On a conference call Friday, Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu told analysts that ""the CTA spoke clearly on the topic, and at this point...I've got no reason to believe that they'll change that.""

Transport Minister Marc Garneau has also framed the online post as an authoritative ruling.

""The Canadian Transportation Agency has ruled on this issue and has ruled that, in the present circumstances and in a non-binding way, it is acceptable for airlines to offer credits for up to two years,"" Garneau told the special all-party COVID-19 committee on May 28.

Customer reimbursement for services that were never rendered is a fundamental principle of consumer protection legislation across multiple provinces, Lukacs said.

The CTA's statement touting travel credit as an alternative has served to ""undermine"" that right, the court submission says, particularly since some credit card and insurance companies have cited the statement as a reason ""to deny policy coverage for actual travel disruptions,"" the court submission says.

The Supreme Court does not automatically hear appeals and instead issues a written decision, usually within one to three months, on whether it will consider a case.

Air Passenger Rights' leave to appeal relates to the Federal Court of Appeal's dismissal of its request for an injunction against the CTA while the case over the travel credits statement is ongoing.

Air Passenger Rights states that the appeal court's test to determine eligibility for such an injunction is too stringent, and could affect not only interprovincial transportation but all areas of federal law, including immigration and refugees, intellectual property law and Indigenous claims.

Rick Steves (ricksteves.com) writes European travel guidebooks and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio.","As we’ve had to postpone our travels because of the pandemic, I believe a weekly dose of travel dreaming can be good medicine. Here’s a reminder of the fun that awaits us in Europe at the other end of this crisis.

Iceland, with cinematic scenery showcasing nature in its rawest form, thrills outdoorsy travellers. Known for the midnight sun and northern lights, this fascinating island is equally famous for its magnificent glaciers and volcanoes.

article continues below

Among the country’s unforgettable experiences is a tour into a dormant volcano. The Thríhnúkagígur volcano, a half-hour drive from Iceland’s capital city Reykjavík, last erupted about 4,000 years ago. When its magma drained out, a cavity big enough to hold the Statue of Liberty remained.

Today, via a pricey six-hour Inside the Volcano tour (which includes three-kilometre hikes to and from the volcano), you can ride a lift through a squeezy opening at the volcano’s top, then 122 metres down into its vast chamber. Inside, lamps bring out the chamber’s pastel colors, and water, seeping through its ceiling, rains down lightly as you explore the bouldery floor.

For a shorter (one-hour) and much cheaper volcanic experience, you can visit Raufarhólshellir, billed as The Lava Tunnel — a 40-minute drive from Reykjavík. This 5,000-year-old lava tube was carved by a river of molten rock that was forced to burrow deeper after its surface had hardened. When the lava drained out, it left behind an extensive tunnel covered in colourful formations.

After passing beneath a few “skylights” where the ceiling had collapsed, you enter the intact lava tube — as big as a railroad tunnel in places. Subtle lighting brings out the tube’s soft colours and fanciful features. At the turnaround point you can experience a few minutes of utter darkness when the guide shuts off the lights.

Above ground, glacier hiking is a quintessential Icelandic experience. About 10% of Iceland is covered by glaciers, and the Sólheimajökull glacier on the South Coast is one of the most accessible.

There, several companies offer excursions of varying lengths and difficulty. A half-day outing with Icelandic Mountain Guides starts with a walk past an iceberg-filled lagoon to the foot of the glacier. Then the guide helps attach spiky crampons to your boots for the climb up spooky-looking canyons of ice and black ash.

Once on top, Sólheimajökull is smoother and whiter. As you crunch across the ice, the guide explains how the glacier moves, where those mysterious cones of black ash come from, how gaping sinkholes appear, and how climate change is melting the ice so rapidly that Sólheimajökull could disappear within a century.

Even on regular land, Iceland is a wonderland for hikers. Tórsmörk — “Thor’s Woods” — is a top destination, with well-marked trails leading to thrilling views over volcanoes, glaciers, and valleys.

Since it’s accessible only on gravel roads that require fording rushing rivers and streams, most visitors get there aboard specially equipped, jacked-up buses.

The main reason to visit Tórsmörk is the glorious hike to the top of Valahnúkur mountain. Starting from the visitors complex in Húsadalur Valley, the hike to the summit is less than two kilometres, but it’s staircase-steep in stretches and gains 275 metres in elevation.

On top, your sweat earns you a commanding view of three glacier-topped volcanoes, including the notorious Eyjafjallajökull, whose 2010 eruptions choked European air travel. Far below, the wide Markárfljót river valley sprawls to your north and the Krossá river valley to the south, their glacier-fed torrents rushing toward the sea.

For those who prefer that someone else do the hiking, horseback riding in Iceland is a special experience.

The descendants of ponies brought here by Viking settlers, Icelandic horses are small, strong and docile.

They’re renowned for their five gaits: Along with walk, trot and gallop, they have two extra “gears” — the tölt, which is fast and extremely smooth, and the high-speed “flying pace.”

A whale-watching cruise offers a more leisurely experience and a chance to spy the elusive whales of the North Atlantic. You can expect to see dolphins, porpoises and midsize minke whales (seen on local menus) rather than big humpback or blue whales.

Several tours depart from Reykjavík, but locals say the best whale-watching is in North Iceland, from the towns of Húsavík and Akureyri.

For all its ruggedness, Iceland also has its comforts — an abundance of thermal baths heated by the island’s geothermal energy. From touristy “premium” baths such as the Blue Lagoon to municipal pools favoured by locals, a thermal bath is only a short drive. Imagine wrapping up a vigorous day of exploring Iceland’s magnificent outdoors with a soothing soak in 38 C water. Aaaaahhh!

From volcano chamber explorations to geothermal pool plunges, Iceland offers adventures and activities that you can’t easily do anywhere else.

The state Department of Natural Resources said Thursday that it intends to negotiate with the University of Alaska’s Museum of the North to display the bus, which was popularized by the book ""Into the Wild"" and a movie of the same name and flown from its location near Denali National Park and Preserve last month.

""Of the many expressions of interest in the bus, the proposal from the UA Museum of the North best met the conditions we at DNR had established to ensure this historical and cultural object will be preserved in a safe location where the public could experience it fully, yet safely and respectfully, and without the spectre of profiteering,"" Natural Resources Commissioner Corri Feige said in a statement.

The bus became a beacon for those wishing to retrace the steps of Christopher McCandless, who hiked to the bus in 1992. The 24-year-old Virginia man died from starvation when he couldn’t hike back out because of the swollen Teklanika River. He kept a journal of his ordeal, which was discovered when his body was found.

McCandless’ story became famous with author Jon Krakauer’s 1996 book ""Into the Wild,"" followed nine years later by director Sean Penn’s movie of the same name.

Over the years, people from around the world have travelled to the bus, located about 25 miles (40 kilometres) from the town of Healy, to pay homage to McCandless.

Two women have drowned in the Teklanika River on such visits to the bus, one from Switzerland in 2010 and the other from Belarus nine years later. There have been 15 other search-and-rescue missions since 2009, state officials said, including five Italian tourists who needed rescue last winter. One had severe frostbite.

The draw of the bus became too much for state officials, who arranged for the Alaska Army National Guard to remove the bus with a helicopter last month as part of a training mission.

The former Fairbanks city bus is sometimes called Bus 142 or the Magic Bus. It was later used to house construction workers building a road in the area. It was abandoned in 1961, and became a shelter for those using the backcountry to recreate or hunt.

The department received dozens of suggestions for use of the bus that came from individuals, museums and institutions nationwide, with varying plans to preserve, exhibit, monetize or memorialize it, Feige said.

The department decided to consider the university’s proposal, which had several advantages. It’s just one of three official state repositories, and the only one in the Fairbanks area able to accept and curate state-owned historical items. The museum also has the staff to restore, curate and display the bus.

This proposal also allows the Department of Natural Resources to retain ownership of the bus, and decide future uses, including whether to lend it out for display and where.

""I believe that giving Bus 142 a long-term home in Fairbanks at the UA Museum of the North can help preserve and tell the stories of all these people,"" Feige said. ""It can honour all of the lives and dreams, as well as the deaths and sorrows associated with the bus, and do so with respect and dignity.""

The department anticipates signing final paperwork within the next few months."

The only routes out of western gateways between Nov. 1 and April 30 will be from Vancouver to Toronto and Montreal, as well as some connecting flights to Europe via Toronto.

Would-be passengers will automatically receive a full refund rather than the company credit that has previously been offered for flights cancelled due to the COVID-19 crisis, Transat said.

""Since the current situation does not allow us to foresee resuming routes from Western Canada in the near future and there will therefore be no direct flight options to use vouchers with Air Transat from their location, customers impacted by cancellations resulting from this suspension will receive a refund in the amount on file,"" Transat spokeswoman Marie-Christine Pouliot said in an email.

""For other locations, where more options exist, we have offered more flexibility by relaxing our travel credit policy. They are now fully transferable and have no expiry date.""

Transat cited ""the many challenges"" facing the airline industry, which revolve around a pandemic that shut down borders and grounded fleets before traffic slowly starting to pick up in the summer, though not enough to revive the critical crossborder tourism or business travel markets. The Montreal-based carrier's first flight in four months took off last week.

Transat and other Canadian airlines have refused to reimburse most customers whose flights were cancelled as a result of the coronavirus.

Transat, Air Canada and WestJet Airlines Ltd. have all said their stance on refunds aligns with federal regulations and guidance posted over the past five months by the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA).

Legal precedent, contract law suggest that's not the case, said passenger rights advocate Gabor Lukacs, noting ""the universal principal across Canada"" that customers should be reimbursed for services never rendered.

""Air Transat must refund all passengers whose flights were cancelled, regardless of their point of departure or the reason for the cancellation,"" Lukacs said, citing a CTA decision from 2004 concerning Transat as well as the carrier's own contract of carriage.

The company's crossborder tariff — a contract between airline and passenger — states that Transat ""will refund the unused ticket"" in the event of overbooking or cancellation by the airline.

Air Canada quietly changed its refund policy in June to allow some customers with cancelled flight tickets to recoup their cash — but not passengers whose trips originated in Canada.

Travellers with flights originating in the European Union, Switzerland or Iceland are entitled to receive a refund, the airline said, but passengers who were slated to fly one-way or round-trip from Canada to Europe are not.

WestJet changed its policy to reimburse customers on flights between the U.S. and Canada that were cancelled due to COVID-19 after ""carefully monitoring the regulatory frameworks"" across jurisdictions.

The country's three biggest airlines have cancelled tens of thousands of flights since late March. Air Canada saw capacity dip by 95 per cent in the spring after it lost more than $1 billion in the first quarter and projects passenger levels will not return to 2019 levels for at least three years.

Transat told The Canadian Press last week it will delay the closing deadline of its takeover by Air Canada, pushing it back by one month until Aug. 27 as European regulators and federal cabinet members mull how the $720-million acquisition will affect competition.

It was followed by Disneyland in California with 18.6 million visits, Tokyo Disneyland with 17.9 million visits and Tokyo DisneySea.

The report by the Themed Entertainment Association and the Economics Practice at AECOM said that overall attendance at the 10 biggest theme park operators in the world grew by 4% last year and climbed to 521 million visits, according to the report.

The report only looked at attendance in 2019 and didn't take into account the disruptions in the industry this year caused by the spreading coronavirus, which forced parks to close for months at a time. Parks that have reopened are operating with limits on attendance so guests can maintain social distancing. Attendance at the parks could be anywhere from a third to half of normal business volume, according to the report.

""However, it may take one to several years to return to pre-COVID operating levels, and the investment horizon of many owners may be altered due to cash flow loss,"" the report said.

Attendance at Disney theme parks around the world fell less than 1% in 2019 from the previous year. Disney is the largest theme park operator in the world by attendance.

Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida kept its title as the world's most visited park last year, with 20.9 million visits, a half per cent increase over the previous year. It was followed by Disneyland in California with 18.6 million visits, Tokyo Disneyland with 17.9 million visits and Tokyo DisneySea. All of those parks were flat from the previous year.

The flat attendance is likely due to an effort by Disney to limit entry, while charging higher prices, so that visitors have a more enjoyable experience, though in Hong Kong, a 15% drop was the result of tourism disruptions caused by protests for political reforms, the report said.

Competing in many of the same markets as Disney, Universal Parks and Resorts had an attendance jump of 2.3%, with 51.2 million visits. Most of that growth came from Universal's Islands of Adventure in Florida where attendance grew by 6%, powered by the addition of the Harry Potter-themed steel coaster, Hagrid’s Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure.

Rides based on Harry Potter intellectual property continued to drive growth at the Universal parks, the report said.

Among domestic U.S. operators, Cedar Fair Entertainment Co. had the strongest growth, with a 7.8% jump in attendance, driven by investments in new rides.

Chinese operators grew rapidly in 2019, with attendance at parks owned by the Fantawild Group increasing by 19.8% and visits at parks owned by Oct Group growing by 9.4%.

The report noted that the theme park industry has survived disruptions in the past over health and security concerns.

""While acknowledging the serious nature and consequences of the current pandemic, history shows us that people’s behaviour, with some exceptions, largely returns to normal once the threat is removed,"" the report said.

Local 362, which represents Disney World park greeters, attractions workers and custodians.","ORLANDO, Fla. — Every week, it seems, Kaila Barker, her husband and their five children change their minds about whether to travel from their home in Connecticut to Florida's Walt Disney World as planned in September.

On the one hand, the lack of crowds means more opportunities to go on rides without long waits. On the other hand, Connecticut and Florida have implemented pandemic-related quarantines for each other's residents and visitors, and the Barkers worry whether the Disney ""magic"" will get lost with mandatory mask-wearing for visitors and workers, temperature checks and no parades, fireworks shows or up-close ""meet-and-greets"" with costumed characters.

article continues below

""We keep going back and forth. It's such a hard decision to make,"" Barker said last Tuesday.

Two weeks after Disney World started opening its theme parks for the first time since closing in March because of COVID-19, the Barkers' quandary affects not only Disney World's future but that of central Florida's tourism-reliant economy.

More than 75 million visitors came to Orlando in 2018, mostly due to its reputation as a theme park mecca, which also includes Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando. But the coronavirus has upended Orlando's status as the most visited place in the U.S.

In the week that Disney World's Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom started welcoming back visitors, occupancy of hotel rooms in the Orlando area was down more than 60% from the previous year, a much deeper drop than the state as a whole, which declined more than 41%, according to STR, which tracks hotel data.

Less than half of Disney World's 43,000 unionized workers have been recalled to their old jobs, contributing to two Orlando-area counties having the state's highest unemployment rates last month — Osceola at 22.9% and Orange at 17.2%. Disney World has an overall workforce of 77,000 employees, the nation's largest single-site labour force.

Many of those still-furloughed workers are about to lose federal benefits at the end of the month.

""This is an extremely difficult moment,"" said Paul Cox, president of the local union that represents stagehands and show technicians at Disney World. ""There are still a majority of workers who are staying at home and they’re about to lose support. Things are going to get bad.""

Union officials estimate the Disney parks are no more than a third full, but that may be more by design to maintain social distancing. Disney World doesn't release attendance figures, but in pre-pandemic times its four parks and two water parks could host around 150,000 visitors a day.

Florida has had a surging coronavirus caseload recently, and other Disney parks around the globe have run into coronavirus-related roadblocks. Hong Kong Disneyland Park was forced to close earlier this month following the city’s decision to ban public gatherings of more than four people, and Disney's California parks delayed reopening while they awaited state guidelines.

Cowen Inc. estimated recently that Disney's parks and resorts won't return to pre-pandemic profitability until fiscal year 2025, and there is a ""meaningful"" probability that Disney World could close again because of the pandemic.

Leaders of the Disney World workers' unions describe the virus-related safety measures Disney has taken as ""exemplary.""

After workers complained about patrons walking around with their masks pulled down while eating food like turkey legs, Disney World updated its mandatory mask policy, requiring visitors to eat in one place while maintaining social distancing.

In response to other worker concerns, Disney has distributed personal hand sanitizer containers for workers to wear on their belts, added additional break rooms to limit the number of workers in them and reduced the number of riders on buses that shuttle workers from parking lots to the parks. Performers dressed as Disney princesses being driven in a horse-powered carriage through the parks now sit individually in rows separated by clear-plastic window partitions.

""Singing their praises seems so strange,"" said Julee Jerkovich, an official with a United Food & Commercial Workers union, which represents Disney merchandise and banquet workers. ""As far as this grand experiment, I would have to say Disney has done a really good job.""

But not all unions are happy. The union that represents actors and singers has filed a grievance with Disney World, saying their 750 members were locked out of returning to work after they complained about Disney ignoring their demands for getting coronavirus tests since they can’t wear masks while performing. Some performers, though, are eager to return to work and are pushing the union to reach an agreement with the company, as they worry about Disney replacing their shows with temporary ones featuring non-actors.

Actor's Equity Association fired a new salvo against Disney over the weekend by tweeting a re-edited version of a welcome-back video produced by the company featuring workers preparing the park for visitors. In Equity’s version, a rolling count of Florida’s coronavirus cases runs on the screen.

There have been isolated cases of workers and visitors connected to the theme parks getting sick with COVID-19, ""but we haven’t seen any large number of positive cases that come from any of the parks,"" Dr. Raul Pino, health officer for Florida's Department of Health, said last Monday.

Disney's policy of granting sick workers with paid time off so they can quarantine has made a difference, said Eric Clinton, president of Unite Here! Local 362, which represents Disney World park greeters, attractions workers and custodians.

But Clinton wonders if the current operating model can last until the pandemic is over, given that just over 20,000 of the 43,000 workers represented by unions have returned to work, only half of Disney World's 30 onsite hotels currently are back open and several in-park restaurants still are closed.

""Disney is a strong brand. They have a great product, but does the novelty wear off? Do people want to go to a theme park now? Is it more appealing with less crowds?"" Clinton said. ""I’m hopeful but nervous.""

Here’s a reminder of the fun that awaits us in Europe at the other end of this crisis.

I love exploring the world of ancient Rome, with its grand architecture, fascinating culture, and stories of larger-than-life leaders. But since many of the 2,000-year-old empire’s landmarks are reduced to ruins, it can be hard to make sense of the stones and rubble left behind.

To get a clearer picture of what everyday life in ancient Rome was really like, visit the well-preserved (and unlucky) city of Pompeii. Located just south of Naples, Pompeii was founded in 600 BC and eventually grew from its Greek and Etruscan roots into a bustling Roman trading city and port.

Neither rich nor poor, Pompeii was a typical middle-class town. To serve its 20,000 residents, the city boasted more than 40 bakeries, 130 bars, and plenty of public baths. Being a port, it also had brothels, restaurants, and entertainment venues that catered to sailors from all over the Roman world — many of whom didn’t speak a lick of Latin. Most of Pompeii’s buildings were covered in brilliant white ground-marble stucco, making it an impressive sight. And from its richly decorated forum, people had a postcard-perfect view of the looming volcano, Mount Vesuvius.

Then on Aug. 24, AD 79, everything changed. At about 1 p.m., Vesuvius sent a mushroom cloud of ash, dust, and rocks 20 kilometres into the sky. It spewed for 18 hours straight, as winds blew the cloud south toward the city. The white-grey ash settled like a heavy snow on Pompeii, its weight eventually collapsing roofs and floors (but leaving walls standing). Though most of Pompeii’s residents fled, 2,000 stayed behind.

A bad move, because the next morning a red-hot pyroclastic flow struck Pompeii, dealing a fatal blow to those who had remained, and burying the city under nine metres of volcanic ash.

After the eruption, people from nearby towns tried in vain to find the buried city. Because Pompeii was a major port, people naturally searched for it near the sea. But the eruption had filled in the harbour and pushed the coastline out, meaning Pompeii now lay inland — and its location would remain a mystery for more than 1,500 years.

In 1599, Pompeii was accidentally rediscovered during construction of a canal. Serious excavations began in 1748 and are still ongoing, making Pompeii the longest-continually-excavated site in the world.

Ironically, the ash that had destroyed Pompeii also ensured its preservation, leaving it frozen in time. As a result, its ruins offer the best look anywhere at life in an ancient Roman town, with its gridded street plan, villas and homes, commercial buildings, public baths, and colourful frescoes left remarkably intact.

Pompeii also exhibits small signs of everyday life. In the town’s many “fast food” joints, holes in the counter show where containers once held food for hungry customers to grab as a quick meal. Public drinking fountains still stand along the city’s main streets, many of which would have been lined with stalls and jammed with customers from sunup to sundown. And if you look closely at some of the walls, bright red graffiti pops out exclaiming that Julius was here.

Of course, the most compelling scenes in Pompeii are provided by its (permanent) residents. While excavating, modern archeologists detected hollow spaces in the volcanic debris that were created when victims’ bodies decomposed. By gently filling in the holes with plaster, the archeologists created molds of the Pompeiians who were caught in the disaster. The plaster casts show remarkable details — the folds of togas, the straps of sandals, the pained expressions on victims’ faces. Signs of animals have also been found, including a saddled-up horse that appears ready to carry its master to safety.

To complement your Pompeii visit, stop by the National Archaeological Museum in Naples. The museum is home to Pompeii’s finest art and artifacts, including a display (in the “Secret Room”) of erotic frescoes that were considered so bawdy that by the time they made it here, in 1819, they could be viewed only with permission from the king. (From Naples, Pompeii is easily reached via a CitySightseeing bus or the handy — but shabby — Circumvesuviana commuter train.)

Excavations at Pompeii experienced a renaissance in 2018, when new artifacts and skeletons were discovered in a section of the city yet to be fully unearthed. With fresh secrets sure to be revealed over time, evocative Pompeii will be worth visiting again and again.

But the mayor of Gaspe, Que., a popular tourist destination on the Gaspe peninsula's eastern coast, is concerned some visitors are camping anywhere they find space, harming the environment and upsetting locals.

article continues below

""We're seeing a lot of tents on public beaches, in forests, on private land without the approval of the owners of that land,"" Mayor Daniel Cote said in an interview Thursday.

Cote said he had high hopes tourists would come to the Gaspe this summer despite the pandemic. Authorities had closed off the region to outsiders earlier this year to stop the spread of COVID-19.

But Cote said he was caught off guard by the number of tourists who arrived without hotel or camping reservations. ""People invaded public beaches and decided that that's where they would set up camp,"" he said.

A series of photos posted on Facebook Wednesday showed tents and camping chairs lined up along a beach, as well as empty beer cans and other garbage littering the sand. The Canadian Press could not independently verify the photos, which purportedly were taken at Haldimand Beach in Gaspe.

The post was shared nearly 600 times as of Thursday afternoon and garnered over 300 comments, many of which criticize the tourists and demand the town take action. Cote said public beaches are under provincial authority, so the municipality has limited means to intervene.

But he said Gaspe intends to hire people to patrol busy public areas and inform visitors of the rules, which include a ban on driving vehicles on public beaches and to safely dispose trash.

The town is also working with Quebec provincial police and the nearby Mi'kmaq Nation of Gespeg to protect the area, Cote added. ""As a municipality we don't have coercive power to force people to leave the areas ... so we're going to go with raising awareness.""

In a statement Thursday, officials with the Mi'kmaq Nation of Gespeg said unregulated camping in the area had gotten ""out of control"" and was negatively affecting local wildlife and ecosystems.

""On the beaches, washed up wood, which is important for slowing erosion, is being burned without knowledge of its consequences,"" the statement reads. ""Migratory birds are being disturbed on their nesting grounds. We cannot even keep track of the amount of waste that litters the waters, the beaches, the parking lots, and rest areas.""

The regional public health authority launched an awareness campaign this month to prevent the potential spread of COVID-19 in the Gaspe region amid the wave of tourists.

Small teams are being deployed across the region to make sure people are respecting public health guidelines, explained Clemence Beaulieu-Gendron, a spokeswoman for CISSS de la Gaspesie. She said several local mayors have asked the public health teams to come to their towns.

So far, a team of four outreach workers is working in the area of Sainte-Anne-des-Monts, on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River, while others have been sent to Gaspe, Perce, and Carleton-sur-Mer.

""They're not police. It's important to say that,"" Beaulieu-Gendron said about the workers, in an interview. ""It's really to raise awareness to avoid a second wave, or in any case, to decrease the risk of spreading the virus in the region during summer vacation.""

Lily Gang, the owner of Motel-Camping Fort Ramsay in Gaspe, said this summer seems just as busy as in past years. Her business counts 32 motel rooms and 42 camp sites, which normally can accommodate both trailers and tents.

But Gang said she chose not to take any reservations for tent camping this year because she felt uneasy with clients using the communal restrooms and showers during the COVID-19 pandemic. She said she also feared campers could put her cleaning staff at risk.

""I don't know how to handle so many people together,"" Gang said in an interview.

Cote said the region typically receives 800,000 visitors every summer, but this year he expects more. He said he intends to speak to the provincial government this fall to make sure the public beaches aren't overrun again next year.

In the meantime, he encouraged tourists to plan their trips to the region ahead of time — and only visit if they have reservations. ""It will make us very happy to welcome you, as long as you behave respectfully towards people in the area.""

There are options for connections to other Canadian airports, including Prince George and Fort McMurray, Alta., as well as Saskatoon and Regina — all new destinations also announced on Thursday.

The Edmonton-based airline, which is using four Boeing 737-800 jets, also flies to Toronto, Winnipeg, Edmonton, Calgary and Kelowna.

Jim Scott, chief executive of Flair, called the return to Victoria “a much-anticipated” move.

“We continuously receive requests from our passengers to service these communities,” Scott said. “Many of these areas are experiencing reduced accessibility and we know that Canadians need affordable air fares now more than ever. We are committed to supporting these communities across the country as they safely reopen to travel.”

Flair had a brief presence in Victoria in 2016 and again in 2018. It had worked with Winnipeg-based NewLeaf Travel Co., which ran low-cost flights between Victoria and Kamloops, Edmonton and Winnipeg. NewLeaf began service in July 2016 and suspended it late that year. Flair purchased NewLeaf in mid-2017.

Flair also initiated a seasonal service from Victoria to Edmonton in 2018.

The airline’s base fare pays for a seat. Victoria passengers heading to Fort McMurray, for example, would pay $49 to get to Vancouver, and then another $79 for the leg to Fort McMurray.

Passengers can pay more for options, such as a middle seat for social-distancing and checked luggage.

Flair said safety during the pandemic is its highest priority. Passengers must have masks, answer a health-check questionnaire and have their temperatures taken prior to boarding.

Beginning Monday, free day-use passes will be available for certain areas of six provincial parks.

The passes will be required for the Berg Lake trail at Mount Robson Park, the Chief Peaks trail at Stawamus Chief Park, upper mountain trails at Cypress and Mount Seymour parks, parts of Garibaldi Park and all trails and day-use areas of Golden Ears Park.

Garibaldi Park, which has remained closed due to the pandemic, will fully reopen Monday with the introduction of the day passes at the Diamond Head, Rubble Creek and Cheakamus trailheads.

Although the parks have wide-open spaces, the government says in a statement that most visitors are confined to trails that can become crowded in areas like viewpoints.

It says overuse can have environmental impacts like trail widening, soil erosion, altered hydrology and damaged vegetation.

""People in B.C. love the outdoors, but some of our most popular parks are experiencing a high number of visitors, resulting in crowded facilities, packed parking lots and safety issues, such as parking along the highway,"" Environment Minister George Heyman says in the statement.

The passes will be released each day on the Discover Camping website for same-day bookings. The number of passes available vary.

They range from vehicle passes for Golden Ears Park and the Berg Lake Trail at Mount Robson Park to individual trail passes at other parks for morning, afternoon or full-day bookings.

Bruce Passmore, executive director of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society's B.C. chapter, says the organization strongly supports reopening the parks while working to manage visits and conserve nature.

""With many people staying home this summer, the demand for outdoor recreation continues to surge, putting more pressure on our park system. We welcome solutions that will help manage overcrowding in certain areas and strengthen our opportunity to protect vital ecosystems,"" he says.

Backcountry campers with camping permits are not required to reserve a day-pass but should carry proof of their camping permit if they use any of the trails that require a pass.

Visitors can download passes on their mobile devices and park staff will check them upon arrival.

Some parks remain closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a full list showing park status is available on the BC Parks website.

Surrounded by the ocean, views of neighbouring mountains, bountiful forests, beautiful rivers and falls, and places of wonderful solitude. What it has lacked is a multi-day, inn-to-inn trail that brings this all together in one long-distance hike. Until now.

With the opening of the Sooke Hills Wilderness Trail in the summer of 2017, it is now possible to hike from the Mount Wells parking area in Langford to the town of Lake Cowichan over three days — all on trails — and all without needing a car to get back to Victoria.

The first day, over the Sooke Hills Wilderness Trail with its amazing views from the Malahat, ends at a B&B halfway up the west side of Shawnigan Lake.

The second day, up the Cowichan Valley Trail and over the Kinsol Trestle, ends in Duncan.

The third day, partly along the Cowichan River and with more amazing views, ends in Lake Cowichan. The return from Lake Cowichan to Victoria can be done that same evening or the next morning via a combination of B.C. Transit and the Tofino Bus.

The three legs of the hike range from 25 to 28 kilometres. The first day is the most challenging, with a long and relatively steep ascent, followed by a long stretch of undulating trail.

The second and third days are easier, mostly following old rail tracks (except a few optional but desirable stretches by the Cowichan River on the third day).

Because breakfast and dinner are available at all locations, hikers need only carry the clothes they will need for the three days, some food for lunch and water — so backpack weight is manageable (unlike, say, Cheryl Strayed’s “Monster” from her book Wild).

This hike is certainly challenging and shouldn’t be done without reasonably good conditioning, but the rewards are amazing. The hike winds its way through some of the finest scenery that Vancouver Island has to offer and provides all sorts of time to unwind and enjoy nature.

I did this hike on my own (in late January) and met no more than 10 people on the trail during the entire trip.

If you seek solitude, then this hike is for you. The only sounds I heard were the wind through the trees, birds and rushing waters. Well, I also heard the sounds of logging at times, but accepted this as one of the reasons that some forest trails even exist.

While long-distance walking is a novelty for many Canadians, it has long been popular in Europe: Miles of established paths criss-cross the continent, and in England, they are often clearly marked and cared for. If a path unravels across a farm, the farmer is the caretaker of that expanse. Many enthusiasts belong to the Long Distance Walkers Association, based in England. Founded in 1972, the association is a clearinghouse for information and organizes long-distance walks.

Long-distance walkers aren’t necessarily campers. Even when they do go on adventurous multi-day excursions, they’re just as likely to spend the night at a bed and breakfast where they can take a shower and have a beer. There are even businesses that will carry your gear for you. Long-distance walkers go solo, but they also go in groups.

The wonderful thing about long-distance walking is that there’s a low barrier of entry. It is not as physically daunting as, say, running a marathon. But it is, of course, hard work. After a number of kilometres, one’s feet can definitely start aching.

Blisters are often the bane of the long-distance walker. Several threads on the association’s forums are devoted to how best to combat, treat and drain blisters. Methods discussed include an absorbing plaster called “Compeed,” duct tape, and immersing sweaty feet in a bag of corn flour. But the bodily toll is worth it!

Studies have shown that long-distance walking can facilitate relief and disengagement from common stresses and problems in life and can help people find ways to resolve their issues. Moreover, long-distance walking can build confidence and a sense of purpose and provide opportunities for reflection. Studies also show that “forest bathing,” a practice that originated in Japan in the late 1980s, increases immunity, decreases the risk of cancer and helps you to recover from illness faster.

Keep all this in mind as you contemplate the hike, day by day.

Day 1: Langford to Shawnigan Lake

The hike begins at the Mount Wells parking lot on Humpback Road. B.C. Transit (Route 65 from downtown Victoria) will get you about 1.5 kilometres — a 20-minute walk — from the trailhead. The other alternative is to take a cab.

The first 2.5 kilometres of the trail are beautiful, passing the Waugh Creek Falls and crossing the Goldstream River Suspension Bridge. At 2.5 kilometres, the trail passes a gate and becomes a service road (for the Victoria watershed) and climbs steadily for the next seven kilometres. At 9.5 kilometres, the service road ends at another gate and morphs back into a true trail.

For the next four kilometres, which are the highest elevations for the trail, there are great views of Mount Baker to the east and the Olympic mountains to the south. The last kilometre of this stretch is a wonderful piece of single-track trail through a forest up to Stebbings Road.

Now you are on the Cowichan Valley Trail, dropping down into a forest, often running by a creek, crossing the lovely little Shawnigan Creek Bridge at the 20-kilometre mark. This stretch ends at Sooke Lake Road at the 22-kilometre mark.

From here, it is a flat six kilometres, with glimpses of Shawnigan Lake to the east, to the night’s destination — the delightful Stonekroft Guest House (just east of the trail, across Shawnigan Lake Road at 2021 Marble Rd.).

Day 2: Shawnigan Lake to Duncan

Resuming the trail where you left it the day before, cross the small McGee Trestle at the two-kilometre mark and the magnificent and historic Kinsol Trestle at the 9.5-kilometre mark.

In contrast to the first day, the trail on the second day is generally flat, with more wide-open vistas.

About the 21.5-kilometre mark (about four kilometres west of Duncan and 200 metres after crossing Shawnigan Road), there is a small trail branching off the right/east toward Duncan, the night’s destination. This trail ends after about three kilometres at Glenora Road.

From there, it is another one or two kilometres on roads to Duncan, where there are several accommodation options (I stayed at McLay Guest House).

Day 3: Duncan to Lake Cowichan

Rather than retracing your steps to the fork in the trail west of Duncan (which makes for a very long day of more than 30 kilometres), take a taxi from Duncan to the Glenora Trails Head Park (which shaves eight kilometres off the day’s hike). From that point, it is about 25 kilometres to Lake Cowichan, including time spent on some of the smaller trails running beside the Cowichan River.

The trail crosses the Holt Creek Trestle, the 64.4 Mile Trestle, the 66 Mile Trestle and the 70.2 Mile Trestle.

Highlights of the day include the five kilometres of trail by the Cowichan River just past the Holt Creek Trestle (there is a sign for this just past the trestle, where a small trail branches off to the right and initially follows Holt Creek) and the North Side trail that is accessed just past 66 Mile Trestle (on the left-hand side).

The latter trail takes you along spectacular bluff tops high above the river, until the Horseshoe Bend Group Campground, at which point the trail becomes more bucolic and travels alongside the river until reaching Skutz Falls.

From there, the trail is relatively flat and straight, eventually spilling out in Lake Cowichan, where there are several options for accommodation if you want to overnight before heading back to Victoria.

The details

What to bring

Definitely look at the weather forecast to determine clothing needs. Smartwool tops are great because they can go several days without needing to be washed. Bring a change of clothes to relax in during the evenings.

For food, bring some energy bars for snacks and lunches for Day 1 and Day 2 (lunch for Day 3 can be bought in Duncan).

Depending on the temperature, plan to bring two to three litres of water each day (there are no places to pick up water during the day).

A 25- to 30-litre backpack should be fine to carry clothes, water and food.

Hiking poles aren’t really needed — the trail is not technical except for some mildly technical stretches alongside the Cowichan River.

For the same reason, hiking shoes aren’t really required — running shoes will suffice for the most part (though hiking shoes will keep feet warmer in winter).

Where to stay

Following Day 1, the only option is the Stonekroft Guest House, which is just off Shawnigan Lake at 2021 Marble Rd. The hosts, Jude and Tom, are very considerate and make a wonderful breakfast.

Dinner at the end of Day 1 can be obtained from Sarpino’s Pizzeria, which will deliver to Stonekroft and which makes great pizza (there are no restaurants within walking distance of the Stonekroft).

Following Day 2, there are several accommodation options in Duncan. There are places in southwest Duncan that are closer to the trail, but it is still necessary to walk into town for dinner and to buy provisions for lunch on Day 3.

Following Day 3, there is accommodation in Lake Cowichan or the possibility of returning to Victoria by bus.

Transportation

The Mount Wells parking lot, the start of the trail, can be accessed by taking a cab or by B.C. Transit (the nearest stop, on Route 65, is about 1.5 kilometres from the trailhead).

From Lake Cowichan, the end of the trail, there is a B.C. Transit bus (Route 7) to Duncan.

From Duncan, Tofino Bus travels to downtown Victoria. However, while the Tofino Bus runs that route daily, its only evening runs are on Fridays and Sundays.

If you are arriving in Lake Cowichan on any other day, it is necessary to overnight there and then take the Tofino bus from Duncan the next morning.

When to go

With the right clothing and footwear, this hike can be done year-round (except after heavy snowfalls). The trail will generally not get too muddy in the rain (except the branch trails running by the Cowichan River).

Which direction to go

Either direction is possible, but the advantage of south to north is that it will mean not walking into the sun.

Longer and shorter alternatives

This can be shortened to a two-day hike by either ending in Duncan or by doing an out-and-back to Shawnigan Lake. Alternatively, it can be made a four-day hike by hiking back from Lake Cowichan to Duncan.

Alone or with others?

Hiking long-distance trails on your own can provide the opportunity to enjoy the sounds of nature, go at your own pace and better reflect and meditate. On the other hand, hiking with others provides the opportunity to share a wonderful experience and can help the time go by faster.

Maps

While the trail is well marked and maps aren’t really required, the following maps are useful:

• Sooke Hills Wilderness Regional Park Map

• Cowichan Valley Trail, Malahat Connector Map

• Cowichan Valley Trail Map

• Cowichan River Provincial Park Map (particularly good for noting the trails leaving the main trail to go by the Cowichan River)

It is also a good idea to bring a smartphone, which can be used to determine where you are on the trail (though cell coverage is spotty in some areas) and to provide maps of Duncan and Lake Cowichan.

Ken Armour is an avid hiker and has hiked numerous long-distance trails in England and Switzerland, including the Tour du Mont Blanc. This spring, he is planning to hike the Great Glen Way in Scotland and the Northumberland Coast Path in northeastern England. When not hiking on trails, Ken also enjoys trail running and the many trail races in the Victoria region. Ken works at the B.C.

Park at the Elk River Trailhead.","Cradled below towering mountains at the centre of Vancouver Island is a lake whose name tells the landscape's history.

Landslide Lake caught the face of one the Island's tallest mountains when a magnitude-7.3 earthquake shook it loose in 1946.

""The northeast slope of (Mount) Colonel Foster fractured off and fell into the lake. And the lake subsequently had a tsunami, or a big wave, that hurdled down the whole valley and took a whole bunch of trees or vegetation with it,"" said Marlene Smith, co-founder of Friends of Strathcona Park.

Today, hikers can climb up the smooth rock face left by the wave's path to reach the lake's icy, teal waters.

Vancouver Island is well known for its coastal trails, but the alpine peaks and mountain valleys at its centre are also lined with day and overnight hikes in Strathcona Park, British Columbia's oldest provincial park.

The journey to Landslide Lake begins at the Elk River Trailhead off Highway 28, between Campbell River and Gold River.

Hikers can stop at the nearby volunteer-run Strathcona Wilderness Institute for information about the park.

While experienced hikers can do the 26-kilometre round trip hike in about nine hours, Smith recommends packing a tent and making it an overnight adventure. An average hiker will take four to six hours to reach the campsite, which is another hour or two from the lake.

""It's a beautiful trail, which is hikeable for almost all ages, although you have to be reasonably fit, because it's quite long,"" Smith said.

From the trailhead, a wide path meanders through old-growth stands of Douglas fir, hemlock and cedar. The toughest parts of the trek are its first and last sections, with a total elevation rise of 600 metres.

The trail mostly parallels Elk River, which is prone to gush when there's too much rain, snow or glacial melt. There is also an avalanche risk in winter and early spring.

That makes July and August — the driest months — best for a visit, although hikers often make their way through between late spring and early fall.

""Bridges and parts of the trail are prone to flood, so I always recommend people check to make sure it is not flooded, but accessible,"" Smith said.

Matthew Lettington, president of Island Mountain Ramblers, also warned hikers to plan their trips before they start, since cellular and satellite reception is spotty in the park.

He first visited the trail about eight years ago.

""I was surprised how deep between the mountains we were. There are sections in there, still, where we'll lose our GPS signals because the mountains are so tall. It's called a 'box canyon,'"" Lettington said.

For those interested in extending the adventure, a more rugged trail along the eastern edge of Landslide Lake leads to another turquoise, glacial lake known colloquially as Berg Lake.

Little icebergs may float at the surface or it may be frozen over, depending on the time of year.

Ice caves also form along its edge, but enter at your own risk, as they're prone to collapse.

""Those aren't there every year. Sometimes you have heavy, heavy snow and hard winters that persist into September. Other years, there may be no snow accumulated in those place, so it's always changing,"" Lettington said.

“Thursday’s ceremony was a huge milestone for the project,” said Ken Milbrath, president of the Vancouver Island Trail Association, who is overseeing the trail’s creation.

The association, formed in 2009, has been steadily linking existing backcountry hiking routes through public land. The trail winds through forests as well as rugged coastlines.

Only 140 kilometres of trail, all sitting in private land owned by two forest companies, remain to be added to complete it.

The main blockade is two sections around Cowichan Lake and Port Alberni. The two sections — essentially old logging roads — have been closed to public access over concerns regarding liability.

With regional governments signalling that they would be open to classifying the trail as an easement, the last sections could join the trail in “a couple of years,” Milbrath said.

“When complete, the Vancouver Island Trail has the potential to become an economic driver for the region.”

Liz Bicknell, president of the Outdoor Club of Victoria, agrees.

“The opening of the trail can be a boon for smaller communities that are now just dependent on the forestry industry,” said Bicknell, who is also the fundraising director for the Vancouver Island Trail Association.

“Hikers will need food, accommodation and other ancillary businesses so vital for smaller communities.”

A hike along the trail in its entirety would take between two to three months; Milbrath said people are already taking day trips and overnight trips on existing portions of the trail.

One of the most famous hiking routes is the Camino de Santiago, which is nearly 800 kilometres in length. The path, an UNESCO World Heritage Site, was once used by pilgrims to visit a religious shrine in Spain.

“I like to tell people that a trip along the Vancouver Island Trail is no less spectacular, with hikers encountering 49 separate First Nations along the way,” Milbrath said. “All have different history of art, culture and language to tell.”

The opening will be followed up with the planned erection of a kiosk in Anderson Hill Park, with plaques giving information on the trail.

The society is accepting donations to help cover the cost of trail construction.

Alonso was sixth on the speed chart when he crashed. He ended up ninth for the day.

""It is just the way it is,"" Alonso said. ""Fortunately it happened today and not on (race day). We will learn from this. Nothing we can do now and tomorrow we start again.""

Alonso is making his third attempt to win the final leg of motorsports' version of the Triple Crown. The two-time Formula One champion has victories in the Monaco Grand Prix and 24 Hours of Le Mans, with Indianapolis the only race missing from the trifecta.

He had a strong car in 2017 when he raced at Indianapolis for Andretti Autorsport but an engine failure ended his shot at victory. Alonso failed to qualify for the Indy 500 last year in an effort from McLaren.

He also crashed during Indy 500 practice last year and it contributed to the many setbacks the McLaren team had during its preparations. The McLaren backup car was not the proper shade of orange and Alonso lost valuable practice time as the colour was corrected.

Alonso's crash with just over 50 minutes remaining in Thursday's session was the first wreck since the track opened Wednesday for practice.

Meanwhile, five-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon topped the speed charts at the end of the day with a lap at 226.102 mph for Chip Ganassi Racing. He was followed by Takuma Sato at 225.693 and Marco Andretti at 225.249 mph as Honda's took the top three spots.

Conor Daly at 225.106 was fourth and the fastest Chevrolet.

James Hinchcliffe of Oakville, Ont., was 17th and Dalton Kellett of Stouffville, Ont., was 28th.

There is one more day of practice before qualifying, called ""Fast Friday"" as IndyCar gives teams a horsepower boost to increase speeds. Defending race winner Simon Pagenaud said Team Penske had a deliberate plan to work on handling Thursday and will worry about speed during Fast Friday practice.

""I have no interest in drafting and getting a big number out there,"" Pagenaud said. ""There's no interest for me to do that. I know I can win this race and I know what I need. That's more important than drafting and putting up a big number."""

To prepare for Indy, Pearn took a very literal approach — ""I had to read the rule book,"" he said.","INDIANAPOLIS — There is not much the owner of a backcountry skiing and hiking vacation company in Canada can do with a lifetime of racing knowledge after he has walked away from a championship-winning career.

Cole Pearn abruptly retired at the end of last year's NASCAR season after helping build one of the best teams in stock car racing. His life on the road cost him too much time with his young family and relocating from Colorado to North Carolina had limited their access to outdoor adventures.

They returned to his native Canada to operate Golden Alpine Holidays in British Columbia, a venture that has been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. Racing has also been scrambled, and when the Indianapolis 500 was moved from May to Aug. 23, one of the Ed Carpenter Racing engineers had a conflict.

It created an opening at Carpenter on Conor Daly's car. One of Carpenter's crew members had worked with Pearn before and the connection was made: Pearn, the crew chief of Martin Truex Jr.'s 2017 NASCAR championship season, would work the Indianapolis 500.

""They asked. It was like, ‘Yeah, why not?’"" said Pearn, who called the Indy 500 a bucket list event. ""It's hard when you race your whole life and just completely turn it all off. So it's kind of nice to scratch that itch at the same time.""

Daly, in his first day working with Pearn, was ninth fastest around Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The Chevrolet was even faster Thursday, when Daly briefly sat atop the speed chart before Takuma Sato bumped him down a spot. He ended the day fourth overall in speed.

""We made some really good changes overnight and Cole has an idea of what he wants to do. He's got an interesting way of working, he's like ‘Yep, I know exactly what I want to do,’"" Daly said. ""I really like communicating with him and I think we are vibing really well.""

Daly, making his seventh Indy 500 start, finished a career-best 10th in his hometown race last season while running for Andretti Autosport. A scrapper who has pieced together a full IndyCar season swapping between Carpenter for oval races and Carlin Racing for street and road course events, the 28-year-old Daly is trying to stabilize his career.

Daly will try to parlay a strong 500 into full-time work while relying on a part-time engineer in the 37-year-old Pearn.

""I’ve learned to just try to get along with everyone,"" Daly said. ""I’m a very trusting individual. Obviously, Cole has an incredible amount of experience in the racing world. Was a driver himself, as well. He knows what’s going on.""

Pearn's most noted success is in stock cars and a five-year stint as Truex's crew chief that produced 24 Cup Series victories. The team raced for the title three consecutive years, finishing second in back-to-back seasons after the 2017 championship.

Things began to change when Furniture Row Racing closed at the end of the 2018 season and Pearn and Truex were pulled into Joe Gibbs Racing. They won seven races and were runner-up to teammate Kyle Busch in the title race when Pearn decided he'd had enough.

He has since watched NASCAR on television and provides both insightful and comedic commentary on social media. Pearn recognized he missed racing.

""For sure missed the competition side,"" Pearn said. ""This is obviously a fully different experience, but racing is still racing. You throw a green and checkered.""

To prepare for Indy, Pearn took a very literal approach — ""I had to read the rule book,"" he said.

He's always followed IndyCar and his racing experience qualifies Pearn for the crossover that few expect will be a difficult transition.

""I grew up knowing these cars, it's not like it's anything crazy,"" Pearn said. ""In some regards it is kind of simple and it's just about understanding the procedures and how we set the cars up, learn how tech goes. The physics is honestly the easiest part, understanding how everything else works is the harder part.""

When Carpenter made the hire, he had no doubt bringing in Pearn would be seamless and give Daly a shot at winning the Indianapolis 500.

""I believe when you bring in smart and talented people that have a work ethic, they’re going to figure it out,"" Carpenter said. ""There’s a lot that’s different but a lot of the processes are the same. Some of the language is different. He’s definitely putting in the work to do it, getting prepared. A lot of what we’re doing at Indy is making decisions in the moment. I think we all feel like Cole has those traits."""

Neither Cassirer's heirs nor Spain's Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum dispute the painting's early history.
Both U.S. District Judge John Walter, in a 2019 ruling, and the appeals court in Tuesday's, criticized the baron and the Spanish foundation for not doing more to discover whether the painting was looted art.
Both courts also criticized Spain for not living up to what the courts called ""moral commitments"" to return Nazi-looted art.
But that is the state of the law,"" the appeals court said in its ruling.","LOS ANGELES — A U.S. appeals court has ruled that a Camille Pissarro painting a Jewish woman traded to the Nazis to escape the Holocaust in 1939 may remain the property of a Spanish museum that acquired it more than a half-century later.

The unanimous ruling issued Monday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest — but possibly not the last — in a case that has wound through the courts of Spain and the United States for 20 years.

article continues below

At stake is ""La Rue St. Honoré, effet de Soleil, Après-Midi, 1898,"" an oil-on-canvas work of a rain-swept Paris street that Pissarro painted as he gazed at the scene from his hotel window. Its value has been estimated at $30 million.

Lilly Cassirer’s father-in-law bought it directly from Pissarro’s art dealer and left it to her and her husband when he died. In 1939, she traded it to the Nazis in exchange for exit visas for herself, her husband and her grandson, who eventually settled in the U.S. Her great-grandson, David Cassirer of San Diego, has continued the litigation since his father's death.

Neither Cassirer's heirs nor Spain's Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum dispute the painting's early history.

What's at issue all these years later is whether Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza made any serious effort to determine the painting was looted art when he acquired it from a New York gallery owner for $275,000 in 1976.

Also whether Spanish curators did their due diligence in tracing its provenance when a Spanish non-profit foundation acquired it and hundreds of other paintings from the baron's collection in 1992 and created the Madrid museum that bears his name.

Lilly Cassirer’s heirs say she spent years trying to recover the painting before concluding it was lost and accepting $13,000 in reparations from the German government in 1958.

It wasn’t until 1999 that her grandson, Claude, who had vividly recalled seeing it hanging in the family's German home, discovered it in the Madrid museum. After Spain refused to hand it over, he sued.

Attorney Thaddeus Stauber, who has represented the museum since the case reached U.S. courts in 2005, hailed Monday's decision, noting that the painting was sold and resold to numerous legitimate and prominent collectors over the years before the baron obtained it, with none discovering it had been seized by the Nazis.

He said there also appeared to be no effort by Thyssen-Bornemisza or any other collector to hide it from the public.

""We've been transparent from the start of this case, and we're very pleased that there's been a trial now and it brings it to a conclusion, we trust,"" he said Tuesday.

He did say the Cassirer family may appeal to the full 9th Circuit or even the U.S. Supreme Court.

The family did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday, but the president of the Holocaust Survivors Foundation USA denounced the decision.

""The Nazis murdered more than 6 million Jews, including 1.5 million children under the age of 12, and including 105 members of my family,"" David Schaecter said. ""How on God’s Earth can Spain fight so hard to deny a Jewish family its precious legacy that was looted by the Nazis? And how on God’s Earth can an American court ignore the unprecedented trauma of the Holocaust and reward Spain for its greed?""

Both U.S. District Judge John Walter, in a 2019 ruling, and the appeals court in Tuesday's, criticized the baron and the Spanish foundation for not doing more to discover whether the painting was looted art. But both courts concluded there was no proof either deliberately hid that it was.

Both courts also criticized Spain for not living up to what the courts called ""moral commitments"" to return Nazi-looted art.

""It is perhaps unfortunate that a country and a government can preen as moralistic in its declarations, yet not be bound by those declarations. But that is the state of the law,"" the appeals court said in its ruling."

If you're feeling anxious or stressed about back to school shopping and advertisements are making you feel you better get to a store soon, Lee says not worry.
""Find out more about what your school district is doing, and then adjust according to that.","TORONTO — Vonny Sweetland has yet to decide if he will be sending his 12-year-old sister Josephine back to class in September, but just in case he does, he's been stocking up on supplies for months.

He picks up hand sanitizer when he sees it in stores, grabbed new masks last month, bought a fresh uniform and has been testing out Josephine's muscle power with some new lunch containers.

The new additions to her backpack and are all part of a wave of changes families — and their wallets — are being confronted with as they prepare for back to school, whether it's sourcing protective equipment or choosing a thermos their child can open unassisted.

""In a COVID-era, all of these things we take for granted or think are minuscule are actually really important,"" said Sweetland, who is his sister's guardian.

""These are things as simple as a teacher helping you unpack your lunch or zipping a zipper. To prevent potential spread, I don't think teachers are really going to be doing these things.""

The cost of so many new supplies can easily add up.

A Deloitte survey of 1,200 parents who have at least one child attending school in grades K-12 this fall found the average family will spend $102 on school supplies, $216 on clothing and accessories, $395 on computers and hardware, $316 on electronic gadgets and digital subscriptions.

The survey, which was conducted between May and July, found those families will allocate $61 on a new category: home or health supplies.

Even so, back-to-school shopping doesn't have to be more expensive than any other year, said Seung Hwan (Mark) Lee, an associate professor of retail management at Ryerson University.

He recommends shoppers compare prices and take advantage of sales.

Anne Marie Taber said she's noticed plenty of sales, though she hasn't sought them out when shopping with seven-year-old daughter Avery because she tries to minimize her time in stores and instead use online options with delivery to lessen her exposure to the virus.

She stocked up as soon as she could on Old Navy's uniform-style clothing because several sizes were out of stock and also grabbed Avery a new backpack.

On top of masks and hand sanitizers, they bought a wide-mouth water bottle without a straw to make cleaning easy, plastic Duo-Tangs that can be wiped down and a set of art supplies that Avery has been reminded not to share.

""This is extra stuff we haven't had to buy in the past but it's a small dollar to pay to make sure that that is just hers exclusively,"" Taber said.

Parents may also want to consider disposable cutlery, if they have children that bring lunches to school and are worried about germs spreading through anything reuseable, Lee said.

If your child is doing virtual classes, he suggests ensuring you have a reliable laptop or tablet with a webcam.

Those who want to go all out or are older and have specific needs for programs they are enrolled in, may need to think about microphones and speakers too.

Those supplies don't come cheap. However, the cost of those high-ticket items could be partially offset by a change he sees happening across universities and colleges during the pandemic.

""It's no longer really about carrying around the heavy textbooks,"" he said.

""Many professors aren't holding lengthy exams because the exams are becoming very difficult to monitor and you can't really get a proctor to look at how students are conducting their exams... so using test banks or textbooks no longer apply.""

If you're feeling anxious or stressed about back to school shopping and advertisements are making you feel you better get to a store soon, Lee says not worry.

""I would advise parents right now not to rush into getting supplies,"" he said.

""Find out more about what your school district is doing, and then adjust according to that. A deal can always be had.""

Each summer, the former U.S. president unveils a selection of his favourite songs of the season.

Most of the artists are household names, but Obama often leaves room to showcase a few lesser-known acts, much to their surprise.

""It's cool to think that Obama, or the Obamas together, have listened to my music,"" he said.

""It's a really nice feeling to think my music has gone that far.""

""Neon Skyline"" is a particularly Canadian song choice because its story unravels inside the Skyline Restaurant, a real-life diner in Toronto's Parkdale neighbourhood, where two friends agree to meet for a beer shortly before one runs into his ex.

Shauf, who was born in Regina, said he frequented the Skyline when he moved to Toronto several years back

""It became a really friendly place to hang out and the setting for my record,"" he said.

Shauf has been a critical favourite in Canada for years. He was nominated for multiple Juno Awards, and ""The Neon Skyline"" landed on the long list of Polaris Prize contenders for this year's best album.

Fellow Canadian artists Drake and PartyNextDoor also showed up on Obama's list.

Both of them shared billing on Popcaan's track ""Twist & Turn,"" while Drake was also featured for his part on Rihanna's megahit ""Work.""

PartyNextDoor, who is Mississauga, Ont.-raised rapper Jahron Brathwaite, made a second appearance for his solo effort ""PGT,"" taken from his 2020 album, ""Partymobile.""

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

article continues below

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.

Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.

But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.

""There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,"" said Turnbull. ""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.""

Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.

She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.

""We don't like their representative very much,"" he said of her in September 2018.

Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said ""Mama (does not equal) chopped liver."" On the back it said ""Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.""

When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.

And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.

""She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,"" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.

He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.

""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.

""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.

""I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,"" he said. ""And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.""

She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.

""What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,"" Kelly said on Twitter. ""This has been missing in the department for several years.""

MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.

While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.

Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.

Trudeau said Tuesday that she had been ""a key player in my government from day one.""

The five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations are upset that Ottawa decided to give a surplus allocation of salmon — which arose this year due to reduced recreational fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic — to commercial fishers rather than to the First Nations.

Clifford Atleo, lead negotiator for one of the nations who is also called Wickaninnish, says he feels sports and commercial troll fishers are given more rights to fish in the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

He says the latest decision to shut First Nations fishers out of an opportunity to catch more chinook salmon this year shows systemic racism is ""alive and well"" within the federal fisheries department.

""We feel very strongly we're not being dealt with fairly, we know we're not being dealt with fairly,"" Atleo said.

""It's just another layer of disappointment on the part of how the government deals with us. The government doesn't realize that their attitude toward our people is dyed-in-the-wool ... And I think the government — sometimes they don't realize they're being racist. They've got age-old policies that have never changed.""

A 2018 B.C. Supreme Court ruling directed Ottawa to take a more ""generous approach"" to allocations of chinook salmon to the First Nations given the importance of this species to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people.

The ruling from B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Humphries noted that the government's salmon allocation policy at the time gave recreational fisherman priority to fish for chinook and soho salmon ahead of the First Nations and advised the fisheries minister to reassess this policy.

Despite this ruling and changes that have since placed the First Nations at a higher priority than sport fishers, the Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ehattesaht and Mowachaht/Muchalaht nations say their yearly fishing allocations have not increased.

This year, the five First Nations were told they could fish 7,724 chinook, which amounts to just 1.5 fish per person for the 5,000 members of their communities.

COVID-19 brought a new dynamic to the salmon allocations this year, as fewer sport fishers were able to come due to pandemic restrictions. This means the recreational fleet is expected to catch 15,000 less salmon than was forecasted for this year, according to figures provided by the department.

None of this surplus is going to the First Nations.

""As per approved management plans, the Area G (commercial) harvest is adjusted based on the projected recreational harvests which results in an increase of 15,000 for 2020,"" said department spokesperson Athina Vazeos.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan was unavailable for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Jennifer Kuss, noted the improvements made in giving the five nations a higher priority in the yearly salmon catch allocations, as directed by the courts.

""This change ensures that food, social, and ceremonial (fishing) continues to be prioritized first, and additionally prioritizes the Five Nations rights-based sale fishery over the recreational and commercial fishery,"" Kuss said in a statement.

The Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations argue Ottawa could have provided some of the unused catch from this year to their people to help them support their remote communities. But Atleo said fisheries officials would not even engage in discussions about it.

""The government is trying to say they consult with us, they negotiate with us. They create their fishing plans, put it on the table and it's like take or leave it,"" Atleo said.

""All we want to do is be part of the economy, part of looking after ourselves without depending on government. We don't think that's a lot to ask.""

NDP MP Gord Johns, whose riding takes in the West Coast fishing shores, said he finds it ""disgusting"" the Trudeau government has repeatedly highlighted its desire to restore the Crown's relationship with Indigenous Peoples but has still fought many legal battles with these nations over their fishing rights.

""Indigenous people in our communities rely on this fishery for their economy, for their food security, for their culture. It's part of their way of life. These are salt water people and they rely on the salmon and to be denied their right is shameful, it's disgusting that the government is taking this approach.""

The First Nations are calling on Ottawa to revisit its decision on the surplus salmon for this year to allow them a portion of the additional catch.

""The government has an opportunity to fix this with these (surplus salmon) to come with a fair opportunity to exercise their commitment, in the judge's words, for a generous allocation to the nations and to start moving forward with reconciliation,"" Johns said.

The minister's spokeswoman says Jordan takes any allegations of systemic racism ""very seriously"" and that Ottawa is working with the five nations on a reconciliation agreement on fisheries resources, which is intended to broaden their access in the area, Kuss said.

""The road to reconciliation is a long journey, and Canada is committed to moving forward together. The department has spoken with the five nations on the reallocation of (salmon catch) on multiple occasions and that open dialogue will continue.""

The BC Wildfire Service said crews are responding to the fire on Christie Mountain about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, on the east side of Skaha Lake.

The fire is estimated at 250 hectares and firefighters on the ground are being supported by air tankers.

The service said the situation was ""rapidly evolving"" and asked everyone to stay clear of the area to avoid interfering with the operation.

The order asks residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with pets and critical items.

""We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,"" the service said in a tweet.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a ""fire of note"" on Tuesday.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was smouldering with no open flame but was considered out of control. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight.

Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Firefighters have tackled dozens of wildfires after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions.

Two fires were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

""It was nice to get on the board tonight,"" said O'Reilly.

""I haven't been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it's just one game. I've got to be consistent with it.""

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

""When we take care of the puck it's effective and it's hard on them,"" said O'Reilly.

""I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We've got to stick to our structure.""

Pietrangelo said they've been working on fixing the penalty kill.

""We've been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,"" he said.

""Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.""

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

""They're blocking a lot of shots, they're studying us. They kind of know what we're doing,"" said Miller.

He said they'll make adjustments but aren't going to go back to square one.

""We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,"" he said.

""It's not like we're getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They're a good team. We're a good team. It's going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.""

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O'Reilly, last year's Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play — the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O'Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O'Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler's stick and in.

O'Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

All Western Conference games are being played in front of no fans at Rogers Place. The players are being kept isolated in a so-called bubble between games to prevent contracting COVID-19.

It was the spring of 2010 and Clune, who had made his NHL debut earlier that season, was finally on the road to getting the help the 23-year-old knew he needed in his crippling addiction battle.

article continues below

With his younger brother, Matt, at the wheel, they drove through upstate New York in a torrential downpour home to Toronto. Clune wasn't sure he was going to make it.

""I was in the acute withdrawal phase,"" he said in a recent interview with The Canadian Press. ""I couldn't sit still for a second. The most logical thing at that point in time for me was to go jump off a bridge ... literally.

""I couldn't really see myself coming out of it.""

But come out of it he did, and a decade later, Clune is sharing his story in ""Hi, My Name is Dicky,"" a raw documentary available on iTunes and AppleTV that details his life from aspiring youth hockey player to out-of-control junior antagonist to pro athlete teetering on the edge — one consumed by drugs, alcohol and mental illness.

His journey to recovery started in earnest on that lonely stretch of highway.

""My brother really had to talk me off the ledge,"" Clune said. ""When I see his face and when I see my other brother Ben's face, that's what gave me strength to live, because I didn't really want to live for myself at that time.

""Matt, at a couple points on that drive, had to do things that no younger brother should have to do and really dig down deep and get me home.""

The documentary from Taylor Prestidge and Haris Usanovic of Upper Canada Films tracks Clune's life and career, recovery and redemption. It includes interviews with Clune's parents, brothers, teammates and coaches.

Clune was driven to be the best as a child, but the pressure led him down a dark path at early age.

""I made that decision I was going to put my head down and not see anything but being a hockey player,"" Clune, who was selected in the third round of the 2005 NHL draft by the Dallas Stars, says in the film.

He began to try alcohol in his early teens as a way to cope, and it escalated quickly once he got to high school and then the Ontario Hockey League.

""I had this hole inside me that made me insecure and afraid of the world,"" Clune recounts. ""I got wasted and was like, 'Wow. OK. I'll be able to do this. I can cope with this. It's like a warm blanket.'

""Alcohol saved me. It was my solution to that problem of being self-absorbed and focused on all the things that made me insecure and self-conscious and in pain and sad.""

But he didn't realize how much of a spiral his life was taking. In junior, he would drive from bar to bar, party to party, drinking, smoking marjiuana and doing cocaine.

""I wanted to walk that line of looking death in the face every day, but still play hockey and do all these things,"" Clune says in the film. ""I don't know how I did it.""

Things got worse after junior when he was living in the United States by himself before making his NHL debut in that fateful 2009-10 season, months before becoming completely unglued.

""I had achieved my goal,"" he recalls on screen. ""But I hated myself.""

Clune eventually checked into rehab a second time — he went once before, but didn't stay — and committed to getting better with a lot of help from the people around him.

After he got out, he resumed his career and went onto play a total of 120 regular-season games in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Nashville Predators. His contract was bought out in 2015, and he was again at a crossroads — retire or keep going.

That's when the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were in the early stages of their massive rebuild, came calling to see if Clune wanted to be part of their program. They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club. At the very least, he would play in the minors and help foster a new culture.

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, who was in charge of the minor-league Marlies at the time, saw something in Clune that could be useful.

""He provides a certain energy,"" Dubas said. ""He provides experience in his life that I thought brought a great spirit to our team.""

Clune played 19 games with Leafs, but the forward truly made his mark with the Marlies. He helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018 and plans to continue his on-ice career, but equally important was how he's helped mentor a number of current NHLers.

He's proud of where he is, and not shy talking about how he got there. Clune still goes to meetings, does the 12 steps and now works to help others.

He also thinks a lot about why he made the decision to live, to fight, and get better, when many others — including some fellow pro hockey players — have gone down a different path.

""In the beginning, it was because I wanted to see my brothers,"" said Clune, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Then it transformed into wanting to live for myself. I started to discover what it feels like to have self esteem and to have love.

""I just hope people realize that they're not alone with how they feel. Don't be afraid to ask for help.""

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

""After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,"" Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal's three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first overall by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

""A low-maintenance superstar,"" said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg's senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At five foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn't blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack of getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday. ""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League. I think it was Dale's arrival that really cemented the future of the franchise and I think we all have recollections of that first year, that Calder (Trophy) year and then everything that would follow.

""He was truly a superstar as a hockey player, but I think why he was so loved here was not just that but largely the fact that he made this his home and became one of us. I think everybody shared that sense of pride in Dale's career as a player.""

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: ""All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL's all time greatest players.""

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

""What an incredible human being,"" Selanne tweeted.

Montreal Canadiens associate coach Kirk Muller also had a chance to speak with Hawerchuk in recent days.

""I talked to Dale a few days ago, and we had a good chance to chat. A good friend, had a real good opportunity to play against one of the all-time best players. As a hockey player, we all know how great he was, but he was a good friend and just a really special person, did a lot for charities. It's a real loss for us in the hockey world.""

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk ""one of the most decorated players in our game's history.""

In September 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

""For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I'm ready to fight it,"" he told TSN in October 2019. ""I want to live to tell the story.""

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie's bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames players Andrew Mangiapane and Rasmus Andersson remembered playing for Hawerchuk in Barrie.

""I don't know where I'd be without him,"" said Mangiapane. ""Very sad news today. I owe my career basically to him and the whole Barrie organization.""

Andersson, from Sweden, said ""Dale was a fantastic human being. Such a great person. My first week in Barrie he invited us over to his house and really just welcomed me to Canada. I cannot say enough good things about him as a person. Obviously a real good coach, too.""

""It's awful news.""

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday's opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at age two and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur's record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

""I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive — well maybe a little further now with the traffic,"" he said. ""I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""

""I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,"" he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and '81 with teammates that included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL's top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt like he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year — the youngest recipient at the time — and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

""Just one of the greatest. You could tell from day one. We knew from when he was 18 years old as a player that he would turn the (Jets) franchise around. Certainly one of the best I’ve ever played with and coached,"" said Dallas Stars coach Rick Bowness, who played with and coached Hawerchuk in the '80s.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

""He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,"" said Mike Doran, Winnipeg's director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the faceoff in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux's famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

""It turned out fantastic,"" said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada's call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets ""are etched in my mind every day that I live.""

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes' ring of honour.

Hawerchuk re-wrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia whom he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

""It's like going back down memory lane,"" he said in his induction speech.

""All the experiences have been fantastic,"" he added. ""I mean, sometimes they didn't feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing ... Even though I didn't win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn't change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.""

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets' Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November 2017.

""Tonight we fly Ducky's number high,"" said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue's ""Home Sweet Home,"" before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

""Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,"" said the PA announcer.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

""I've been to every part of (Manitoba), either golfing or playing (softball),"" Hawerchuk said. ""I've gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I'm honoured and I'm very humbled.""

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.

While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season.

And that includes how to allow players under contract to CFL teams the ability to sign elsewhere — most notably the NFL — if the opportunity arises. On Monday, the CFL cancelled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The focus right now for us on a few certain things and one of them is ensuring if there's an ability for our players to receive some form of payment this year,"" Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA's executive director, said Monday during a conference call. ""They should be able to do that if they have an opportunity.""

While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season. However, 66 players have currently opted out of participating in the 2020 campaign, which could create opportunity for some CFL players to sign deals south of the border and have a chance to earn a football paycheque, either on the active roster or on the practice squad.

While there's no shortage of collegiate players available, the advantage a CFL player has is pro experience, a fact not lost upon NFL personnel people.

The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign. This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.

And players on NFL practice rosters receive at least US$8,000 per week.

Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the CFL is amendable to doing what it can to help its players.

""Where we can do something we will,"" he said. ""We're going to be committed to working towards good outcomes, the best possible outcomes we can have with out players.

""That's not going to mean we're going to be able to do everything but we're certainly going to go into this with a real positive spirit.""

Something else that will be on the CFL-CFLPA radar will be the current collective bargaining agreement, which is slated to expire after the 2021 season. But union president Solomon Elimimian said the two sides covered a lot of ground this time around during talks to amend the agreement for a shortened '20 season.

""Whether we deal with '21 when it comes or after the '21 season I think there's hope there that we can work together,"" Elimimian said. ""Obviously the relationship between the players and the league needs to be one where the players feel appreciated.

""Everyone wants to the league to reach its full potential. The partnership has to be one that's very genuine and the players have to feel part of that. If that happens, the sky is the limit.""

Cavan Biggio also went deep for the Blue Jays and finished with three hits and three RBIs.

Ryu (2-1) struck out three and walked none. The left-hander permitted only one runner past second base and yielded just one extra-base hit to a team that came in ranked second in the majors with a .467 slugging percentage.

Rather than vie for strikeouts, Ryu said he was focused more on getting the Orioles to hit the ball weakly.

""I was able to keep them off balance,"" he said through an interpreter.

Signed in December to an $80 million, four-year contract, Ryu got off to a shaky start with Toronto in July before showing the form he displayed as a star with the Dodgers. He's given up a total of two runs in his last three starts after allowing eight runs over nine innings in his first two outings.

""That was vintage Ryu,"" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. ""Ryu was outstanding. That's the reason we won the game.""

The two home runs were a factor, but mostly Ryu was the difference-maker.

""They didn’t give Ryu that big contract for nothing,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""You just never know what he’s going to throw. You don’t know what side of the plate he’s going to throw to. He’s really tough on right-handers because he can locate it in. You saw a lot of us get jammed.""

The Blue Jays took control with a four-run third against Alex Cobb (1-2). Three infield hits produced a run before Grichuk delivered a three-run drive over the centre-field wall. It was his third home run of the season, all in the last four games.

""Obviously, the pitch to Grichuk was middle middle and it was a poorly executed pitch,"" Cobb said. ""But most of the pitches that I had, I felt like I executed. I got the results.""

Cobb gave up five runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He’s winless in his last four starts.

After hitting 31 homers last year, Grichuk was batting fifth, sixth or seventh in the order this season before Montoyo decided to move him into the No. 2 spot Sunday to replace injured Bo Bichette. Over the past two games, Grichuk has two homers, four hits and six RBIs.

Pedro Severino and Renato Núñez had RBIs for the Orioles, who have dropped two straight after winning seven of eight.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Bichette (right knee sprain) had an MRI and will receive a second opinion on his injury, Montoyo said. Bichette leads Toronto with a .361 batting average.

Orioles: RH Dillon Tate (elbow contusion) came off the injured list and RH Evan Phillips was optioned to the team's alternate site.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: RH Nate Pearson (0-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his fourth start in his first big league season Tuesday night. Drafted 28th overall in 2017, the 23-year-old is looking to rebound after giving up four runs to Miami last week in 2 1/3 innings. ""I'm developing at the highest level,"" Pearson said Monday. ""When I don't have my best stuff, I'm going to struggle.""

Orioles: LH Wade LeBlanc (1-0, 7.13) has allowed a combined 10 runs over 12 innings in his last three starts.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

""We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,"" Marchand said. ""That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.""

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

""We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do — little battles,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.""

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President's Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk's first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy's hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina's captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy putaway from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston's first six post-season games.

""There's other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.""

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen's late goal.

""That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,"" Williams said. ""We got it handed to us.""

NOTES: David Pastrnak had a goal and an assist in Boston’s double-overtime win in Game 1, but hasn’t played since. He had 48 regular-season goals to tie Washington’s Alex Ovechkin for the league lead. … Carolina played without 20-year-old Andrei Svechnikov, who was injured when his leg twisted awkwardly beneath him late in the third period of Saturday's loss. ... DeBrusk scored his 12th and 13th playoff goals since his 2018 post-season debut. … The Hurricanes were also without D Joel Edmundson for the third straight game. … Jake Gardiner assisted on Williams’ first-period goal for his first post-season point with Carolina.

""It shouldn't impact the credit score, but it should show up on the credit report.""

The Canadian Bankers Association said that as of June 30, 760,000 account holders had negotiated mortgage deferrals or skipped payments, while 445,000 had requested deferral for credit card debt.

According to Equifax, deferred payments — many agreed to as part of COVID-19 relief programs — don't harm borrowers' credit scores. But the payments must be reported in a certain way, and the status of these payments may not get reported to Equifax for up to 30 days.

It's important to make sure these deferred payments are reported correctly to credit bureaus, because even one false late payment can drop a credit score by as much as 150 points, says Wong. Credit scores are used not only by lenders, but also checked by cellphone carriers, employers and landlords, Wong says. Because it takes time to correct a credit score error, waiting until you ""need"" your high credit score is a risky move, she says.

""Depending on the type of error, the longer it persists, the more negative the impact,"" says Wong. ""If it's showing up as a late payment and it goes to month two, then it's two months of missed payments as opposed to just one. So I would encourage people to check their credit report and make sure that everything on there looks right.""

Anne Arbour, a financial educator at the Credit Counselling Society in Toronto, says that Canada's two credit-reporting agencies, Equifax Canada and TransUnion Canada, are data aggregators, and it is up to the lenders to create policies on how they report the deferred payments. It's important for consumers to get clear documentation of their agreement with their lender — such as a bank — when it comes to how they are reporting deferred payments, she says.

""Get as much detail from the lender, from the creditor, as possible about what a deferral will mean and what their practices as far as reporting it — so, whether it will impact somebody's rating or their score or not,"" says Arbour. ""And if there is any issue or concern, deal with the creditor first, getting as much written information as possible.""

Arbour noted that deferrals are not an automatic license to skip payments — not only must a formal agreement be struck, but many lenders may have explicit instructions on how interest or even late fees accrues while payments are halted.

Taylor Little, chief of Vancouver-based alternative lender, Neighbourhood Holdings, says that many people skipped payments based on reading about deferral programs, without actually checking to make sure whether the lender was offering deferrals or some other type of payment plan instead. Doing that can hurt a credit score, and likely won't be counted as an error, he says.

When checking with lenders, Arbour says people should collect a copy of the agreement, a file ID or reference number, and the name of the agent with whom they spoke, in case this information is needed to file a credit score dispute down the road.

If a consumer notices something that might be wrong on their credit score —such as a deferred payment being counted as ""late"" — the lender is once again the first stop, she says.

""Going back to the creditor themselves is a good first step,"" she says. ""[Equifax and TransUnion] have worked closely with the Canadian Bankers Association, with the lenders, everybody to try and come up with a way to report any deferrals, whether it was mortgages or credit cards, in a way that wouldn't penalize the consumer. But the onus ultimately was on and is on the creditors to change their systems.""

In addition to requesting a fix from the lender, consumers can ask Equifax or TransUnion to investigate a mismarked payment, through a credit report update form or investigation request form. Separately, consumers can also now put a ""consumer statement"" to a credit report to signal to lenders that something is being disputed. Equifax Canada gives an example: ""Be advised that the negative accounts on my credit report are related to the Covid-19 pandemic. I intend to make these up as soon as I can find a job.""

Keeping on top of errors — and being quick to correct them if they happen — is easier if consumers stick with a routine and understand the parts of the credit scoring process, says Arbour. For example, free services that offer credit monitoring offer more frequent updates and are different from Equifax or TransUnion's free yearly reports. Those annual reports from Equifax or TransUnion are also different from the formal scores checked by lenders in a ""hard"" credit check, she says.

She advised that consumers can take advantage of both credit monitoring services and free yearly reports.

""There's no sort of one size fits all answer — very often mortgages don't actually appear on credit reports,"" says Arbour. ""[Mismarked deferrals] haven't been brought up as a concern just yet. . . . I think come September, it might be a different story. Once deferrals are over, unless people are checking their credit report, they won't notice it unless they're in a situation where they're having to renew their term or renegotiate a rate or a debt management program.""

P.K.

There are several sure indicators of the seeds being ready for harvesting. First, the plump, upright seed capsules should be fully dry. Holes should have opened up immediately below the neat little disk that tops the capsule. The final sign is a free rattling of the seeds within the capsule when it is shaken gently.

I harvest the capsules by cutting them off carefully and depositing them into a paper bag, which I then store in a dry, dark, cool place until I’m ready to extract the seeds. This is done by upending each capsule and shaking it, as you would a salt shaker, over a clean, dry container.

Dear Helen: What were the rusty markings on my garlic plants? The bulbs themselves seem all right, though they are smaller than those I harvested last year. I did not compost the tarnished tops.

B.D.

Cool, wet weather through early July made our garlic plantings (and many other plants) highly vulnerable to an array of diseases. One of them is garlic rust, a fungus that causes rusty orange specks on the foliage. Upon digging the bulbs, you made the right choice to destroy the infected leaves.

Effects of the disease on the harvested bulbs are minimal. They should store well. The infection can reduce the bulb size, but this year’s home garden bulbs have generally been smaller than the supersized bulbs many of us harvested last year.

Watch for rust on other onion family plants in the garden. Leeks and chives are examples. Get rid of any infected plants by late autumn, before they can transfer disease spores to any extra-early green garlic shoots, which sometimes appear early in the winter.

Another key disease prevention measure is to wait four years before planting garlic or any other onion family plant in a space. Dormant disease spores eventually die in the absence of a host.

Every year, in late summer, I make a rough sketch of the vegetable garden with all the major plant types positioned on it. I keep them on a clipboard for easy access to individual planting sites over recent years. Those pages are a helpful guide to keeping plantings moved carefully around from year to year.

Dear Helen: For two years now, paper wasps have built nests in my greenhouse. They are not at all aggressive and their small nests are interesting. Are they native insects, and beneficial?

W.S.

That depends on the kind of paper wasp you have. The European paper wasp is considered invasive, and damaging to fruit and berry crops. It builds small, papery, umbrella-shaped nests on eaves, porch ceilings and similar locations as well as in trees and shrubs. These insects have black and yellow stripes similar to yellow jacket wasps, but the bodies are more elongated with a narrow, pinched-in waist.

Native paper wasps are more golden in colour, with more elongated, thinner waists. They are considered beneficial as pollinators and pest predators.

You will find descriptions and colour photos of European and native paper wasps, and of yellow jackets, at beefriendly.ca/paper-wasp-nests/. The nests of all three are also pictured.

Dear Helen: Why did all the early flowers on my strong and healthy heirloom tomato plants dry up without any fruit forming?

A.M.

Tomatoes and other warmth-loving plants did not fare well in the unusually cool and wet, almost fall-like late spring and early summer weather this year. I’ve heard from many gardeners whose melon plants expired in the daunting conditions, which also made successful pollination of tomato flowers more than challenging.

Many, but not all, heirloom tomato varieties need a long season of sun and warmth to yield a successful crop. And they demand near perfect conditions for a good fruit set.

Having said that, I should note that my heirloom Japanese Black Trifele tomato plants developed fruit from the very first blossoms, low down on the plants. Those first fruits ripened a week ago. This variety is an unusually easy-growing, prolific producer of tomatoes with a rich flavour.

Your tomatoes most likely began forming fruit with the arrival of warm weather, but because of the late start some of our plants may prove disappointing this summer."

It's an opportune time for an update to this lavishly illustrated history of gardening and landscaping. ""The Story of Gardening"" might sit (heavily) on a coffee table, but it transports the reader out into the yard or the park with some new perspectives and ambitions.

article continues below

We all appreciate green space more than ever these days. As always, gardens offer the promise of beauty, serenity, artistry and practicality. They're also a relatively safe place to spend time, and gardening as a pursuit has taken off in the age of coronavirus.

""We can picture the garden-owner gradually beginning to derive pride, status and pleasure from the plot that it was within his power to make fertile and beautiful,"" write the authors, Penelope Hobhouse and Ambra Edwards, imagining humankind’s very first gardens. They could just as well be describing many people this summer.

The authors show gardening to be an age-old struggle to appreciate and amplify nature’s beauty while also imposing order on it. It’s about finding a balance, too, between what looks good and what is practical.

""The Story of Gardening"" begins in the Fertile Crescent and travels around the world and up to the present. For those of us wondering what to do with our yards and gardens next year, there might be inspiration in seeing how different cultures have approached layout and plantings, from Islamic walled gardens to the ""power-gardening"" formalism of French royalty to the more naturalistic English cottage gardens to pared-down Japanese gardens and more.

The American idea of the endless front lawn, one rolling into another, was an attempt to democratize the landscape, doing away with the walls and formal plantings of colonial estates, the authors say.

A new final chapter includes recent projects, including New York City’s High Line and Piet Oudolf’s sweeping meadows of grasses and perennials, and focuses on sustainability, ecology and other gardening concerns today.

There will be flowers to cut, fruits to gather and savour, process and store away. Though its fresh, spring-like youth has passed by, the garden’s “middle age” and maturing cycle brings its own rewards.

We could say of the garden what Keith Richards (of the Rolling Stones) proclaimed in a documentary on his life: “I’m not aging. I’m evolving.”

As the garden evolves into its late summer season and beyond, it yields gifts of sun-ripened tomatoes and cucumbers, squashes, leeks and kale, brilliant hydrangeas, fragrant lilies, and full-headed sunflowers.

As I walk through the August garden, Robert Browning’s poem Rabbi Ben Ezra comes to mind:

“Grow old along with me!

The best is yet to be,

The last of life, for which the first was made”

All the planning and preparation, seeding and transplanting done early in a gardening season is rewarded later with many pleasures as the garden “evolves.” It’s a time for me to revisit longtime favourite dishes that bring back old memories as they deliver fine summer flavours.

There’s a broad bean salad in a lemon juice, olive oil, garlic and salt dressing, with cooked broad beans joined by sweet red pepper, onion, chopped raw zucchini and feta cheese.

With the first sun-warmed, ripe tomatoes I anticipate a garlic and basil flavoured, uncooked tomato sauce over hot spaghetti, dusted with freshly grated parmesan cheese.

Every summer, zucchini are transformed into a tart with onion, eggs and cream in a recipe I learned to make in Italy. And during a year I spent in a tiny Greek village I observed what was called a “Middle Eastern” salad being made with cucumber chopped into a yoghurt mixture.

First, yoghurt was placed in a bowl and drizzled with a little olive oil. Fresh lemon juice was added next, along with salt and a generous amount of mashed garlic. Finally, the cucumber. What a wonderfully tangy way to enjoy the summer’s cucumbers. My daughter often mentions how she loved it as a child.

This poppy is called Black Swan Lace.

Perpetual poppies. It was a warm weekend morning late last month when two neighbours rang the doorbell and asked to walk through the garden. Karen, on a week’s leave from coast guard duty, had not yet been through the garden this summer.

They sampled raspberries and gathered a few broad beans, which they had never eaten, to try, but Karen was clearly most drawn to the big poppy seed heads. She is fond of the seeds as toppings for bagels and as ingredients in muffins and breads. Most of the peony-flowered poppies (Papaver somniferum) had dropped their petals and were in the process of ripening the black seeds that are used in baking.

These poppies, both single and double flowered, commonly appear in gardens, and self-sow to return each year. A double-flowered pink bloom is common, as is a pale mauve form with deep rosy purple blotches. Every year seems to bring its own assortment of colours. This year, several peach-coloured poppies flowered in the garden.

Every few years I add to the gene pool by choosing and seeding a new variety. This year, I grew Black Swan Lace, an unusual fine-petalled flower in deep burgundy-black. The seed was from Brother Nature Seeds in Victoria.

Tanya’s berry parfait. When I invited a neighbour to have dinner with me late in July, she volunteered to bring dessert. What she created was a visual and flavour-filled seasonal delight.

Tanya brought individual, layered desserts, in glasses. Over a thin layer of graham cracker crumbs was a blend of yoghurt thickened with a little cream cheese, sweetened with maple syrup and flavoured with lemon juice and zest.

The next layer was blueberry sauce, also sweetened with maple syrup and flavoured with lemon. Tanya thickened the sauce with cornstarch (dissolved in a little water).

The sauce was covered with more of the yogurt mixture topped with a dusting of graham cracker crumbs and garnished with fresh berries. The individual desserts had been chilled in the fridge for about two hours.

Tanya and I share a preference for minimally sweet desserts. This dessert is light, fresh and versatile. It can be made using any garden fruit or berry, fresh or in sauce form."

R.M.

article continues below

Fragrance will vary with the weather, the age of the blooms and the time of day. I often sniff-test the petunias on my patio. I grow the most fragrant ones I know of, and place them by the screened patio door that I open on summer mornings and evenings. They are at their most fragrant in warmth, and the fully opened flowers are more perfumed that newly opened and fading ones.

Dear Helen: How can I tell whether the raspberries in the garden of a house I bought are summer-bearing or “everbearing”?

K.P.

Several of my neighbours have recently asked me the same question. Gardeners often pass along raspberry canes to friends without informing them about the variety. “Summer bearing” raspberries have one harvest season, in July. The berries are borne on canes that developed in the previous year. Canes that have finished producing berries are cut down to allow the new canes that will bear the next year’s crop to mature well. Crowded canes are thinned out.

Everbearing raspberries give an early summer crop and another in late summer to early autumn. They will have wound up their first harvesting period now, and will have begun developing flower buds at the tips of this year’s new canes for the second crop.

That’s how you can identify the two-crop “ever-bearers.” Flower buds begin developing on the new canes in late July and early August.

Managing ever-bearers: Cut down the old, browning canes that produced the early summer berries. When the late-season crop on the new canes has been harvested, cut those canes back to just below the tops that produced berries. Next year’s early raspberries will be produced on the cane portions below where you have cut.

Many people simply cut down all the everbearing canes at winter’s end. That eliminates the early summer berries. New canes that grow in the spring will give only the one, late-season crop.

I don’t do that because I prize the early summer berries and the late-season crop often coincides with early autumn rains that turn the berries mouldy.

Dear Helen: I would like to try growing winter vegetables this year. I’m not sure what I can start from seed or transplants at this time. Are transplants widely available?

G.W.

You will find some winter vegetable transplants at most garden centres. They usually begin arriving in late July or early August. A few phone calls to your favourite local outlets should unearth sources.

You will find transplants of cold-hardy lettuces, kale, winter cabbage, and over-wintering cauliflower and sprouting broccoli. Seeds can be planted outdoors now of spinach, winter lettuces, arugula, mizuna (a spicy Asian green with feathery leaves) and corn salad.

Dear Helen: This is going to seem crazy, but as I was digging over a previously uncultivated patch of ground last month, I heard a distinct hissing sound coming from the soil. A bit of poking around unearthed a large beetle with lines on its back. More hissing emanated from the beetle. Have you ever heard of anything like this?

A.D.

Over the years, I have dug up many beetles similar to the one you describe, in varying stages of their maturity. The creature is a tenlined June beetle. The adult beetles usually emerge from the soil in June to mate and lay eggs. The cold weather delayed most of the emergence until July this year. Not long ago I dug up several that were just on the verge of taking flight — the precise stage at which they seem to make that odd bellows-like wheezing sound when disturbed.

Favoured egg-laying places are in the roots of grasses. The eggs hatch to produce plump, C-shaped larvae that live in the soil for three to four years before reaching the adult stage. They are found in the greatest numbers where lawns and grassy fields have been dug up to plant gardens. Then, they can cause some damage to plant roots and potato tubers.

I watch for the whitish, curved grubs and remove them as I dig plots. Turning over the soil a few times before planting helps to expose larvae that you miss to birds and other predators."

As a property owner and council member, you have the legislated obligation under the Strata Property Act to maintain and repair common property and common assets. Your owners also approved a budget including landscaping services, which is also a lawful instruction to implement the contracts wherever possible. Regardless of the size or type of a strata corporation, annual operations plans are the best method to ensure the obligations of inspection, maintenance and repairs are implemented. An operations plan will summarize the components and assets of your strata corporation, which can easily be converted from your deprecation report, and identify what level of service or inspection and maintenance are required as part of your annual operations, and what components or systems are managed on a long-term basis.

If your strata corporation fails to maintain common property and common assets, and an owner suffers a loss, the owner is likely in a position to seek damages against the strata corporation either through the courts or the civil resolution tribunal. If you have failures relating to building systems or assets that result in insurance claims, your insurance provider is likely going to advise you of this risk, put you on notice of increased costs for claims or advise you of their inability to renew your insurance. Common areas of neglect for strata corporations are drainage and sanitary systems, roofing systems and electrical systems. Most items that are out of sight are often not a priority, but these key components often result in avoidable claims and damages, and a significant disruption to owners. Sanitary lines and drains for example, should be flushed professionally at least every three years if not more frequently. Likely due to the increased occupancy periods this year with the pandemic restrictions, there has also been an increase in sewer backups, but the most common attributable factor is simply aging building systems that are neglected.

Sewer backup is one of the most severe problems, and accessing buildings during the lock down is a greater problem, as the plumbing contractor will require access to strata lots as well.

General inspection and maintenance of operational building components is the best method to prevent losses, claims, unnecessary damages and, in many cases, often extend the life of building components. Roofing systems cover 100% of our investments, yet most property owners undertake inspection or maintenance on an annual basis. A qualified inspector or roofer can identify deficiencies and damages that can be easily and quickly addressed to ensure good performance of the roofing system and extend the life of the roofing system if routine service is conducted.

Routine maintenance of hot-water boilers will extend the life of the boilers and ensure they are performing at their best efficiency levels reducing energy consumption and cost. If your roof fails, this is now an emergency repair. Damages have been caused, the cost for after hours response is significant and the repair is short term rather than a co-ordinated approach to maintenance and renewals. The attitude of waiting until a component fails before we have to fix it is a false economy.

Create a schedule of all your building components and determine what services you require and the frequency of servicing. For more information on operations plans and samples, go to choa.bc.ca and view the webinar on operations plans.

She has decided to travel the world, or at least parts of it, and has changed her living requirements at home. Lucky me. But not sure how to make the turquoise chair work with my rather bland decorating.

Lucky you is right. Furnishings and accessories that we inherit don’t always suit our style. But sometimes they teach us something about ourselves that we might not have known.

Instead of thinking about how the turquoise chair doesn’t work, ask yourself if you like it. That’s the key. If so, experiment with ways that it could fit.

It is natural for most of us to be timid about colour. Especially strong colour. That chair demands to be noticed. Just like a red dress or bright yellow shirt says here I am, look at me. There is nothing wrong with strutting your colour. And it can be done in such a way as to not overwhelm you or your space.

That red dress would be more flattering with a pastel pink scarf to soften the effect. What about white pants with the yellow blouse? And for your chair, in a cheerful and stylish bedroom, pale tones of buttery yellow on the walls and cool shades of green on the bed soften and balance the strength of the turquoise as shown here from thespruce.com.

Decorate around a bold colour with neutrals taking most of the wall space. The bedlinens are also neutral, but the glorious turquoise pops up as part of the design on the curtains and a throw cushion.

Until you are used to the chair, drape a light yellow or green blanket over the back. Or add a cushion. Enjoy your inheritance. I bet it will soon be your favourite piece.

Dear Debbie: I am a bit of a hoarder, not crazy yet but I do have difficulty finding ways to make my rooms look reasonably neat. My partner has just moved in and I feel a crisis coming on. How do I manage the mess?

Choose a bookcase that will enhance your room as well as the items you have selected to display.

You know what I’m going to say: To begin with, do a purge. Painful at first but once you take a good look at what you are saving you will discover that you just don’t need or want all that stuff. And what a perfect way to welcome your partner.

Next is to create places for storing and viewing what you really do care for. A good set of shelves, one for each room, will get you started. Group together collections that tell your story like the pieces you have saved for a reason. Whether it’s books, miniature cars, old perfume bottles or postcards, display them so you can enjoy the memories.

If it’s something larger like posters, paper a wall with them. Is it shoes? Line them up along the bedroom wall. I’ve never understood the need to hide away what we hold dear no matter what it is. Then ask your partner to do the same.

Choose shelving that enhances your stories. Floating shelves promote an airy feeling, good for a minimalist vibe. Wooden shelves with wrought iron brackets are country style. Built-in bookshelves garner a more formal façade offering a feeling of permanence. Next pick a colour to paint the shelves if they aren’t already finished.

They have refused to grant permission for the removal of a section of wall between the units, even though we have obtained a structural engineering report and a building permit for the work. The wall is not structural and does not contain any services, such as plumbing or venting, that could affect our two units or another strata lot.

This was a significant investment intended to raise our family in an affordable setting and has turned into a disaster. Are there some options to force the strata council to co-operate with our request and resolve this?

Maria and George C., Vancouver

Strata corporations are naturally reluctant to allow the removal of walls between units or above and below units.

There are many buyers who try to flip units quickly by doing quick-fix alterations and changes. Then the next buyer comes along and discovers there are problems with mechanical services, the walls were, in fact, structural and supporting, the ventilation has significantly changed or the plumbing — water delivery or drainage — has been altered.

Both the new owner and the strata corporation are often left with damages and liability to remedy the unauthorized alterations.

Owners who want to remove all or part of a wall that is a common boundary between two strata lots require the written approval of the strata corporation.

Provided the owner complies with building regulations and any applicable municipal or regional bylaws, and does not interfere with the provision of utilities or other services to any other strata lot or common property, and provides copies of any required building permits to the strata corporation, the strata corporation must grant the permission.

Documents and plans certified by an engineer that verify the scope of the work in detail, address building-code requirements, and include the required building permits would be a minimal standard for a strata council to request.

If the strata council does not act reasonably, Strata Property Act provisions can be enforced with an application through the Civil Resolution Tribunal.

It would be beneficial to request a hearing with the strata council, which can be conducted electronically. You may wish to retain a lawyer to be present at your hearing to determine what conditions, if any, are not being met, or if the strata is simply refusing to comply with the act.

The unit entitlement or size of the two strata lots remains the same, as well as the voting rights of one vote per strata lot. There is no increase in strata fees, as the habitable area of each strata lot has not been changed. As the owner, you continue to pay the same strata fee entitlement for the two strata lots.

Any other changes within the strata lot, such as removal of a kitchen or update or remodelling of bathrooms or internal walls and rooms, all require the permission of the strata corporation. Detailed drawings and plans should be provided to help the strata council make a decision.

Changes to electrical systems, plumbing and ventilation can also have a significant effect on the use and enjoyment of other strata lots.

During the COVID-19 restrictions, many strata corporations are encouraging owners to delay alterations to strata lots to reduce construction activity within their buildings and reduce the transiency of contractors and trades.

The level of caution your strata council is exercising is prudent; however, under normal conditions, they do have an obligation to grant permission within a timely manner.

That’s been a common issue this year. One of my neighbours pulled up and composted all her cauliflower plants because the heads had taken on purplish tones. Too bad, because they were perfectly safe to eat.

Cauliflower is highly heat-sensitive. Most plants thrived in our long, cool, moist spring and early summer, but the sudden onset of heat and strong sunlight has caused in some plants the common reaction of purple colouring.

Certain varieties, such as the popular Snow Crown, are more susceptible than others. I’ve had Snow Crown heads become tinged with purple or purplish-pink in hot, sunny weather.

Dear Helen: I was interested in your descriptions of dense, close-space planting to make the best use of a limited area. I have experimented with planting like this and found watering can be challenging. The dense foliage canopy of substantial plants such as tomatoes, broccoli and pea vines tends to divert water away from the plants’ roots. How do you manage to keep the root areas of closely spaced plants moist?

A.T.

Soaker hoses laid between the rows is one way to keep the sheltered soil watered. I use a more hands-on method.

To reach in and give a gentle but thorough dousing of the soil between two four-metre pea vine rows and between a pea row and another of staked tomatoes, with just a one-metre space between the rows, I’ve used a long-handled watering wand with an on-off lever.

That first pea planting is finished and removed now and I’m picking the second planting, but the narrow alley between the peas and tomatoes is easily kept well moistened, at ground level, with my handy extra-long watering wand.

To some, such a method might seem antiquated and inefficient, yet the time spent wielding that wand is somehow easeful.

I treasure such blessedly undemanding tasks. They are sublime opportunities let the gaze wander, listen to the bees humming, and rest the mind.

Dear Helen: Quite a few years ago, you shared a recipe for lavender cookies. I used that recipe so much, my copy has become unreadable. Could you repeat it? I love these cookies and they are a favourite of my family and friends.

T.W.

Lavender shortbread

1 1/2 cups butter at room temperature

2/3 cup sugar

2 Tbsp chopped lavender florets

1 Tbsp chopped fresh mint

2 1/3 cups flour

1/2 cup corn starch

1/4 tsp salt

Cream butter and sugar. Add lavender and mint. Mix until light and fluffy, about three minutes. Add flour, corn starch and salt. Beat until combined.

Divide the dough in half, flatten into squares, and wrap in plastic. Chill until firm. On a floured board, roll or pat out each square to a thickness of 3/8 inch. Cut the dough into 1 1/2-inch squares or rounds, and transfer to baking sheets that are covered with parchment or brown paper. Space them one inch apart, and prick each cookie several times with the tines of a fork.

Bake 20 to 25 minutes at 325 F, until pale golden. Do not allow the shortbread to brown.

Cool slightly, transfer to a rack, sprinkle with lavender powdered sugar if you wish, and store in sealed containers.

Lavender powdered sugar is made by putting a few lavender flowers in a sealed pint jar of powdered sugar for a day before using the sugar.

The standard rose campion species is a familiar plant with dense clumps of velvety, silver-grey foliage and multi-branched stems bearing bright magenta-pink blooms. Like most species, L. coronaria doesn’t always produce flowers in a common, uniform colour. Seed growers over the years have selected certain variations and propagated them to produce a distinct strain.

Most of the flowers on my self-sown boulevard plants this year are white, some with vestiges of the pink blushing characteristic of my original Angel’s Blush seeding. One plant bears the usual deep magenta pink blooms of the species.

One man stopped his truck beside the boulevard and asked permission to photograph the white-flowered rose campion for his mother, a keen gardener. They’d never seen rose campion with white blooms.

The British company Chiltern Seeds lists the species, along with Angel’s Blush and Alba — the white-flowering form. J.L. Hudson (California) also lists Alba, as White Campion. Angel’s Blush is sometimes named L. coronaria Oculata.

Most mainstream catalogues no longer list this historic Mediterranean flower. Two more sources are Brother Nature Seeds in Victoria and Florabunda Seeds in Ontario.

Abundance. Until almost mid-month, cool temperatures and frequent rains created waves of lush green in our gardens. Everything grew profusely. I’ve never had such plump, juicy lettuces. The frilly endive has been flavourful, with no bitterness.

Potato tops grew uncommonly long. Spinach and beet greens were luxuriant. Cabbage family vegetables grew wonderfully robust in the cool weather. And the peas have been magic.

My first double row of peas, seeded mid-March, produced a mass of pods on thick-stemmed vines. A first picking, on July 1, yielded seven cups of blanched peas for the freezer. After a series of follow-up pickings I had frozen 25 cups of the peas. That did not include the ones I’d consumed fresh.

Now those vines are lifted, chopped and composted, and the second double, four-metre row has begun to yield filled pods. That first double row grew, like the second one, on wire fencing in a space one by four metres. The same space delivered around 10 lettuces that developed from transplants placed along the pea vine bases. That’s a fairly substantial yield of food from the limited space.

Along the south side of the same rectangular plot, another four-metre length of wire fencing supports a dozen staked tomato plants and two cucumber vines, with sweet potatoes growing in a strip on the south side of the tomatoes.

That space, four by 1.2 metres, promises a good yield of food if the weather warms sufficiently.

Delayed development. While cool growing plants flourished through late spring and early summer, others did not. Fruit set has been delayed on open garden tomatoes. Two of my three Sugar Baby watermelon transplants shivered into oblivion. The one remaining began expanding earlier in the month atop a partially “finished” compost heap, but it might be too late now for fruit set and ripening.

With warm, sunny weather, tomatoes should begin to develop fruits more normally, but varieties requiring a long, warm summer to ripen may prove disappointing this year. My Big Beef, Arbason and Japanese Trifele Black plants have swelling fruit.

There are plenty of small tomatoes on the potted patio varieties, though the plants have grown larger than they usually do. Fruits are developing on the potted miniature peppers.

The regular, full-sized cucumber plants have struggled, and bear only tiny fruits, but the two mini-cucumber varieties I’m growing have been more than gratifying.

I ate my first 13-centimetre cucumber from a Picolino (West Coast Seeds) vine on July 13 and the first from Green Light (T&T Seeds) the next day. The trained (upward) Green Light vines are as tall as I am. The vines are robust, with large, deep green leaves.

My friends had been raving about the greenhouse-grown mini-cucumbers sold at our local farmers’ market. Their comments prompted me to grow my own."

Want to take a peek into homes where plants rule? It’s a mindset that Hilton Carter, passionate lover of all things green and author of Wild Interiors, Beautiful Plants in Beautiful Spaces, CICO Books 2020, explores and practises on a daily basis.

After surveying restaurants, hotels, and public spaces as well as the countless homes he has visited and styled, Carter notes that “filling spaces where people gather with greenery has become a new way of life. To so many of us, the need to surround ourselves with plants is just that: life.”

article continues below

As Carter takes us on a journey through 12 very special plant-lovers’ homes, he offers styling tips.

Artist Alina Fassakhova has amassed 80 plants that happily grow in clusters throughout her loft apartment. In part they act as living screens demarcating spaces in an open plan design.

Shown here, Philodendron and Alocasia separate Alina’s kitchen from the rest of the space making the transition feel natural and not blocking out light as a screen would do.

It’s not easy for her to pick a favourite plant, but Alina does choose the variegated Monstera because every leaf has a unique, abstract pattern.

Carter has laced his book with valuable information on a wide variety of plants including plant descriptions and instructions on light requirements, temperature, watering and repotting. There’s even a section on trending plants.

In Antwerp, Belgium, when plant store owners Sofie and Yannick renovated a townhouse built in 1905, they had two things in mind, “finding more space for our cats and plants and finding new ways to integrate plants into different rooms and lighting conditions.

In the room that opens out to a patio they built a beam and added a skylight so they could hang plants and a hanging chair.

Carter calls this a plant throne, a place to sit and survey all the beautiful greenery in your kingdom.

Prominent plants in this photo are Monstera deliciosa, rubber plant and fiddle-leaf fig.

The jungle vibe is all around but balanced in rooms where smaller plants sit on side tables.

Carter has a few words for pets vs plants.

Acknowledging that plants can be toxic to pets he suggests hanging climbing or trailing plants up high, grouping small plants along a window sill leaving no room for jumping felines, and choosing larger tree-like plants that have tall trunks, which keeps the foliage out of reach.

Plants require the right “outfits” to sit in. Another point of style for Carter is how the plants are presented.

Choose a selection of pots and hangers that suit the size and growth patterns of your plants.

In Sara’s duplex cottage in L.A., her living room has an intriguing display of plants.

A fiddle-leaf fig, a bird of paradise, sword fern and golden pothos thrive in comely pots and a large open weave basket.

Carter offers a guide for plant selection according to the available light in each room as well as which plants suit specific rooms.

Understand your light and space requirements before you bring home these new friends.

It is a great source of happiness tending to the plants and watching them thrive under your care.

When they first came here from Edmonton five years ago, Barbara Girard and Axel Meisen bought a three-storey house in the Oak Bay enclave.

article continues below

“We had wanted a bungalow, but our choice was very slim at that time,” said Barbara, adding the house was far too big. “I soon learned that everything I wanted was always on another floor.”

So they were delighted when the realtor who’d sold it to them called to say he had another buyer who’d seen the place when it was up for sale and desperately wanted it. Were they interested in selling?

“But we’ve just unpacked,” Barbara cried when she heard the news. The determined realtor swiftly rephrased the question: “How much will it take?”

A deal was struck and the couple set about finding the home they really wanted.

They found it five doors down — a 1953 rancher with almost 3,000 square feet on one level.

They took it down to the studs and created a home with much larger windows, fewer walls, a 900-square-foot deck and a totally reimagined garden.

It was designed by architect Shauna Makin and built by contractor Nick Kerridge of Re-design Services.

“They are very, very efficient,” said Barbara, noting the company only does one project at a time, giving it complete focus.

The rebuild ended up costing at least 25 per cent less than building new, said the owners, who have lived and worked in three countries and five provinces, and previously built a home from the ground up.

They both delight in the light that suffuses their new home.

It’s one of the things they love most, thanks to the massive windows that replaced the 1950s-style hip-height ones and the east-facing back of the house, now drenched in light every morning.

“It was a major transformation,” said Axel. “And it was very gratifying that we were able to transform not just a house, but a house from the 1950s, into a house for the 21st century.

It also meets their requirements for “very active aging in place,” said the chemical engineer, a former dean of Applied Sciences at UBC, which included the schools of engineering and architecture.

He and Barbara spent time looking at everything from task lighting to walk-in curb-less showers, non-slip tiles, eliminating tripping hazards and creating extra-wide doorways.

“We know our trajectory here,” said Barbara with a smile. “We know where we’re going.”

Interior demolition and renovation began in 2017 and took five months, after which the owners moved back in while the exterior was updated. Landscaping with more than 500 new trees and shrubs came last, all conceived by Barbara.

They installed a high-efficiency HVAC system that provides both heat and air conditioning. Eco-conscious elements in the home include finishes with low off-gassing, natural materials, water-sparing faucets, low-flush toilets, LED lights and on-demand hot water.

The interior design was inspired by a Ted Godwin painting that hangs on a feature wall between the kitchen and living room.

Waterscapes by Godwin, who was known to paint as if he were standing mid-river, are seen throughout the home. His liquid artworks led to their choice of soft blues, greys, pale yellow and a few splashes of red.

“We wanted a peaceful, harmonious, tranquil environment with flexible living space, lots of big window and natural materials,” said Barbara.

All the wood is Canadian, with cherry cabinets, blond maple flooring and many furniture pieces made in the Scandinavian style by an artist in Newfoundland.

The rooms are larger than normal, especially since the couple combined three bedrooms and a hallway at the rear of the house to make one long living room edged in windows opening onto the vast deck.

The former living room is now their master bedroom, and it’s so large that they created a huge storage closet on one side to hold things like luggage, in addition to an ensuite and generous closets.

Two rooms at the back of the garage were transformed into offices. Each has a Murphy bed and loads of storage, and the two are connected by pocket doors, to create either two guest rooms or one large one.

The roomy kitchen was previously four smaller rooms, including a galley kitchen, bathroom, laundry and pantry.

The couple lived in Vancouver for 30 years while Axel, who was born in Hamburg, was at UBC. He was then asked to take over as president and vice-chancellor of Memorial University in Newfoundland, and was later invited to become chair of foresight with the Alberta Research Council. The Order of Canada holder has continued to be a strategic advisor to numerous groups, including the Universidad de Piura in Peru, which recently gave him a second of his honorary doctorates.

Montreal-born Barbara, who was project manager for their home rebuild, is a strategic planner and change-management expert who created her own company. She works in both private and public sectors, loves music and joined the board of the Victoria Children’s Choir after moving here. She previously was vice-chair of the Shallaway Youth choir in Newfoundland, which now has 450 choristers.

Axel calls the new home their “condo in a garden,” and the two say they are enjoying the environment here immensely.

They see Victoria today as the way Vancouver was 40 years ago.

“But I’m not too happy when I predict that Victoria will be a lot like Vancouver in 20 years,” said Axel.

“We have an opportunity to do something different here, to maintain the special quality of Victoria and Vancouver Island,” said Barbara, adding they love Vancouver and spend quite a bit of time there.

“But we chose to be here because it’s smaller, easier to get around, more eco-friendly and there is a better quality of life.”"

We obtained the disclosure forms in advance, read the minutes and bylaws closely, and were aware in advance the insurance was increasing by 250% due to the location and type of construction of the building.

article continues below

We just received notice of the Annual General Meeting (AGM) to be held electronically in August, and other than routine business, the annual budget is increasing by 27% to address a deficit from the previous year and the significant increase in insurance.

What we find alarming is that the strata fees for September, if approved, include the increase from May to August as the fiscal year for the strata corporation ends April 30.

We did not find the increase unreasonable, because the fees appear artificially low, the 27% increase for the first four months is due and payable all at once in September adding $486 to a monthly fee of $607.

The back charge for the first four months is being called a retroactive fee. Why do we have to pay for a period of fees when we were not the owners?

Is the retroactive fee enforceable?

— Lillian & Dave M.

There have been several Civil Resolution Tribunal decisions on this issue that originally deemed the status of retroactive fees was unenforceable. However, the B.C. Supreme Court has “disagreed” with the tribunal’s conclusions and upheld the practice in the matter of fiscal year strata fees involving a “commercial strata development.”

The dispute primarily focused on the interpretation of the Strata Property Act and whether a strata corporation who was charging the additional increase of fees for the period of the fiscal year that had already passed, was compliant with the legislation.

In the court’s view, there was nothing in the strata corporation’s approach to strata fees that placed it offside the act. A subsequent “adjustment” to the fees paid in the period between the end of a fiscal year and the passing of the budget for the next fiscal year, is not a retroactive charge.

The tribunal based its determination in large part of the notion that the strata fee information required to be disclosed in a Form B or Form F would be inaccurate if a prospective purchaser of a strata unit obtained those forms (a Form F remains “current” for a period of 60 days after it is issued) prior to the approval of a new budget. The buyer would be led to believe that the seller’s strata fee payment obligation was up to date when in fact it was not.

With the greatest of respect to the tribunal, the judge disagreed. An owner’s strata fee obligation does not arise until it is approved at the AGM. The Form F (and indeed the Form B) will have been accurate when issued. There is no requirement in the Act that strata fees be paid in equal installments.

Plainly, the schedule of strata fee payments can require equal monthly installments, or installments that include adjustments to make up a deficit between what was paid and what would have been paid had the budget for the current fiscal year been in place at the commencement of the current fiscal year.

Fees for one month may be different than for other months. Ultimately, the budget approved for the fiscal year becomes the obligation of the strata corporation to collect that amount through a schedule of fees due monthly as adjusted; however, not every strata corporation collects fees monthly or on the same schedule. Always read the bylaws of a strata corporation, especially resort properties if you are concerned about the payment of strata fee.

Many strata corporations hold their AGM after the fiscal year end as they wait for the completed financial reports to determine budgetary needs for the following year.

The AGM must be held within two months of the fiscal year end, unless there is an emergency order as we are currently under, which extends the period to four months.

If the AGM is held prior to the end of the fiscal year, financial projection statements must be prepared and circulated to the owners in advance of the AGM as well as a completed financial report within eight weeks of the end of the fiscal year. While it is advantageous to convene the AGM as early as possible to execute the next year’s budget, the total amount owing by each strata lot for that fiscal year is the same total whether you approve the budget before the fiscal year end or after.

When the strata corporation issues notice of the meeting, the fee schedule required by the Act showing either an adjustment in the next month or over the balance of the year is included, which by default is ratified by the owners when they approve the annual budget by majority vote.

Your “volunteer” plant is Nicandra physalodes, commonly known as shoo-fly plant but also called “Apple of Peru.” It’s a vigorously bushy annual, 60 to 150 cm tall depending on the growing conditions, with handsome, wavy-edged leaves and summer-long sky-blue, bell-shaped flowers followed by attractive, papery pods that are used in dried arrangements.

Native to Peru, Nicandra is an old-fashioned garden favourite, grown for its decorative qualities and also for its possible fly-repelling qualities. It used to be grown commonly around farm homes for that purpose, and in greenhouses to help control whiteflies.

I acquired seed years ago, and the plants have made a modest return appearance every year since. From its popularity in years past, Nicandra has become modestly naturalized.

Currently, few catalogues list the seeds. One that does is Brother Nature Seeds, located in Victoria. Their listing of Nicandra suggests a possible reason for the plant’s fly-repelling reputation: “We believe the pods, when dry, resemble small hornets’ nests.”

The J. L. Hudson catalogue, a source for many unique and unusual vegetable and flower varieties, lists the regular Nicandra as well as ‘Nigra,” a form with deep purple-black stems and pods flushed with purple. I’ve seen that variation from time to time in my self-sown plants.

Seeds for a Nicandra with variegated leaves used to be available. I’ve grown that one too, but I don’t see it listed in any of my sources now.

Dear Helen: My three-year old Eucryphia tree is shedding leaves. They turn orange and drop off. Is this normal? — M.N.

The young tree in your photo looks healthy. It is normal for a broadleaf evergreen to shed up to a third of its leaves at a time. That’s the way the plants keep themselves renewed.

My long-established Eucryphia tree is sprinkled only sparingly with orange-brown leaves that the tree will discard, but I notice that a star jasmine (Trachelospermum jasminoides) is dotted far more thickly than usual at this time of year with orange leaves, just like your Eucryphia.

This evergreen leaf shedding is commonly most pronounced in late autumn through early spring. I’m thinking that the oddly cool temperatures through June and early July may have triggered an unseasonal discolouring and shedding of leaves. On many of those days I heard people commenting that the weather felt distinctly fall-like.

Eucryphia is a broadly columnar tree with white flowers in late summer. To grow and flower well it needs a neutral to slightly acidic soil that is kept consistently moist but drains efficiently of excess moisture.

For good flowering, the body of the tree needs to be in sun, while the roots are in shade. My own tree illustrated that need when, for years, it grew well but never flowered — until a neighbour removed a coniferous evergreen grown to giant size next to a nearby side fence. The exposure to sunlight that followed brought on a flush of lovely blooms.

Dear Helen: The tomatoes in my greenhouse already are distorted by monkey face. What can I do? I don’t want to lose the crop.

G.P.

I suspect you are referring to a deformity in the fruit known as catfacing, a physiological disorder causing puckered surfaces and bands of scarring across the far (blossom) ends of the tomatoes. It is caused by stressful growing conditions that interfere with good pollination and fruit development.

In unheated greenhouses this spring and early summer, the cause of the catfacing was probably the abnormally cool weather interspersed with a few sunny, warm days. This would have caused stressfully wide temperature fluctuations between day and night temperatures.

In the outdoor garden, flying insects and breezes usually take care of pollination, other conditions being congenial. In a greenhouse, the necessary shifting of pollen in the flowers can be accomplished by a gentle shaking of the plants late in the morning, when any dews have evaporated and the pollen is sure to be dry.

As the weather settles into a more summer-like pattern, fruit development will very likely normalize. But as temperatures rise, be aware that extremely hot temperatures in a greenhouse can cause enough sterilization of the pollen to also cause catfacing. The pollen can become sterile at around 32 C. Ensure enough ventilation to moderate the temperature."

I’m thinking of a lacy wild arugula plant at an edge of a vegetable plot this spring, a dainty ruff of white sweet alyssum blooming around its base. Both plants self-sow freely in my garden.

Several years ago a donkey-tail spurge appeared beside the greenhouse door. I cut back the flowered stems in summer to retain the evergreen plant’s neat form as its blue-green, succulent foliage peeks out of a companion (volunteer) carpet of bigroot geranium.

To keep that plant duet conveniently compact, I occasionally pluck out tufts of the geranium and pass them along to a neighbour who is establishing a mass planting of the weed-suppressing ground cover.

And the tall, flamboyant peony poppies are back in abundance this year — in beautiful coral and peach shades, white and pink, lilac, and one with finely fringed, burgundy-black petals. Most have fully double, frilly flowers. The smooth, blue-green leaves have wavy edges.

These poppies (Papaver somniferum) are welcome points of dramatic colour throughout the garden, and the dried pods yield seeds that can be used in baking. For that reason they are called breadseed poppies. The plants are frequent “volunteers” in gardens.

Early in the month, beside the cucumber vines, I found a lovely lilac poppy blooming together with the lacy flowers of cilantro. For a while I stationed myself in front of the bloom, watching a bee darting in and out of it. As I stood there, a hummingbird arrived to whir away at my right elbow for a while before darting off.

Gardens. Places to pause, and allow delight to happen.

July pruning. I aim to prune wisteria, kiwi and grape vines, and fruit trees this month. Summer pruning of fruit trees helps to keep them compact, while “dormant season” pruning in late winter promotes an abundance of new growth.

On my apple trees, I shorten the new growth back by at least a half, often leaving just three or four leaves on that new, lighter-coloured growth. Cut right above an outward-pointing leaf, to direct new growth away from the centre of the plant.

At the same time, remove any dead, broken or awkwardly positioned growth. Ideal is an uncongested tree that allows free circulation of fresh air and optimum exposure of ripening fruit to sunlight.

Shorten new growth also on kiwi and grape vines. I make the cuts just a few leaves beyond forming fruit. On both vines, opening up “windows” of sunlight onto the developing kiwi fruit and grape clusters helps to promote their development and ripening.

On wisteria, shorten the long shoots of new growth to between 10 and 15 cm. Cut main, framework stems back where they have grown beyond the vine’s support structure. Prune again in January, leaving three or four buds on shoots produced since the summer pruning.

Cats, revisited, with bells on. In a recent column I shared my adventures chasing neghbours’ cats away to protect quail families making their way through the garden. The last time I ran after beefy Blaze as he headed for his home fence, I rounded a corner too fast, slid on a rock pathway edging, and toppled over onto a large, cushy clump of chives. I was fine. The chives, not so much.

It appears I’m not alone in attempting to foil the felines. Jean has written: “We have also had a problem with cats. We used to see the quail all the time and now never do. The neighbours’ cats do have bells, but they (the cats) soon learned to walk in a way that keeps the bells silent.”

Another reader admits to “having a serial killer of a cat.”

In search of a solution, she “talked to the staff at Wild Birds Unlimited, who advised me that birds are highly colour sensitive. On their recommendation my cat now wears a very bright fabric clown-style ruff. Now, she is catching one bird a month at most, compared to one almost every day.”"

At our annual general meeting last week, all the votes had been pre-counted and when it came to the election of council there were no additional nominees permitted and the council were simply announced as elected based on the restricted proxies that were issued. We were basically observers at the meeting. Is an electronic meeting really any different than a meeting with in-person attendance?

Margo W. Richmond

An electronic meeting is a fully constituted meeting like an in-person meeting. All the provisions of the bylaws and the Act must still be followed.

The only difference is the address, which is the electronic address and the method of electronic attendance that requires everyone to be able to communicate with each other. The obligation for eligible voters to register and be issued a voting card is still a requirement. Eligible voters may be identified at point of registration, or a ballot showing their strata lot number can be sent with the notice package, which they can use to identify their strata lot and used for voting during the meeting. If an owner cannot attend the meeting, it is the owner’s privilege to decide whether to assign their proxy to a person who can attend electronically, or to a council member in attendance.

A restricted proxy is only a privilege of the strata owner, this is not a function the strata corporation can impose on owners.

The Strata Property Act permits proxies, subject to any limitations or restrictions imposed by owners. By issuing a restricted proxy the owner can confirm their voting instructions or limitations are restricted to what was instructed. The person who is appointed on that proxy must be present at the meeting for the proxy votes to be counted at their instructions.

Proxy votes, or a restricted proxy is not an absentee ballot. It must still be exercised at the time the votes are taken, which may be after each resolution or a designated voting window at the end of the resolutions and elections. At this time every eligible voter, including the assigned proxies submit their votes either in a ballot method, by email, a verbal call of the roll, an electronic poll or some other method determined in the bylaws of the strata.

Secret ballots are a bit more complicated to manage as the only method the strata has to verify if an eligible voter has submitted a ballot is to be able to identify the person who voted or submitted the votes.

While an email ballot is secret from the remainder of the owners at the meeting, the scrutineers who are receiving the balloting instructions must be able to identify the source of the vote. At an in-person meeting, secret ballots can be easily managed as a sequential audited paper ballot may be used to ensure the vote count can be audited and compared to the registration without identifying the voters.

While this may seem a bit excessive at times, strata corporations are frequently required to approve millions of dollars of special levies, expenses, or bylaws that often result in serious limitations to use of property.

A helpful solution to prepare for the registration and voting is to develop an instruction page to explain the voting procedures that is included with the notice package. This is both helpful for the owners to understand how they will be voting and the property manager and chairperson to administer the voting procedures.

Several strata corporations are including a voting card showing the strata plan number and the strata lot number with the notice package. This makes the electronic meetings much easier to conduct registration and identify voters and the chairperson can still call for a show of voting cards.

The real challenges, of course, are to manage 200 participants electronically. While a traditional two-hour meeting is easily taking four-plus hours, there is a much greater participation by owners with the convenience of electronic meetings

The latest price list from research firm Random Lengths released Thursday shows SPF (spruce, pine, fir) two-by-four boards at a ""mindboggling"" record level of US$760 per thousand board feet, up $82 on the week, according to Kevin Mason, managing director of ERA Forest Products Research.

""You've got buyers who care more about just getting product than they do about the price,"" he said in an interview.

""The companies have purchase orders sitting on the desk and it's, like, when you get product, send it to us, and just tell us what we owe you. Buyers don't care. Right now, it's an absolute panic, a scramble to get product.""

The run-up over the past several weeks has demolished the previous North American record high of US$650 set in mid-2018, he said, adding prices for other building products are rising just as quickly.

Homebuilders say increases this year to date will translate into $8,000 to $10,000 more to build a typical single-family house in Canada.

Jayman Built Homes will have to consider passing on its higher costs to customers when lumber supply contracts expire at the end of August, said president and chief operating officer Dave Desormeaux.

""Most builders, I believe, would just pass it on and increase the price of a home for the cost of the materials,"" he said, adding his firm, which plans to build about 700 homes this year in Edmonton and Calgary, has the capacity to absorb short-term commodity fluctuations.

""Right now we're not affected but, come Sept. 1, when we're building houses, it's going to be a huge increase for us because we've eaten it (higher prices) along the way.""

But Bobby Richardson, whose Woodlands Mountain Homes builds five or so custom homes per year in Bow River Valley communities west of Calgary, says he has no choice but to pass his higher costs on to current customers.

The rise in demand comes from increased interest in renovations by people working from home during the pandemic, said Mason, along with a strong housing market in Canada and the U.S. fuelled by people's renewed appreciation of having their own homes and aided by extremely low interest rates.

Supply, meanwhile, has fallen as several mills in British Columbia were closed over the past year due to a shortage of wood fibre after a mountain pine beetle infestation and recent wildfires. Those mills aren't likely to reopen soon, he said.

Many North American mills curtailed production temporarily earlier this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

Lumber production was about 1.6 billion board feet lower in April and May compared to the same months in 2019, said analyst Paul Quinn of RBC Dominion Securities in a report. That's equivalent to removing about 4.5 per cent of total 2019 production in North America.

""We expect that actual demand was higher than production in both April and May due to strong R&R (renovation) demand, which resulted in distributors drawing down inventory levels,"" he said, adding the tight market could persist even though most curtailed mills have returned to production by the end of June.

""With new residential construction returning with a vengeance in June-July, we expect that even normal supplies would be wholly inadequate to meet demand.""

Canadian lumber production declined by 18.9 per cent in May, he said, with B.C. production down 26.2 per cent year-over-year to 677 million board feet. In the U.S., production fell by 6.8 per cent.

In a research report, CIBC analysts point out that current lumber prices are just two per cent less than the all-time peak in November 1996 when the price for two-by-fours hit US$480 (or US$775 in today's dollars after adjusting for inflation).

Canadian lumber producers coming off better-than-expected second quarter financial reports are making gains on the commodity price rally as investors flock to snap up their shares.

On Friday, West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd., Interfor Corp. and Canfor Corp. all rose to new 52-week high stock prices on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

The new program, based in part on feedback from thousands of consumers, ""is more important than ever as airlines compete to earn and retain customer loyalty in a rapidly changing environment,"" CEO Calin Rovinescu said in a statement Tuesday.

Passenger revenues at the Montreal-based airline dropped by 95 per cent year over year in its second quarter, prompting 20,000 layoffs as the airline burned through $19 million of cash per day amid border closures and a collapse in demand stemming from the coronavirus.

Air Canada made last-minute tweaks to the rewards revamp in response to the outbreak, prioritizing partnerships with the Uber Eats app and other companies yet to be announced, said Mark Nasr, head of loyalty and e-commerce at the company.

""We did a lot of soul-searching as COVID-19 developed,"" Nasr said. ""We really accelerated these 'every day' partnerships.""

The points that members earn on purchases via eligible retail, hotel and credit card partners will count toward to the tally required to reach the lowest rung of ""elite status"" — 25,000 kilometres of air travel in a year.

For example, an Uber Eats purchase of $50 would yield 100 points for Aeroplan members, and another 50 to 75 points if it was made through a TD Aeroplan Visa card.

Frequent travellers in one of Aeroplan's five elite categories will be able to share benefits such as lounge access and priority boarding with friends and family, even if they are not flying together.

Current Aeroplan members will keep their account numbers and Aeroplan miles will be converted to points on a one-for-one basis, Air Canada said.

The new system will base the number of points earned for a given flight on airfare rather than distance, which currently provides the baseline. That means the points gap between a flight to Asia and a flight across the country will likely narrow, since the difference in distance is often greater than the difference in price.

Meanwhile the new, more flexible pricing model — Air Canada has posted a ""points predictor"" tool on its website — also means more popular routes and times will cost more points than under the current fixed system, while off-peak times and less popular routes will be cheaper, said National Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen.

""We see this as margin-enhancing for Air Canada as it will be able to effectively charge market prices for rewards seats for more popular flights. In addition, it will allow the airline to enhance load factors on less popular flights,"" Doerksen said in a research note.

A flight between Toronto and Vancouver will cost between 25,000 and 35,000 points, according to the points predictor.

The renewed focus on consumer spending — TD announced Tuesday a ""refreshed suite"" of Aeroplan Visa credit cards, set to launch Nov. 8 — expands the loyalty program's potential appeal well beyond the jet set.

""The cards are what drives massive amounts of value. If Bob or Betty don't travel much by air, they can still have a TD or a CIBC or Amex credit card and they can make points on the program,"" said Robert Kokonis, president of Toronto-based consulting firm AirTrav Inc.

""There's all that day-to-day household spending that you can put onto the card that really generates points for the member and through to the bottom line of Aeroplan and then Air Canada.""

The added incentive to plastic comes as a welcome change for Air Canada credit card partners Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Visa and American Express.

Air Canada has said credit card penetration for so-called elite flyers is only 38 per cent versus about 50 per cent for most U.S. airlines.

TD and CIBC paid a total of $1.2 billion to help offset the hefty points liability, acquisition price and other working capital and pension assumptions for Air Canada.

Alonso crashed in Turn 4 when his Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet dipped onto the concrete portion of the apron at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and sent the Spaniard into the retaining wall. His damaged car rolled onto pit lane for an early end to his afternoon.

Alonso was sixth on the speed chart when he crashed. He ended up ninth for the day.

""It is just the way it is,"" Alonso said. ""Fortunately it happened today and not on (race day). We will learn from this. Nothing we can do now and tomorrow we start again.""

Alonso is making his third attempt to win the final leg of motorsports' version of the Triple Crown. The two-time Formula One champion has victories in the Monaco Grand Prix and 24 Hours of Le Mans, with Indianapolis the only race missing from the trifecta.

He had a strong car in 2017 when he raced at Indianapolis for Andretti Autorsport but an engine failure ended his shot at victory. Alonso failed to qualify for the Indy 500 last year in an effort from McLaren.

He also crashed during Indy 500 practice last year and it contributed to the many setbacks the McLaren team had during its preparations. The McLaren backup car was not the proper shade of orange and Alonso lost valuable practice time as the colour was corrected.

Alonso's crash with just over 50 minutes remaining in Thursday's session was the first wreck since the track opened Wednesday for practice.

Meanwhile, five-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon topped the speed charts at the end of the day with a lap at 226.102 mph for Chip Ganassi Racing. He was followed by Takuma Sato at 225.693 and Marco Andretti at 225.249 mph as Honda's took the top three spots.

Conor Daly at 225.106 was fourth and the fastest Chevrolet.

James Hinchcliffe of Oakville, Ont., was 17th and Dalton Kellett of Stouffville, Ont., was 28th.

There is one more day of practice before qualifying, called ""Fast Friday"" as IndyCar gives teams a horsepower boost to increase speeds. Defending race winner Simon Pagenaud said Team Penske had a deliberate plan to work on handling Thursday and will worry about speed during Fast Friday practice.

""I have no interest in drafting and getting a big number out there,"" Pagenaud said. ""There's no interest for me to do that. I know I can win this race and I know what I need. That's more important than drafting and putting up a big number."""

Cole Pearn abruptly retired at the end of last year's NASCAR season after helping build one of the best teams in stock car racing. His life on the road cost him too much time with his young family and relocating from Colorado to North Carolina had limited their access to outdoor adventures.

They returned to his native Canada to operate Golden Alpine Holidays in British Columbia, a venture that has been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. Racing has also been scrambled, and when the Indianapolis 500 was moved from May to Aug. 23, one of the Ed Carpenter Racing engineers had a conflict.

It created an opening at Carpenter on Conor Daly's car. One of Carpenter's crew members had worked with Pearn before and the connection was made: Pearn, the crew chief of Martin Truex Jr.'s 2017 NASCAR championship season, would work the Indianapolis 500.

""They asked. It was like, ‘Yeah, why not?’"" said Pearn, who called the Indy 500 a bucket list event. ""It's hard when you race your whole life and just completely turn it all off. So it's kind of nice to scratch that itch at the same time.""

Daly, in his first day working with Pearn, was ninth fastest around Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The Chevrolet was even faster Thursday, when Daly briefly sat atop the speed chart before Takuma Sato bumped him down a spot. He ended the day fourth overall in speed.

""We made some really good changes overnight and Cole has an idea of what he wants to do. He's got an interesting way of working, he's like ‘Yep, I know exactly what I want to do,’"" Daly said. ""I really like communicating with him and I think we are vibing really well.""

Daly, making his seventh Indy 500 start, finished a career-best 10th in his hometown race last season while running for Andretti Autosport. A scrapper who has pieced together a full IndyCar season swapping between Carpenter for oval races and Carlin Racing for street and road course events, the 28-year-old Daly is trying to stabilize his career.

Daly will try to parlay a strong 500 into full-time work while relying on a part-time engineer in the 37-year-old Pearn.

""I’ve learned to just try to get along with everyone,"" Daly said. ""I’m a very trusting individual. Obviously, Cole has an incredible amount of experience in the racing world. Was a driver himself, as well. He knows what’s going on.""

Pearn's most noted success is in stock cars and a five-year stint as Truex's crew chief that produced 24 Cup Series victories. The team raced for the title three consecutive years, finishing second in back-to-back seasons after the 2017 championship.

Things began to change when Furniture Row Racing closed at the end of the 2018 season and Pearn and Truex were pulled into Joe Gibbs Racing. They won seven races and were runner-up to teammate Kyle Busch in the title race when Pearn decided he'd had enough.

He has since watched NASCAR on television and provides both insightful and comedic commentary on social media. Pearn recognized he missed racing.

""For sure missed the competition side,"" Pearn said. ""This is obviously a fully different experience, but racing is still racing. You throw a green and checkered.""

To prepare for Indy, Pearn took a very literal approach — ""I had to read the rule book,"" he said.

He's always followed IndyCar and his racing experience qualifies Pearn for the crossover that few expect will be a difficult transition.

""I grew up knowing these cars, it's not like it's anything crazy,"" Pearn said. ""In some regards it is kind of simple and it's just about understanding the procedures and how we set the cars up, learn how tech goes. The physics is honestly the easiest part, understanding how everything else works is the harder part.""

When Carpenter made the hire, he had no doubt bringing in Pearn would be seamless and give Daly a shot at winning the Indianapolis 500.

""I believe when you bring in smart and talented people that have a work ethic, they’re going to figure it out,"" Carpenter said. ""There’s a lot that’s different but a lot of the processes are the same. Some of the language is different. He’s definitely putting in the work to do it, getting prepared. A lot of what we’re doing at Indy is making decisions in the moment. I think we all feel like Cole has those traits."""

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

article continues below

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister.
""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.
""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.
MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.","OTTAWA — Chrystia Freeland shattered a glass ceiling Tuesday, becoming the first woman to be sworn in as Canada's finance minister.

The gravitas of the moment was not lost on the former journalist and mother of three. After she spoke the English words of her oath of office, she paused to take a deep breath, before repeating the oath in French.

article continues below

""It's about time,"" Freeland said later at a press conference on Parliament Hill.

She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.

Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.

But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.

""There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,"" said Turnbull. ""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.""

Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.

She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.

""We don't like their representative very much,"" he said of her in September 2018.

Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said ""Mama (does not equal) chopped liver."" On the back it said ""Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.""

When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.

And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.

""She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,"" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.

He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.

""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.

""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.

""I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,"" he said. ""And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.""

She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.

""What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,"" Kelly said on Twitter. ""This has been missing in the department for several years.""

MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.

While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.

Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.

Trudeau said Tuesday that she had been ""a key player in my government from day one.""

The five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations are upset that Ottawa decided to give a surplus allocation of salmon — which arose this year due to reduced recreational fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic — to commercial fishers rather than to the First Nations.

Clifford Atleo, lead negotiator for one of the nations who is also called Wickaninnish, says he feels sports and commercial troll fishers are given more rights to fish in the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

He says the latest decision to shut First Nations fishers out of an opportunity to catch more chinook salmon this year shows systemic racism is ""alive and well"" within the federal fisheries department.

""We feel very strongly we're not being dealt with fairly, we know we're not being dealt with fairly,"" Atleo said.

""It's just another layer of disappointment on the part of how the government deals with us. The government doesn't realize that their attitude toward our people is dyed-in-the-wool ... And I think the government — sometimes they don't realize they're being racist. They've got age-old policies that have never changed.""

A 2018 B.C. Supreme Court ruling directed Ottawa to take a more ""generous approach"" to allocations of chinook salmon to the First Nations given the importance of this species to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people.

The ruling from B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Humphries noted that the government's salmon allocation policy at the time gave recreational fisherman priority to fish for chinook and soho salmon ahead of the First Nations and advised the fisheries minister to reassess this policy.

Despite this ruling and changes that have since placed the First Nations at a higher priority than sport fishers, the Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ehattesaht and Mowachaht/Muchalaht nations say their yearly fishing allocations have not increased.

This year, the five First Nations were told they could fish 7,724 chinook, which amounts to just 1.5 fish per person for the 5,000 members of their communities.

COVID-19 brought a new dynamic to the salmon allocations this year, as fewer sport fishers were able to come due to pandemic restrictions. This means the recreational fleet is expected to catch 15,000 less salmon than was forecasted for this year, according to figures provided by the department.

None of this surplus is going to the First Nations.

""As per approved management plans, the Area G (commercial) harvest is adjusted based on the projected recreational harvests which results in an increase of 15,000 for 2020,"" said department spokesperson Athina Vazeos.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan was unavailable for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Jennifer Kuss, noted the improvements made in giving the five nations a higher priority in the yearly salmon catch allocations, as directed by the courts.

""This change ensures that food, social, and ceremonial (fishing) continues to be prioritized first, and additionally prioritizes the Five Nations rights-based sale fishery over the recreational and commercial fishery,"" Kuss said in a statement.

The Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations argue Ottawa could have provided some of the unused catch from this year to their people to help them support their remote communities. But Atleo said fisheries officials would not even engage in discussions about it.

""The government is trying to say they consult with us, they negotiate with us. They create their fishing plans, put it on the table and it's like take or leave it,"" Atleo said.

""All we want to do is be part of the economy, part of looking after ourselves without depending on government. We don't think that's a lot to ask.""

NDP MP Gord Johns, whose riding takes in the West Coast fishing shores, said he finds it ""disgusting"" the Trudeau government has repeatedly highlighted its desire to restore the Crown's relationship with Indigenous Peoples but has still fought many legal battles with these nations over their fishing rights.

""Indigenous people in our communities rely on this fishery for their economy, for their food security, for their culture. It's part of their way of life. These are salt water people and they rely on the salmon and to be denied their right is shameful, it's disgusting that the government is taking this approach.""

The First Nations are calling on Ottawa to revisit its decision on the surplus salmon for this year to allow them a portion of the additional catch.

""The government has an opportunity to fix this with these (surplus salmon) to come with a fair opportunity to exercise their commitment, in the judge's words, for a generous allocation to the nations and to start moving forward with reconciliation,"" Johns said.

The minister's spokeswoman says Jordan takes any allegations of systemic racism ""very seriously"" and that Ottawa is working with the five nations on a reconciliation agreement on fisheries resources, which is intended to broaden their access in the area, Kuss said.

""The road to reconciliation is a long journey, and Canada is committed to moving forward together. The department has spoken with the five nations on the reallocation of (salmon catch) on multiple occasions and that open dialogue will continue.""

The BC Wildfire Service said crews are responding to the fire on Christie Mountain about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, on the east side of Skaha Lake.

The fire is estimated at 250 hectares and firefighters on the ground are being supported by air tankers.

The service said the situation was ""rapidly evolving"" and asked everyone to stay clear of the area to avoid interfering with the operation.

The order asks residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with pets and critical items.

""We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,"" the service said in a tweet.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a ""fire of note"" on Tuesday.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was smouldering with no open flame but was considered out of control. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight.

Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Firefighters have tackled dozens of wildfires after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions.

Two fires were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

""It was nice to get on the board tonight,"" said O'Reilly.

""I haven't been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it's just one game. I've got to be consistent with it.""

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

""When we take care of the puck it's effective and it's hard on them,"" said O'Reilly.

""I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We've got to stick to our structure.""

Pietrangelo said they've been working on fixing the penalty kill.

""We've been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,"" he said.

""Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.""

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

""They're blocking a lot of shots, they're studying us. They kind of know what we're doing,"" said Miller.

He said they'll make adjustments but aren't going to go back to square one.

""We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,"" he said.

""It's not like we're getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They're a good team. We're a good team. It's going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.""

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O'Reilly, last year's Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play — the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O'Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O'Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler's stick and in.

O'Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

All Western Conference games are being played in front of no fans at Rogers Place. The players are being kept isolated in a so-called bubble between games to prevent contracting COVID-19.

They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club.","TORONTO — Richard Clune remembers the drive — the pain, the anxiety, the uncertainty, the fear.

It was the spring of 2010 and Clune, who had made his NHL debut earlier that season, was finally on the road to getting the help the 23-year-old knew he needed in his crippling addiction battle.

article continues below

With his younger brother, Matt, at the wheel, they drove through upstate New York in a torrential downpour home to Toronto. Clune wasn't sure he was going to make it.

""I was in the acute withdrawal phase,"" he said in a recent interview with The Canadian Press. ""I couldn't sit still for a second. The most logical thing at that point in time for me was to go jump off a bridge ... literally.

""I couldn't really see myself coming out of it.""

But come out of it he did, and a decade later, Clune is sharing his story in ""Hi, My Name is Dicky,"" a raw documentary available on iTunes and AppleTV that details his life from aspiring youth hockey player to out-of-control junior antagonist to pro athlete teetering on the edge — one consumed by drugs, alcohol and mental illness.

His journey to recovery started in earnest on that lonely stretch of highway.

""My brother really had to talk me off the ledge,"" Clune said. ""When I see his face and when I see my other brother Ben's face, that's what gave me strength to live, because I didn't really want to live for myself at that time.

""Matt, at a couple points on that drive, had to do things that no younger brother should have to do and really dig down deep and get me home.""

The documentary from Taylor Prestidge and Haris Usanovic of Upper Canada Films tracks Clune's life and career, recovery and redemption. It includes interviews with Clune's parents, brothers, teammates and coaches.

Clune was driven to be the best as a child, but the pressure led him down a dark path at early age.

""I made that decision I was going to put my head down and not see anything but being a hockey player,"" Clune, who was selected in the third round of the 2005 NHL draft by the Dallas Stars, says in the film.

He began to try alcohol in his early teens as a way to cope, and it escalated quickly once he got to high school and then the Ontario Hockey League.

""I had this hole inside me that made me insecure and afraid of the world,"" Clune recounts. ""I got wasted and was like, 'Wow. OK. I'll be able to do this. I can cope with this. It's like a warm blanket.'

""Alcohol saved me. It was my solution to that problem of being self-absorbed and focused on all the things that made me insecure and self-conscious and in pain and sad.""

But he didn't realize how much of a spiral his life was taking. In junior, he would drive from bar to bar, party to party, drinking, smoking marjiuana and doing cocaine.

""I wanted to walk that line of looking death in the face every day, but still play hockey and do all these things,"" Clune says in the film. ""I don't know how I did it.""

Things got worse after junior when he was living in the United States by himself before making his NHL debut in that fateful 2009-10 season, months before becoming completely unglued.

""I had achieved my goal,"" he recalls on screen. ""But I hated myself.""

Clune eventually checked into rehab a second time — he went once before, but didn't stay — and committed to getting better with a lot of help from the people around him.

After he got out, he resumed his career and went onto play a total of 120 regular-season games in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Nashville Predators. His contract was bought out in 2015, and he was again at a crossroads — retire or keep going.

That's when the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were in the early stages of their massive rebuild, came calling to see if Clune wanted to be part of their program. They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club. At the very least, he would play in the minors and help foster a new culture.

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, who was in charge of the minor-league Marlies at the time, saw something in Clune that could be useful.

""He provides a certain energy,"" Dubas said. ""He provides experience in his life that I thought brought a great spirit to our team.""

Clune played 19 games with Leafs, but the forward truly made his mark with the Marlies. He helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018 and plans to continue his on-ice career, but equally important was how he's helped mentor a number of current NHLers.

He's proud of where he is, and not shy talking about how he got there. Clune still goes to meetings, does the 12 steps and now works to help others.

He also thinks a lot about why he made the decision to live, to fight, and get better, when many others — including some fellow pro hockey players — have gone down a different path.

""In the beginning, it was because I wanted to see my brothers,"" said Clune, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Then it transformed into wanting to live for myself. I started to discover what it feels like to have self esteem and to have love.

""I just hope people realize that they're not alone with how they feel. Don't be afraid to ask for help.""

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

article continues below

""After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,"" Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal's three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first overall by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

""A low-maintenance superstar,"" said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg's senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At five foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn't blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack of getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday. ""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League. I think it was Dale's arrival that really cemented the future of the franchise and I think we all have recollections of that first year, that Calder (Trophy) year and then everything that would follow.

""He was truly a superstar as a hockey player, but I think why he was so loved here was not just that but largely the fact that he made this his home and became one of us. I think everybody shared that sense of pride in Dale's career as a player.""

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: ""All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL's all time greatest players.""

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

""What an incredible human being,"" Selanne tweeted.

Montreal Canadiens associate coach Kirk Muller also had a chance to speak with Hawerchuk in recent days.

""I talked to Dale a few days ago, and we had a good chance to chat. A good friend, had a real good opportunity to play against one of the all-time best players. As a hockey player, we all know how great he was, but he was a good friend and just a really special person, did a lot for charities. It's a real loss for us in the hockey world.""

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk ""one of the most decorated players in our game's history.""

In September 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

""For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I'm ready to fight it,"" he told TSN in October 2019. ""I want to live to tell the story.""

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie's bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames players Andrew Mangiapane and Rasmus Andersson remembered playing for Hawerchuk in Barrie.

""I don't know where I'd be without him,"" said Mangiapane. ""Very sad news today. I owe my career basically to him and the whole Barrie organization.""

Andersson, from Sweden, said ""Dale was a fantastic human being. Such a great person. My first week in Barrie he invited us over to his house and really just welcomed me to Canada. I cannot say enough good things about him as a person. Obviously a real good coach, too.""

""It's awful news.""

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday's opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at age two and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur's record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

""I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive — well maybe a little further now with the traffic,"" he said. ""I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""

""I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,"" he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and '81 with teammates that included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL's top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt like he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year — the youngest recipient at the time — and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

""Just one of the greatest. You could tell from day one. We knew from when he was 18 years old as a player that he would turn the (Jets) franchise around. Certainly one of the best I’ve ever played with and coached,"" said Dallas Stars coach Rick Bowness, who played with and coached Hawerchuk in the '80s.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

""He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,"" said Mike Doran, Winnipeg's director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the faceoff in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux's famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

""It turned out fantastic,"" said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada's call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets ""are etched in my mind every day that I live.""

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes' ring of honour.

Hawerchuk re-wrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia whom he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

""It's like going back down memory lane,"" he said in his induction speech.

""All the experiences have been fantastic,"" he added. ""I mean, sometimes they didn't feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing ... Even though I didn't win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn't change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.""

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets' Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November 2017.

""Tonight we fly Ducky's number high,"" said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue's ""Home Sweet Home,"" before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

""Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,"" said the PA announcer.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

""I've been to every part of (Manitoba), either golfing or playing (softball),"" Hawerchuk said. ""I've gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I'm honoured and I'm very humbled.""

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.

On Monday, the CFL cancelled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season.

And that includes how to allow players under contract to CFL teams the ability to sign elsewhere — most notably the NFL — if the opportunity arises. On Monday, the CFL cancelled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The focus right now for us on a few certain things and one of them is ensuring if there's an ability for our players to receive some form of payment this year,"" Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA's executive director, said Monday during a conference call. ""They should be able to do that if they have an opportunity.""

While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season. However, 66 players have currently opted out of participating in the 2020 campaign, which could create opportunity for some CFL players to sign deals south of the border and have a chance to earn a football paycheque, either on the active roster or on the practice squad.

While there's no shortage of collegiate players available, the advantage a CFL player has is pro experience, a fact not lost upon NFL personnel people.

The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign. This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.

And players on NFL practice rosters receive at least US$8,000 per week.

Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the CFL is amendable to doing what it can to help its players.

""Where we can do something we will,"" he said. ""We're going to be committed to working towards good outcomes, the best possible outcomes we can have with out players.

""That's not going to mean we're going to be able to do everything but we're certainly going to go into this with a real positive spirit.""

Something else that will be on the CFL-CFLPA radar will be the current collective bargaining agreement, which is slated to expire after the 2021 season. But union president Solomon Elimimian said the two sides covered a lot of ground this time around during talks to amend the agreement for a shortened '20 season.

""Whether we deal with '21 when it comes or after the '21 season I think there's hope there that we can work together,"" Elimimian said. ""Obviously the relationship between the players and the league needs to be one where the players feel appreciated.

""Everyone wants to the league to reach its full potential. The partnership has to be one that's very genuine and the players have to feel part of that. If that happens, the sky is the limit.""

Cavan Biggio also went deep for the Blue Jays and finished with three hits and three RBIs.

Ryu (2-1) struck out three and walked none. The left-hander permitted only one runner past second base and yielded just one extra-base hit to a team that came in ranked second in the majors with a .467 slugging percentage.

Rather than vie for strikeouts, Ryu said he was focused more on getting the Orioles to hit the ball weakly.

""I was able to keep them off balance,"" he said through an interpreter.

Signed in December to an $80 million, four-year contract, Ryu got off to a shaky start with Toronto in July before showing the form he displayed as a star with the Dodgers. He's given up a total of two runs in his last three starts after allowing eight runs over nine innings in his first two outings.

""That was vintage Ryu,"" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. ""Ryu was outstanding. That's the reason we won the game.""

The two home runs were a factor, but mostly Ryu was the difference-maker.

""They didn’t give Ryu that big contract for nothing,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""You just never know what he’s going to throw. You don’t know what side of the plate he’s going to throw to. He’s really tough on right-handers because he can locate it in. You saw a lot of us get jammed.""

The Blue Jays took control with a four-run third against Alex Cobb (1-2). Three infield hits produced a run before Grichuk delivered a three-run drive over the centre-field wall. It was his third home run of the season, all in the last four games.

""Obviously, the pitch to Grichuk was middle middle and it was a poorly executed pitch,"" Cobb said. ""But most of the pitches that I had, I felt like I executed. I got the results.""

Cobb gave up five runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He’s winless in his last four starts.

After hitting 31 homers last year, Grichuk was batting fifth, sixth or seventh in the order this season before Montoyo decided to move him into the No. 2 spot Sunday to replace injured Bo Bichette. Over the past two games, Grichuk has two homers, four hits and six RBIs.

Pedro Severino and Renato Núñez had RBIs for the Orioles, who have dropped two straight after winning seven of eight.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Bichette (right knee sprain) had an MRI and will receive a second opinion on his injury, Montoyo said. Bichette leads Toronto with a .361 batting average.

Orioles: RH Dillon Tate (elbow contusion) came off the injured list and RH Evan Phillips was optioned to the team's alternate site.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: RH Nate Pearson (0-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his fourth start in his first big league season Tuesday night. Drafted 28th overall in 2017, the 23-year-old is looking to rebound after giving up four runs to Miami last week in 2 1/3 innings. ""I'm developing at the highest level,"" Pearson said Monday. ""When I don't have my best stuff, I'm going to struggle.""

Orioles: LH Wade LeBlanc (1-0, 7.13) has allowed a combined 10 runs over 12 innings in his last three starts.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

""We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,"" Marchand said. ""That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.""

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

""We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do — little battles,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.""

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President's Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk's first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy's hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina's captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy putaway from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston's first six post-season games.

""There's other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.""

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen's late goal.

""That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,"" Williams said. ""We got it handed to us.""

NOTES: David Pastrnak had a goal and an assist in Boston’s double-overtime win in Game 1, but hasn’t played since. He had 48 regular-season goals to tie Washington’s Alex Ovechkin for the league lead. … Carolina played without 20-year-old Andrei Svechnikov, who was injured when his leg twisted awkwardly beneath him late in the third period of Saturday's loss. ... DeBrusk scored his 12th and 13th playoff goals since his 2018 post-season debut. … The Hurricanes were also without D Joel Edmundson for the third straight game. … Jake Gardiner assisted on Williams’ first-period goal for his first post-season point with Carolina.

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

article continues below

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

The gravitas of the moment was not lost on the former journalist and mother of three. After she spoke the English words of her oath of office, she paused to take a deep breath, before repeating the oath in French.

""It's about time,"" Freeland said later at a press conference on Parliament Hill.

She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.

Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.

But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.

""There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,"" said Turnbull. ""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.""

Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.

She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.

""We don't like their representative very much,"" he said of her in September 2018.

Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said ""Mama (does not equal) chopped liver."" On the back it said ""Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.""

When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.

And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.

""She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,"" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.

He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.

""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.

""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.

""I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,"" he said. ""And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.""

She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.

""What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,"" Kelly said on Twitter. ""This has been missing in the department for several years.""

MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.

While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.

Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.

Trudeau said Tuesday that she had been ""a key player in my government from day one.""

The five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations are upset that Ottawa decided to give a surplus allocation of salmon — which arose this year due to reduced recreational fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic — to commercial fishers rather than to the First Nations.

Clifford Atleo, lead negotiator for one of the nations who is also called Wickaninnish, says he feels sports and commercial troll fishers are given more rights to fish in the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

He says the latest decision to shut First Nations fishers out of an opportunity to catch more chinook salmon this year shows systemic racism is ""alive and well"" within the federal fisheries department.

""We feel very strongly we're not being dealt with fairly, we know we're not being dealt with fairly,"" Atleo said.

""It's just another layer of disappointment on the part of how the government deals with us. The government doesn't realize that their attitude toward our people is dyed-in-the-wool ... And I think the government — sometimes they don't realize they're being racist. They've got age-old policies that have never changed.""

A 2018 B.C. Supreme Court ruling directed Ottawa to take a more ""generous approach"" to allocations of chinook salmon to the First Nations given the importance of this species to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people.

The ruling from B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Humphries noted that the government's salmon allocation policy at the time gave recreational fisherman priority to fish for chinook and soho salmon ahead of the First Nations and advised the fisheries minister to reassess this policy.

Despite this ruling and changes that have since placed the First Nations at a higher priority than sport fishers, the Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ehattesaht and Mowachaht/Muchalaht nations say their yearly fishing allocations have not increased.

This year, the five First Nations were told they could fish 7,724 chinook, which amounts to just 1.5 fish per person for the 5,000 members of their communities.

COVID-19 brought a new dynamic to the salmon allocations this year, as fewer sport fishers were able to come due to pandemic restrictions. This means the recreational fleet is expected to catch 15,000 less salmon than was forecasted for this year, according to figures provided by the department.

None of this surplus is going to the First Nations.

""As per approved management plans, the Area G (commercial) harvest is adjusted based on the projected recreational harvests which results in an increase of 15,000 for 2020,"" said department spokesperson Athina Vazeos.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan was unavailable for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Jennifer Kuss, noted the improvements made in giving the five nations a higher priority in the yearly salmon catch allocations, as directed by the courts.

""This change ensures that food, social, and ceremonial (fishing) continues to be prioritized first, and additionally prioritizes the Five Nations rights-based sale fishery over the recreational and commercial fishery,"" Kuss said in a statement.

The Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations argue Ottawa could have provided some of the unused catch from this year to their people to help them support their remote communities. But Atleo said fisheries officials would not even engage in discussions about it.

""The government is trying to say they consult with us, they negotiate with us. They create their fishing plans, put it on the table and it's like take or leave it,"" Atleo said.

""All we want to do is be part of the economy, part of looking after ourselves without depending on government. We don't think that's a lot to ask.""

NDP MP Gord Johns, whose riding takes in the West Coast fishing shores, said he finds it ""disgusting"" the Trudeau government has repeatedly highlighted its desire to restore the Crown's relationship with Indigenous Peoples but has still fought many legal battles with these nations over their fishing rights.

""Indigenous people in our communities rely on this fishery for their economy, for their food security, for their culture. It's part of their way of life. These are salt water people and they rely on the salmon and to be denied their right is shameful, it's disgusting that the government is taking this approach.""

The First Nations are calling on Ottawa to revisit its decision on the surplus salmon for this year to allow them a portion of the additional catch.

""The government has an opportunity to fix this with these (surplus salmon) to come with a fair opportunity to exercise their commitment, in the judge's words, for a generous allocation to the nations and to start moving forward with reconciliation,"" Johns said.

The minister's spokeswoman says Jordan takes any allegations of systemic racism ""very seriously"" and that Ottawa is working with the five nations on a reconciliation agreement on fisheries resources, which is intended to broaden their access in the area, Kuss said.

""The road to reconciliation is a long journey, and Canada is committed to moving forward together. The department has spoken with the five nations on the reallocation of (salmon catch) on multiple occasions and that open dialogue will continue.""

The BC Wildfire Service said crews are responding to the fire on Christie Mountain about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, on the east side of Skaha Lake.

The fire is estimated at 250 hectares and firefighters on the ground are being supported by air tankers.

The service said the situation was ""rapidly evolving"" and asked everyone to stay clear of the area to avoid interfering with the operation.

The order asks residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with pets and critical items.

""We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,"" the service said in a tweet.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a ""fire of note"" on Tuesday.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was smouldering with no open flame but was considered out of control. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight.

Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Firefighters have tackled dozens of wildfires after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions.

Two fires were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

""It was nice to get on the board tonight,"" said O'Reilly.

""I haven't been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it's just one game. I've got to be consistent with it.""

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

""When we take care of the puck it's effective and it's hard on them,"" said O'Reilly.

""I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We've got to stick to our structure.""

Pietrangelo said they've been working on fixing the penalty kill.

""We've been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,"" he said.

""Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.""

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

""They're blocking a lot of shots, they're studying us. They kind of know what we're doing,"" said Miller.

He said they'll make adjustments but aren't going to go back to square one.

""We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,"" he said.

""It's not like we're getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They're a good team. We're a good team. It's going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.""

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O'Reilly, last year's Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play — the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O'Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O'Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler's stick and in.

O'Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

All Western Conference games are being played in front of no fans at Rogers Place. The players are being kept isolated in a so-called bubble between games to prevent contracting COVID-19.

They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club.","TORONTO — Richard Clune remembers the drive — the pain, the anxiety, the uncertainty, the fear.

It was the spring of 2010 and Clune, who had made his NHL debut earlier that season, was finally on the road to getting the help the 23-year-old knew he needed in his crippling addiction battle.

article continues below

With his younger brother, Matt, at the wheel, they drove through upstate New York in a torrential downpour home to Toronto. Clune wasn't sure he was going to make it.

""I was in the acute withdrawal phase,"" he said in a recent interview with The Canadian Press. ""I couldn't sit still for a second. The most logical thing at that point in time for me was to go jump off a bridge ... literally.

""I couldn't really see myself coming out of it.""

But come out of it he did, and a decade later, Clune is sharing his story in ""Hi, My Name is Dicky,"" a raw documentary available on iTunes and AppleTV that details his life from aspiring youth hockey player to out-of-control junior antagonist to pro athlete teetering on the edge — one consumed by drugs, alcohol and mental illness.

His journey to recovery started in earnest on that lonely stretch of highway.

""My brother really had to talk me off the ledge,"" Clune said. ""When I see his face and when I see my other brother Ben's face, that's what gave me strength to live, because I didn't really want to live for myself at that time.

""Matt, at a couple points on that drive, had to do things that no younger brother should have to do and really dig down deep and get me home.""

The documentary from Taylor Prestidge and Haris Usanovic of Upper Canada Films tracks Clune's life and career, recovery and redemption. It includes interviews with Clune's parents, brothers, teammates and coaches.

Clune was driven to be the best as a child, but the pressure led him down a dark path at early age.

""I made that decision I was going to put my head down and not see anything but being a hockey player,"" Clune, who was selected in the third round of the 2005 NHL draft by the Dallas Stars, says in the film.

He began to try alcohol in his early teens as a way to cope, and it escalated quickly once he got to high school and then the Ontario Hockey League.

""I had this hole inside me that made me insecure and afraid of the world,"" Clune recounts. ""I got wasted and was like, 'Wow. OK. I'll be able to do this. I can cope with this. It's like a warm blanket.'

""Alcohol saved me. It was my solution to that problem of being self-absorbed and focused on all the things that made me insecure and self-conscious and in pain and sad.""

But he didn't realize how much of a spiral his life was taking. In junior, he would drive from bar to bar, party to party, drinking, smoking marjiuana and doing cocaine.

""I wanted to walk that line of looking death in the face every day, but still play hockey and do all these things,"" Clune says in the film. ""I don't know how I did it.""

Things got worse after junior when he was living in the United States by himself before making his NHL debut in that fateful 2009-10 season, months before becoming completely unglued.

""I had achieved my goal,"" he recalls on screen. ""But I hated myself.""

Clune eventually checked into rehab a second time — he went once before, but didn't stay — and committed to getting better with a lot of help from the people around him.

After he got out, he resumed his career and went onto play a total of 120 regular-season games in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Nashville Predators. His contract was bought out in 2015, and he was again at a crossroads — retire or keep going.

That's when the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were in the early stages of their massive rebuild, came calling to see if Clune wanted to be part of their program. They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club. At the very least, he would play in the minors and help foster a new culture.

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, who was in charge of the minor-league Marlies at the time, saw something in Clune that could be useful.

""He provides a certain energy,"" Dubas said. ""He provides experience in his life that I thought brought a great spirit to our team.""

Clune played 19 games with Leafs, but the forward truly made his mark with the Marlies. He helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018 and plans to continue his on-ice career, but equally important was how he's helped mentor a number of current NHLers.

He's proud of where he is, and not shy talking about how he got there. Clune still goes to meetings, does the 12 steps and now works to help others.

He also thinks a lot about why he made the decision to live, to fight, and get better, when many others — including some fellow pro hockey players — have gone down a different path.

""In the beginning, it was because I wanted to see my brothers,"" said Clune, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Then it transformed into wanting to live for myself. I started to discover what it feels like to have self esteem and to have love.

""I just hope people realize that they're not alone with how they feel. Don't be afraid to ask for help.""

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

""After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,"" Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal's three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first overall by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

""A low-maintenance superstar,"" said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg's senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At five foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn't blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack of getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday. ""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League. I think it was Dale's arrival that really cemented the future of the franchise and I think we all have recollections of that first year, that Calder (Trophy) year and then everything that would follow.

""He was truly a superstar as a hockey player, but I think why he was so loved here was not just that but largely the fact that he made this his home and became one of us. I think everybody shared that sense of pride in Dale's career as a player.""

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: ""All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL's all time greatest players.""

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

""What an incredible human being,"" Selanne tweeted.

Montreal Canadiens associate coach Kirk Muller also had a chance to speak with Hawerchuk in recent days.

""I talked to Dale a few days ago, and we had a good chance to chat. A good friend, had a real good opportunity to play against one of the all-time best players. As a hockey player, we all know how great he was, but he was a good friend and just a really special person, did a lot for charities. It's a real loss for us in the hockey world.""

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk ""one of the most decorated players in our game's history.""

In September 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

""For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I'm ready to fight it,"" he told TSN in October 2019. ""I want to live to tell the story.""

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie's bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames players Andrew Mangiapane and Rasmus Andersson remembered playing for Hawerchuk in Barrie.

""I don't know where I'd be without him,"" said Mangiapane. ""Very sad news today. I owe my career basically to him and the whole Barrie organization.""

Andersson, from Sweden, said ""Dale was a fantastic human being. Such a great person. My first week in Barrie he invited us over to his house and really just welcomed me to Canada. I cannot say enough good things about him as a person. Obviously a real good coach, too.""

""It's awful news.""

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday's opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at age two and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur's record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

""I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive — well maybe a little further now with the traffic,"" he said. ""I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""

""I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,"" he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and '81 with teammates that included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL's top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt like he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year — the youngest recipient at the time — and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

""Just one of the greatest. You could tell from day one. We knew from when he was 18 years old as a player that he would turn the (Jets) franchise around. Certainly one of the best I’ve ever played with and coached,"" said Dallas Stars coach Rick Bowness, who played with and coached Hawerchuk in the '80s.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

""He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,"" said Mike Doran, Winnipeg's director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the faceoff in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux's famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

""It turned out fantastic,"" said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada's call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets ""are etched in my mind every day that I live.""

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes' ring of honour.

Hawerchuk re-wrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia whom he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

""It's like going back down memory lane,"" he said in his induction speech.

""All the experiences have been fantastic,"" he added. ""I mean, sometimes they didn't feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing ... Even though I didn't win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn't change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.""

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets' Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November 2017.

""Tonight we fly Ducky's number high,"" said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue's ""Home Sweet Home,"" before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

""Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,"" said the PA announcer.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

""I've been to every part of (Manitoba), either golfing or playing (softball),"" Hawerchuk said. ""I've gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I'm honoured and I'm very humbled.""

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.

And that includes how to allow players under contract to CFL teams the ability to sign elsewhere — most notably the NFL — if the opportunity arises. On Monday, the CFL cancelled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The focus right now for us on a few certain things and one of them is ensuring if there's an ability for our players to receive some form of payment this year,"" Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA's executive director, said Monday during a conference call. ""They should be able to do that if they have an opportunity.""

While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season. However, 66 players have currently opted out of participating in the 2020 campaign, which could create opportunity for some CFL players to sign deals south of the border and have a chance to earn a football paycheque, either on the active roster or on the practice squad.

While there's no shortage of collegiate players available, the advantage a CFL player has is pro experience, a fact not lost upon NFL personnel people.

The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign. This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.

And players on NFL practice rosters receive at least US$8,000 per week.

Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the CFL is amendable to doing what it can to help its players.

""Where we can do something we will,"" he said. ""We're going to be committed to working towards good outcomes, the best possible outcomes we can have with out players.

""That's not going to mean we're going to be able to do everything but we're certainly going to go into this with a real positive spirit.""

Something else that will be on the CFL-CFLPA radar will be the current collective bargaining agreement, which is slated to expire after the 2021 season. But union president Solomon Elimimian said the two sides covered a lot of ground this time around during talks to amend the agreement for a shortened '20 season.

""Whether we deal with '21 when it comes or after the '21 season I think there's hope there that we can work together,"" Elimimian said. ""Obviously the relationship between the players and the league needs to be one where the players feel appreciated.

""Everyone wants to the league to reach its full potential. The partnership has to be one that's very genuine and the players have to feel part of that. If that happens, the sky is the limit.""

Cavan Biggio also went deep for the Blue Jays and finished with three hits and three RBIs.

Ryu (2-1) struck out three and walked none. The left-hander permitted only one runner past second base and yielded just one extra-base hit to a team that came in ranked second in the majors with a .467 slugging percentage.

Rather than vie for strikeouts, Ryu said he was focused more on getting the Orioles to hit the ball weakly.

""I was able to keep them off balance,"" he said through an interpreter.

Signed in December to an $80 million, four-year contract, Ryu got off to a shaky start with Toronto in July before showing the form he displayed as a star with the Dodgers. He's given up a total of two runs in his last three starts after allowing eight runs over nine innings in his first two outings.

""That was vintage Ryu,"" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. ""Ryu was outstanding. That's the reason we won the game.""

The two home runs were a factor, but mostly Ryu was the difference-maker.

""They didn’t give Ryu that big contract for nothing,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""You just never know what he’s going to throw. You don’t know what side of the plate he’s going to throw to. He’s really tough on right-handers because he can locate it in. You saw a lot of us get jammed.""

The Blue Jays took control with a four-run third against Alex Cobb (1-2). Three infield hits produced a run before Grichuk delivered a three-run drive over the centre-field wall. It was his third home run of the season, all in the last four games.

""Obviously, the pitch to Grichuk was middle middle and it was a poorly executed pitch,"" Cobb said. ""But most of the pitches that I had, I felt like I executed. I got the results.""

Cobb gave up five runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He’s winless in his last four starts.

After hitting 31 homers last year, Grichuk was batting fifth, sixth or seventh in the order this season before Montoyo decided to move him into the No. 2 spot Sunday to replace injured Bo Bichette. Over the past two games, Grichuk has two homers, four hits and six RBIs.

Pedro Severino and Renato Núñez had RBIs for the Orioles, who have dropped two straight after winning seven of eight.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Bichette (right knee sprain) had an MRI and will receive a second opinion on his injury, Montoyo said. Bichette leads Toronto with a .361 batting average.

Orioles: RH Dillon Tate (elbow contusion) came off the injured list and RH Evan Phillips was optioned to the team's alternate site.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: RH Nate Pearson (0-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his fourth start in his first big league season Tuesday night. Drafted 28th overall in 2017, the 23-year-old is looking to rebound after giving up four runs to Miami last week in 2 1/3 innings. ""I'm developing at the highest level,"" Pearson said Monday. ""When I don't have my best stuff, I'm going to struggle.""

Orioles: LH Wade LeBlanc (1-0, 7.13) has allowed a combined 10 runs over 12 innings in his last three starts.

DeBrusk scored twice while the Bruins scored four straight goals to rally and beat the Hurricanes 4-3 on Monday to take a 3-1 lead in their first-round playoff series.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

""We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,"" Marchand said. ""That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.""

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

""We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do — little battles,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.""

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President's Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk's first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy's hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina's captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy putaway from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston's first six post-season games.

""There's other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.""

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen's late goal.

""That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,"" Williams said. ""We got it handed to us.""

NOTES: David Pastrnak had a goal and an assist in Boston’s double-overtime win in Game 1, but hasn’t played since. He had 48 regular-season goals to tie Washington’s Alex Ovechkin for the league lead. … Carolina played without 20-year-old Andrei Svechnikov, who was injured when his leg twisted awkwardly beneath him late in the third period of Saturday's loss. ... DeBrusk scored his 12th and 13th playoff goals since his 2018 post-season debut. … The Hurricanes were also without D Joel Edmundson for the third straight game. … Jake Gardiner assisted on Williams’ first-period goal for his first post-season point with Carolina.

So we are committed to both broadening and deepening the rather narrow base of those who have been engaged in the Conversations we have been having.","Tip O’Neill, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives in the 1980s, famously remarked “all politics is local.” Significant change rarely starts at the top and moves down, mainly because the powerful do very well out of the current situation and seldom have any incentive to change it. Instead, change usually comes from the bottom up.

Occasionally — when faced with intransigence — that change has to come through violence and revolution, but more often, it happens relatively peacefully and in an evolutionary manner, although not without the need for anger, determination and confrontation on occasion — witness the Black Lives Matter movement.

Other recent examples include the growing acceptance of gay marriage and the youth climate strikes.

The concept of Conversations for a One Planet Region — a non-profit community organization we established in November 2019 after almost three years of working as a loose network — is rooted in this understanding that all politics is local. We believe that before we can take effective action we need to learn about, discuss and understand both the global and — importantly — the local level implications of the massive and rapid global ecological changes we have created.

The word “conversation” is key: We believe our discussions about these issues must be local and in person, face-to-face to the extent that is possible in the present circumstances. A second important reason for keeping the conversations local is that it is an important form of community building.

Thus, we use only local speakers/conversation leaders, because we believe we have more than enough knowledge, expertise and experience right here in the Greater Victoria Region to create a One Planet region.

Local change and local action are important, indeed vital, but they need to be rooted in a very different set of values to those that drive decision-making today, not just in our own Western democratic society, but globally. In our work, we have come to see what we are doing as encouraging a form of cultural evolution, looking for ways to accelerate the change in the deep cultural values that lie at the heart of our problems.

In his recent book, The Patterning Instinct, which explores “the deep historical foundations of our modern worldview,” Jeremy Lent identifies what he calls root metaphors.

They include the notion of “nature as machine” and our belief in “conquering nature”; the idea that indefinite growth is both possible and desirable, and the idea that it is normal to be selfish and pursue our own self-interest rather than the welfare of the group or community.

Lent is clear that if we are to achieve the deep transformation of civilization that is needed, we must change these root metaphors and establish new core values. He has identified three sets of values as “foundational principles for our major decisions”: An emphasis on quality of life rather than just how much wealth and “stuff” we have; a sense of shared humanity where we are part of and have responsibilities to other people; and a commitment to environmental sustainability rooted in a sense of connection to nature and other species.

So in our next series of monthly Conversations starting in September — necessarily online at present — we will begin by exploring how values shift, how we can identify or stimulate key social tipping points and accelerate social and cultural evolution locally toward a commitment to becoming a One Planet Region.

Then, in the following three months up to the end of the year, we will explore in turn each of the three core values that Jeremy Lent has identified.

Clearly, understanding our situation and recognizing the values shift that is necessary has to be widespread, and not confined to a small group who get it already.

So we are committed to both broadening and deepening the rather narrow base of those who have been engaged in the Conversations we have been having. We urgently need a region-wide Conversation about the core values that are required and their implications for the individual and collective decisions we must make if we are to successfully make the transition to a healthier, more just and sustainable future for our children and the generations beyond them.

Budget talks are already underway in some municipalities, and city councillors will be crunching the numbers. While the local politics of policing will be interesting to follow, who knows what might shake out at the provincial and federal levels.

You don’t have to venture far in most cities to see police lights flashing and hear sirens wailing. It has become disturbingly common especially in the heart of most downtown cores.

This week, we cast some of that light on Peel’s Sixth Policing Principle, which states “police use physical force to the extent necessary to secure observance of the law or to restore order only when the exercise of persuasion, advice and warning is found to be insufficient.”

Some would argue that the use of force by many police departments and their officers seems to be on the rise. It’s a complex problem that certainly merits close attention, and a lot more research.

Let’s face it, modern policing has provided more tools to secure observance of the law and restore order than ever before. As civilians, we would prefer an officer’s persuasion, advice or warning over staring down the barrel of gun, being stunned by a Taser, struck with a baton or pepper sprayed — anytime.

Last week, the Ontario Human Rights Commission released a disturbing report on their inquiry into racial profiling and racial discrimination of Black persons by the Toronto Police. It’s their second interim report. The data analysis ranges from 2013 to 2017.

The findings indicate that black people represent almost 32 per cent of people charged while they only make up 8.8 per cent of the population in Toronto. There has been an immediate call for action by the commission, and many others.

The Special Investigations Unit, which is responsible for investigating incidents of death, serious injury, sexual allegations and assaults, involved Black people in 25 per cent of all investigations.

Further findings indicated that 39 per cent of cases are not investigated by this unit because they involve a lower-level of force, which begs the question: Who is investigating those cases?

There are so many questions now being raised regarding matters where the police have used force, and the public is demanding answers. It’s complicated further when police investigate these matters themselves with little or no civilian oversight.

Further frustration stems from how long many of these investigations take. The RCMP watchdog is recommending statutory deadlines in order to speed up this process and have their officers respond in a timelier manner.

The Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP says that their case findings are often sent to the police service for further input before a final report is completed, and this can sometimes take years.

It’s little wonder then that the public or a victim loses faith in the police. Remember, justice delayed is justice denied.

The current state of policing should encourage us to seek out the best ways possible to reduce the need for officers to use force, although it will always be necessary in some cases. Training is always the first and best line of defence so perhaps more verbal judo, de-escalation tactics or simply having a subtler approach could save more lives.

Every police incident is unique, and can often be unpredictable so officer safety is paramount. However, we must protect everyone in these circumstances, especially those who have been marginalized and are most vulnerable.

In Margaret Wheatley’s book titled Turning to One Another: Simple Conversations to Restore Hope to the Future, the author shares a poem we can all learn from.

In it, she writes: “Remember, you don’t fear people whose story you know. Real listening always brings people closer together.”

Perhaps we should all start listening more, including police officers. We must all strive to resolve our problems peacefully. We might fear people a lot less if we just took the time that was necessary to learn their stories before resorting to force of any kind.

The rich — who have largely been able to cocoon themselves from the wrath of the global pandemic — continue to extract the services, and even lives, of the poor for their comfort.

That grotesque distance between the haves and have-nots lies naked and exposed by COVID-19 around the world.

Toronto’s own public health data offers irrefutable numerical evidence of a common story of affluent travellers unintentionally bringing COVID-19 in and being able to benefit — unintentionally, instantly — from a lockdown, leaving poorer bodies, racialized bodies, residing in smaller homes, in underserviced neighbourhoods, ripe for the picking by the virus.

Many of them work jobs deemed “essential.” So essential that without them, society falls apart at the seams. These are jobs that are appreciated with a minimum wage. That topsy-turvy prioritizing — touted as a trickle-down economy that rewards the rich first — is the driver of systemic oppressions.

Unintentionality is the secret of the invisibility of the system, which requires simply that people with privilege do what they’ve always done, to not think, not critique, not disrupt the status quo.

If the oppressed in rich countries have suffered, those in poorer nations have suffered exponentially more.

It’s clear we are all connected; when immigrants lose their precarious jobs in wealthy countries it causes a domino effect downstream. Almost a third of Bangladesh is flooded. But this year, by the time the swollen river waters spilled over in June, people were already low on food; many had stopped working due to the pandemic and relatives abroad who send money home had lost jobs.

Countries around the world are witnessing overlapping disasters.

Mexico, the nation wracked by poverty despite a high gross domestic product, is overwhelmed by hurricanes and storms even while it tracks as the third-highest in the world for COVID-19 fatalities with more than 52,000 deaths.

As awareness of interconnectedness of the issues and of the people rises and sparks action, so does the backlash, bearing down on all those who dissent.

The U.S. repeatedly deployed armed troops to quell widespread and mostly peaceful anti-Black-racism protests that are now in their third month.

In Zimbabwe, where the inflation rate is more than 700 per cent and doctors and nurses from dilapidated hospitals are on strike, the president has clamped down on dissenting voices; his security forces allegedly abducting and torturing opposition party members.

The Philippines sent millions of citizens back into a partial lockdown to give overwhelmed health-care workers a break. But in April its trigger-happy president publicly said he had asked armed forces to “shoot dead” anyone who violated the restrictions. This was just as Manila residents were rallying to demand food aid after millions of workers lost their jobs.

Meanwhile in India, with 1.8 million COVID-19 cases amid the onslaught of a fierce monsoon that has already displaced millions, the country is reeling. That hasn’t forced it to ease its grip on Kashmir, which is now marking a full year since India revoked its partial autonomy, stripped it off statehood, incarcerated even pro-India leaders and imposed a harsh shutdown. COVID-19 gave the government an excuse to impose further lockdowns. This week, it tightened the noose on Kashmir by imposing a two-day curfew in its capital city to clamp down on planned protests.

The Kashmiri lockdown consists of the Indian police and paramilitary forces roaming the streets with assault rifles, laying razor wire across bridges and placing steel barricades across roads.

Already-wretched neighbourhoods are being blighted everywhere.

We bear witness to a failing world, misaligned with loftier principles of egalitarianism it claims to cherish, a world that is not even sustainable.

It seems obvious that we can’t keep building solutions in self-interest at the expense of others. Our streets here, filled with protests, may give the impression that we — the ordinary folks — are rising, are being heard. The rest of the world shows just how easy it is to quell protest. More people need to rise, continuously so, passing the baton from group to group.

Otherwise, darker disparities loom. The politics of capital have always been about the politics of power.

We may be dystopian already but perched on the verge of worse, ceding all control to the obscenely rich. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos made $34 billion US during the pandemic from March to May and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg made $25 billion.

The handful of other billionaires did pretty well, too, unemployment be damned. As if that is not vulgar enough, Bezos is likely to become the world’s first trillionaire in a few years.

All hail the new kings.

North Cowichan is unique in Canada in that it possesses some 5,000 hectares of its own forest land – the Municipal Forest Reserve, also known as the Six Mountains – property it has been logging for profit, with an annual allowable cut set at 20,000 cubic metres per year.

Problem is, the Forest Reserve falls within the “coastal douglas-fir” biogeoclimatic zone, which is the rarest of 16 such zones in the province. The range of this ecological zone is small and thin, but includes southeastern Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands and has been heavily impacted by private land ownership and logging.

Higher elevations in the Forest Reserve merge into the “very dry maritime coastal western hemlock” zone, which is also at risk for the same reasons, says Andy MacKinnnon, co-author of the best-selling reference book, the Plants of Coastal British Columbia.

Coastal douglas-fir represents the “smallest and most at risk zone in B.C.,” confirms the Coastal Douglas-fir & Associated Ecosystems Conservation Partnership. It is “home to the highest number of species and ecosystems at risk in B.C.” and “less than one per cent” remains in old-growth forests,” says the Partnership, which is a vast coalition that includes the B.C. government, municipalities – but not North Cowichan – and conservation organizations.

The municipality has for months been promising a public consultation on the future of the Forest Reserve, one that is open, broad, deep, fair, robust and transparent process.

So far, nothing could be further from reality.

On July 17, the municipality announced it is pausing the public consultation for 60 days to allow a separate consultation with First Nations to proceed.

The public hasn’t a clue what government-to-government talks with First Nations are discussing. And public consultations to date have generated criticism of unnecessary secrecy and pro-logging bias.

The consultant, Lees and Associates, and the municipality have ordered that meetings of the citizens’ Working Group – appointed to guide the consultation process – remain closed, even after a clear majority of the Working Group voted in favour of openness.

To shed some much-need light on the issue, I posted a short video (through my sixmountains.ca blog), The Unseen Forest: youtube.com/watch?v=XqU6h2OZRos.

The video employs drone footage of municipal clearcutting atop iconic Mount Prevost, which is also a place of cultural significance to First Nations. I wanted to refute a statement the municipal administrator made to council: “We do not clear-cut as a harvesting practice.”

I also wanted residents who cannot make it to the top of Mount Prevost to see for themselves what’s happening.

The video has generated a lot of discussion, some of it unhealthy.

Pro-logging advocates have been ordered to stop their abusive on-line remarks against those seeking a conservation vision for the Six Mountains. The administrator of the Facebook Maple Bay Neighbour to Neighbour public group, posted the following warning: “As we are in a very small window of opportunity where we can have a say in the future of our … forests, I really would like this discussion to continue. However, I will not allow for bullying and personal attacks to continue.”

There is another way forward for the Six Mountains.

University of B.C. forestry experts recently appeared before council to not only encourage greater protection for the coastal Douglas-fir zone, but to report that the Municipality stands to earn as much or more from selling carbon credits and leaving our endangered forests standing.

The forestry program has earned an annual net profit of only $132,000 over the long term – a figure that has been padded in recent years by inclusion of $86,000 in cell-tower rentals.

The jobs argument also does not carry much weight, since as few as about 10 direct jobs – two of those municipal administration staff – are created by cutting these rare forests. The final kicker is that 63 per cent of the timber removed from the Forest Reserve was exported as raw logs last year.

The case for conservation is being made daily in the Forest Reserve. I only wish I could say that North Cowichan council is listening.

Regrettably Screech is only one of many who’ve been victimized by such scams.

Some of us have received phone calls or emails claiming to come from law enforcement agencies. We are told a warrant has been issued for our arrest, and the police will arrive unless an immediate fine is paid.

Others are warned they owe the CRA money, and various threats are made to extort payment. Credit card accounts have also been hacked.

The volume of these scams, which began in earnest several years ago, has grown as the COVID epidemic surges. The victims are often elderly people, perhaps already anxious about their health and vulnerable to intimidating calls.

What is particularly frustrating is how rarely anyone gets caught, despite the extent of this racket. Between 2014 and 2019, CRA hacks alone netted $17 million, country-wide, yet law enforcement agencies report only a handful of arrests.

While our local police departments are sympathetic, their attention appears focussed mainly on damage control. Contact them to report a scam, and the best you can hope for is advice about how to avoid becoming a victim, or how to limit damage already done.

But even getting their attention can be a challenge. The Victoria police department didn’t respond when we asked what they’re doing to catch scammers.

The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, which is supposed to be quarterbacking such efforts, didn’t reply either. We got a recorded message saying the centre is indefinitely closed.

This is, to put it mildly, discouraging. We understand the limitations caused by the current COVID outbreak. But surely at least skeleton crews could be at work on this challenge.

In fact there has been some limited progress. RCMP detachments in Ontario are running an investigation called Project OCTAVIA. It aims primarily at CRA scams, but also bank account fraud.

Last month it was revealed that these scams are being operated mainly out of India. Unfortunately, police raids in that country have failed to accomplish much of anything.

As a result the OCTAVIA project is targeted mainly at so-called “money mules” here in Canada. These low-level recruits place the phone calls and emails intended to defraud unwitting victims, bundle the cash, and pass it along to their bosses in India.

Recently one of these mules, Jatin Chahal from Brampton, Ontario, was caught.

Chahal, age 21, is charged with fraud over $5,000, possession of the proceeds of crime, and laundering the proceeds of crime.

Unfortunately he was immediately released on an undertaking to appear at a Brampton court in September.

We say “unfortunately”, because when RCMP officials accused a second man of being a mule, he promptly fled the country. Henry Xue of Vancouver was allegedly part of a ring which conducted credit card frauds.

His bank account records showed more than $1 million being moved in an out over a short period of time. Xue’s family insist he is innocent.

It might be thought those scam phone calls and emails would leave an electronic footprint that, at least in theory, should be traceable.

It’s understood that mules use “ghost” addresses to conceal their true identity. Yet with sophisticated software, can’t our law enforcement agencies make more of a dent in this problem?

The answer is that they’re reluctant to say what they are doing. If their reason is to protect ongoing investigations, that is quite proper. Necessarily, much of the effort to combat these scams flies under the radar.

Yet the limited success rate is well below the level required to confront what has become a major industry.

Nor is it sufficient to issue merely defensive advice. If the scam is sophisticated enough, anyone can be tricked.

Consider this example. A 23-year-old Cornwall, Ont., woman was robbed of her life savings after being called by someone identifying himself as an RCMP officer.

He gave the woman his badge number, and his caller ID showed up as belonging to the local RCMP detachment. She was fooled, and handed over her hard-earned savings.

When this is the kind of chicanery we are up against, a full-scale police campaign is required to root out these scammers and send them to jail.

If resources are lacking, let Parliament provide them. For until this is done, no-one is safe."

Police dragged him through his Apple Daily newsroom in handcuffs Monday to make an example of him: If you dare to crusade for democratization, incarceration awaits.

article continues below

Such is the price of defiance.

The message could not have been clearer. Coming just days after Hong Kong cancelled elections, and mere weeks after Beijing imposed a draconian national security law, his arrest has stripped any last pretense of democracy or autonomy from this former British crown colony.

Lai is incarcerated but not cowed, just as the seven million people of Hong Kong are disenfranchised but unbowed. Prison, he mused, would be a good chance to catch up on his reading.

“I will have the opportunity to read books I haven’t read,” he announced with customary resolve as his arrest loomed.

This is the defiant Lai I came to know during my seven years in Hong Kong running the Toronto Star’s Asia Bureau. He enjoyed the company of foreign correspondents, inviting them for brunch in his sumptuous private garden or a cruise through the harbour on his splendid yacht.

The luxe was merely for show — a side show in status-conscious Hong Kong, a city swimming in affluence and drowning in privation. In truth, he sought out foreign outlets as a vehicle to get the message out that Hong Kong needed the world to keep watch, and keep faith — which is precisely why he provokes the wrath of the authorities today.

Gruff and blunt, disinclined to bluffs or bluster, he remains Hong Kong’s most atypical tycoon and unpredictable publisher.

He makes no pretence of being a public intellectual — unlike Martin Lee, that other aging stalwart of the democracy movement I came to know (both were arrested briefly in April) — because Lai leads from the heart and goes with his gut.

That makes him hard to stop, harder to shut up, and harder still to shut down. The authorities are stopping at nothing, arresting his children and staff while raiding the newsroom to ratchet up every pressure point.

In prison, he might read up on the history of humiliation and intimidation that marked the Cultural Revolution a half-century ago, when the likes of Lai were paraded in the streets with dunce caps so that spectators would stay in line. Monday’s police tactic of punishing a publisher with a “perp walk” in the precincts of his own newspaper is a perfect reprise of Maoist times on the mainland.

The arresting officers are little better than the Red Guards who once did the party’s bidding. They are Hong Kong’s thought police.

It is no accident that a newspaper publisher would be among the most brazen targets of the latest crackdown. The objective is no longer repressing protests, but suppressing thoughts and disrupting democracy.

Lai’s thoughts are not so easily ordered.

Where most of the erstwhile colony’s capitalist elite moves in lockstep with their Communist overlords, Lai is not cut from the same cloth.

His Giordano chain of clothing stores cut a swath through Hong Kong and the mainland with a customer focus that proved revolutionary in its staid time.

Copying the same formula, his upstart tabloid gave readers what they wanted — starting with salacious coverage of a secretive elite, progressing to spirited exposés on corrupt politicians, culminating with an unabashed crusade for democracy in one of the world’s most literate yet least liberated polities. He replicated the formula yet again in Taiwan — another safe space for a free Chinese press — where he could torment politicians with impunity.

Until he couldn’t. Lai escaped China at age 12 to escape dictatorship, only to find himself in its embrace all these years later at the age of 71 as Communist rule reasserts itself.

In the 1984 Sino-British Declaration, Beijing guaranteed 50 years of autonomy and democratization upon the 1997 handover, under the rubric of “One Country, Two Systems.”

Two weeks ago, Hong Kong announced a one-year delay in scheduled September legislative elections (with limited powers, it must be noted) — on the pretence of a COVID-19 crisis, but in reality to thwart the momentum built up by pro-democracy candidates.

Imagine if everyone else on the planet postponed democracy until further notice, pending production of a vaccine years from now. Chinese authorities seem more interested in inoculating Hong Kong from the democracy virus than protecting it from a pandemic.

Not even in Donald Trump’s America is there serious talk of rescheduling elections. Which is why a coalition of concerned countries — notably Canada, the U.S., U.K., Australia and New Zealand — has condemned the latest developments while imposing restrictions on Hong Kong trade and consular links.

Canadians are especially seized of Hong Kong’s fate, given the hundreds of thousands of people who immigrated here after 1997. Equally, hundreds of thousands of Canadian citizens live as expatriates in Hong Kong, mindful of China’s growing ruthlessness — not least the ransoming of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, still imprisoned as retaliation for the Huawei affair.

Those reliable cash cows — booze and gambling — are still delivering, but to a lesser degree. And the new member of the herd — legal cannabis — is just hitting its stride.

With governments facing decades of deficits, they’ll be nurturing those profit centres while simultaneously leaning on sin taxes for years to come, and probably inventing more.

The new pop tax on sweet carbonated drinks ($30 million a year) was delayed until the end of September, but it’s a taste of things to come.

The bar and restaurant closures in the spring made for a big drop in liquor revenue to the government. But that was offset by a spike in retail purchases, which has now levelled off.

The continuing shutdown of casinos is costing government more than $20 million a week and has since they were closed in mid-March. But cannabis sales are holding steady month by month.

With far more stores open this year compared to last, B.C.’s cannabis revenue will more than double compared to the inaugural year.

That’s likely the only revenue stream in the entire government that will be higher this year than last, although it’s only because of the slow roll-out of the legal cannabis market in the first year.

A recent overview in the legislature showed the Liquor Distribution Branch held to its original budget plan in the first quarter, but it’s unlikely to continue. Even though bars and restaurants have resumed, service is curtailed and patronage is down.

Last month the government started selling liquor to restaurants at the wholesale price, eliminating a markup. That saves operators up to 25 per cent of the cost and will last until next spring. It will cost the government about $28 million over the period in lost revenue. Attorney General David Eby said the LDB is currently projecting a $1.1 billion profit, down slightly from it’s pre-pandemic estimate.

“But there are a number of trends that could play out differently,” he said. Retail sales won’t like make up for hospitality sector reductions for the rest of this year, he said. It all depends on infection rates and any public health closures that may arise.

On the cannabis side, there’s nothing but growth potential. With 19 government stores now open and more than 250 private ones up and running, the money is flowing in. Business leaders are already eyeing the new sector as one that can help rescue the economy. The provincial chamber of commerce recently urged government to drop the red tape and open it further to create more jobs.

Eby said cannabis is forecast to bring $350 million in revenue this year. Last year’s sales were $135 million, he said.

“That is money that is not going to organized crime. Also, that $350 million in product was grown by licensed producers that do not bypass hydro utilities, cause house fires and other public health issues with remediating grow-ops in residential areas.”

There are still widespread reports of illicit sales in First Nations’ jurisdictions where the required permits and authorizations aren’t in place. Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth confirmed it is illegal, but was vague about what’s being done about that, saying it’s a “complicated complex” issue.

The estimate is that more than half the marijuana consumed in B.C. is now sold legally. Farnworth considers that a win, but opposition critics warned the black market is still booming.

The picture in the gambling sector isn’t nearly as rosy. B.C. Lottery Corp. was targeting almost $1.4 billion in net revenue this year, but will fall well short. The casinos were closed March 13 and Eby said it’s up to Dr. Bonnie Henry when they re-open. In normal times they produce $23 million a week in revenue.

BCLC and casino operators have submitted safe reopening plans but Eby said if they do re-open they won’t likely meet previous revenues. The government has committed to maintaining the community grants that flow from that revenue at the same level as last year, $140 million.

The same guarantee doesn’t apply to the bigger sums that flow into the treasury for general use.

But in B.C, in 2020 on at least one particular issue, it struck home. Because by a number of measures, it’s simply true.

NDP critics spent years accosting the former B.C. Liberal government for ignoring homelessness and the drug crisis that is driving much of it. Three years ago they got their chance to show what they could do. Despite a steady blizzard of announcements and news releases about all the expensive new efforts underway, there’s scant evidence that they’re making much progress.

It was North Vancouver Liberal MLA Jane Thornthwaite who made the observation above. She supplied chilling background numbers that bring home the enormity of what’s happening. One of them related to overdoses is particularly acute.

The NDP created a standalone Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions when it took over, with a mandate to make “substantive progress” on an “immediate response” to the opioid crisis. Even before the pandemic struck, the number of overdose fatalities was holding steady. And even though COVID-19 has hit B.C. relatively lightly to date and had much less impact on the street community than you might have expected, drug overdoses deaths are at their highest levels ever. A handful of deaths every single day is the new standard. The only noticeable measure of success is the number of deaths averted. Thornthwaite cited a CBC report that on one day in June, first responders across B.C. dealt with 131 overdoses, presumably saving most of them. She said in July they clocked 2,700 overdose reports, 87 a day.

It’s stunning to realize the potential death toll if hundreds of first responders weren’t out administering thousands of life-saving remedies.

It’s a similar story with homelessness. Despite pouring millions of dollars into new housing — in a controversial, heavy-handed fashion when it comes to Victoria — it’s the same perennial topic of conversation and anxiety among taxpayers it has been for years.

The NDP critics of years past had all the answers. Now they have all the power to implement them, but they aren’t taking effect to the degree they thought they would.

“Homelessness is up,” said Thornthwaite, who has done a lot of committee work on mental health issues. “Community disorder is up. Break-ins are up, vandalism is up, assaults are up, open drug use and drug paraphernalia in parks are up.”

There was new data this week that supported Social Development Minister Shane Simpson’s admission a few weeks ago that homelessness is on the upswing. The point-in-time count in metro Vancouver showed jumps of varying degrees across that region. More striking is that it is spreading across B.C. to the point where virtually every community is grappling with it. Simpson, who left an impression quite different from the one put out by the government’s housing statistics, estimated there are about 40 homeless camps around B.C.

The Opposition has cited dozens of instances of downtown residents and businesses having to deal with the fallout. People are afraid to work alone, they’re witnessing violence and theft on a daily basis, clients have to step over comatose addicts lying in the street and on and on.

All the above and more was presented to Housing Minister Selina Robinson on Monday. Her response was the traditional one used by every first-term government: “Frankly, it’s because B.C. Liberals didn’t do what they needed to do on this file.”

Robinson said they’re starting to make progress and there’s a ten-year-plan. True enough. But four-year governments coming up with ten-year plans is just as silly as a three-year-old government blaming its failures on its predecessors. The NDP in opposition knew how intractable addiction and homelessness issues were, but they left the impression all it would take to ease those two crises was their commitment to make things right.

That impression now looks to be completely erroneous.

Even if we shred our garbage beyond recognition, our waste still says volumes about us. So to speak.

In fact, if somebody really wants to learn about us, they can probably find out more about us than we know ourselves.

It’s happening already. As of last month, for example, local researchers began plumbing this daily data dump for signs of COVID-19 among us. Researchers from the University of Victoria have partnered with local tech company Pani Energy to collect and analyze sewage samples taken from local pumping stations to detect incipient outbreaks of COVID-19.

It’s the start of a project to monitor and report to public- health authorities on data gathered from wastewater treatment plants across the province. The goal is to develop an early warning system to alert health authorities when outbreaks are on the point of happening in a region.

When a person is infected with the coronavirus, the virus’s DNA shows up in that person’s poo days before they start feeling ill and even if they have no symptoms. Monitoring Victoria’s sewage for traces of the virus can yield an accurate, community-level picture of emerging infection rates up to days — possibly a week — before doctors and hospitals start seeing people needing treatment.

The researchers can’t pinpoint the person or even the household putting the viral DNA into the system. All going well, however, they’ll be able to identify areas within the region that are sloughing higher viral loads, based on where samples are sampled and how much DNA each sample contains. There’s a bit more involved than that, of course.

Sewage offers up a honey wagon-load of information about us. In another case of secrets revealed, the B.C. Centre for Disease Control used samples from sewer overflows and wastewater treatment plants, as well as municipal raw sewage discharge to track the spread of norovirus to shellfish farms on the coast. Thanks to those efforts, a 2018 norovirus outbreak linked to farmed oysters lasted just six weeks, compared with the previous, pre-tracking, outbreak in 2016-2017, which lasted five months.

Last year, Statistics Canada scooped the poop in five cities over 12 months to reveal cannabis and illicit drug use rates and patterns. The study exposed none of Victoria’s secrets, but it did out Halifax residents as the study’s top pot consumers. Montreal residents came in second and Toronto third. Vancouver and Edmonton ranked lower for weed use, but showed high meth and opiate use.

Cocaine use didn’t spike regionally, but the wastewater data suggested use of cocaine goes up in the summer, drops during the fall, then increases again in the winter.

Sewage epidemiologists have also plumbed what our behinds leave behind to glean information about the medications we take. Standard recommended-dose data allows the researchers to estimate how many people contributing to a sewage-collection system are taking birth control pills, antidepressants, antipsychotics, pain relievers, chemotherapy and so on. They can do this, because anything we eat that our bodies don’t metabolize and absorb flushes out the other end.

The information potential of our waste streams is immense. Consider how University of Washington researchers used whale poop to investigate resident-orca population health. They determined the sex, age and health of individual whales, as well as what and how much they were eating. The scientists also measured the animals’ reproductive, metabolic and stress hormone levels, and the amount and variety of parasites, environmental toxins, and hormone-disrupting chemicals the animals carried.

So many secrets could come to light thanks to what comes out of where the sun doesn’t shine.

Studying justice administration and police science in the mid-1980s provided an opportunity to explore criminal law, and my instructor at the time was Crown prosecutor Peter Martin, now an Alberta Court of Appeal justice.

Fast forward to Peel’s fifth principle of policing which is “to seek and to preserve public favour, not by catering to public opinion, but by constantly demonstrating absolute impartial service to the law.” That’s a tall order to fill, and police officers do their best to uphold this day in, day out, 24/7.

It’s quite likely, then, that the world of policing was where the saying “by the book,” really got traction. Police officers often refer to the Criminal Code of Canada, and other forms of legislation in the execution of their duties.

Police leaders and the officers who serve their communities are often found in a difficult spot as they regularly find themselves trying to separate policing from political issues.

According to this particular principle of policing, they must steer clear of catering to influence and maintain the law or risk being scrutinized by the public.

Can you imagine trying to keep various community groups and politicians happy all the time?

We are all equal when it comes to the law and it’s through this impartial service that the police sometimes find themselves under fire when politics and community concerns demand their attention. Policing policies are very structured, as are the laws that we are all bound by.

Therefore, issues such as drug decriminalization and homelessness become hot topics, often creating divisions like those we are now witnessing throughout our country and around the world.

In 2019, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry released a report on decriminalizing drug users in an effort to reduce opioid overdoses. There are many supporters, including the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, which recommends the simple possession of illicit drugs be decriminalized.

Many police officers support this movement, and yet are still bound to enforce drug laws. Premier John Horgan is also an avid supporter of the recommendation and recognizes that we’re in a health crisis, and that changes in legislation would allow police services to tackle other problems.

In Johann Hari’s book Chasing the Scream, he set out on a three-year, 30,000-mile journey into the war on drugs. What he found is that more and more people all over the world have begun to recognize three startling truths — drugs are not what we think they are, addiction is not what we think it is and the drug war has very different motives from those we have seen on TV screens for so long.

Homelessness is another crisis that the police find themselves in the thick of, and as several authors for the U.S. Urban Institute pointed out in a June 29 article, “addressing chronic homelessness through policing isn’t working. Housing First strategies are a better way.”

The authors go on to suggest that “people forced to endure chronic homelessness (experiencing homelessness for an extended period) are more likely to interact with the police and face citations, arrests and incarceration, trapping them in a homelessness-jail cycle.”

While there are certainly some differences between countries, the war on drugs and the ongoing challenges with homelessness are taxing on police services. Let’s remember that the police are bound to uphold the law, not pander to public opinion or political pressure. Reflect again on Peel’s first principle — their basic mission is to prevent crime and disorder.

Most of us recognize that we are at a crossroads, and that the police continue to be tasked with what many people would say is insurmountable.

It’s critical, then, that the public and the police do their utmost to demonstrate compassion towards our most vulnerable populations and that our politicians expedite new laws that release the pressure on police to enforce laws that are ultimately targeting citizens at risk.

An understanding of our situation must come from a combination of increased awareness, knowledge and discussion. One impact of the COVID-19 crisis is that many people are looking for an alternative way forward, as Guardian columnist George Monbiot noted in his July 25 column reporting on recent U.K. polls.

But as a society or community we are not even talking about what we are facing, except in the rather narrow sense of climate change.

While there is some evidence that we are slowly coming to grips with the reality of climate change, there are large and powerful pockets of resistance everywhere. Largely that resistance is rooted in and propagated by the fossil fuel industry and its ancillary industries, such as the automobile industry. It is then supported by the right-wing ideologues who are in thrall to corporate capitalism in general and the fossil fuel industry in particular.

Even when the situation is understood, there is still a vast gulf between our understanding and our intentions, and then between our intentions and our actions. Governments continue to support the fossil fuel industry, providing a wide range of subsidies.

Globally, this amounted to about $320 billion in 2019, according to the International Energy Agency.

Here in Canada, subsidies totalled at least $600 million in direct support from the federal government in 2019, according to the Winnipeg-based International Institute for Sustainable Development, and a lot more in unquantified tax breaks and incentives and in provincial subsidies.

Clearly, the message on climate change is not getting through. Small wonder we are on track to miss not only the ambitious 1.5 C target for global warming, but the 2 C target of the Paris Accords.

But there is far less understanding that climate change is but one of a number of massive and rapid global Earth system changes that we have created — all of them happening at the same time. On top of climate change, we continue to deplete natural resources such as ocean and freshwater fisheries, forests, fresh water, farmland and topsoils.

We continue to produce vast quantities of solid waste, especially plastics and paper, as well as liquid and gaseous wastes, leading to high levels of air and water pollution.

We continue to produce and widely disperse a vast array of pesticides and other toxic chemicals, many of them persistent, resulting in the contamination of soils and food chains.

Perhaps most seriously, we have triggered a sixth Great Extinction, with plummeting population counts in many species and growing rates of extinctions.

But since we depend on the Earth’s natural systems for the very basis of life and health, we are endangering ourselves as well as myriad other species.

If those natural systems start to collapse, or change rapidly, the social and economic implications are profoundly troubling.

Yet governments everywhere are not truly understanding the situation.

They don’t act as if this were the case, that we face a potential, indeed an actual existential crisis. In fact, we are barely even talking about it, as a community or a society.

We — or at least our governments — continue to pine for business as usual and plan for economic growth; they can’t wait for us to go roaring back — in Justin Trudeau’s unfortunate, but accurate, phrase — to how we were before COVID-19.

The urgent need to have widespread community conversations about what it means to be a region with a markedly reduced ecological footprint is why we recently registered Conversations for a One Planet Region as a non-profit organization in B.C.

The lack of an appropriate set of values is why our fall series will focus on what our guiding values should be and how we shift community and societal values.

I will discuss both our plans for expanding and deepening the understanding of our situation and the discussion of appropriate guiding values next week.

Initially this was bearable, or at any rate better than mowing the lawn. But the more of it you endure, the more irritating Hollywood clichés become.

article continues below

First, who came up with the idea that tough guys can project power by eating alone in the presence of subordinates?

For an example, see John Noble as Denothor in The Lord of the Rings, slobbering over his dinner while one of the hobbits looks on. (In passing, what should have been a first-class movie — actually a trilogy — was wrecked by directorial malpractice. Half the cast can’t act, and those who can are so intimidated by Peter Jackson’s insistence on canonical accuracy, they’re reduced to whispering their lines.)

Then, we have an infuriatingly prissy Jeremy Irons as the board chair in Margin Call, toying delicately with his lunch as Kevin Spacey, who has just fired half his staff, looks on mutely.

This doesn’t communicate authority. It communicates asking to get hit with a brick.

Next, there’s the apparent belief that having your star chew gum endlessly adds an element of edginess. No it doesn’t. It adds an element of the emetic.

See, for example, William Devane in the movie Space Cowboys, incessantly chawing like a demented rodent (as, to be fair, he does in most of his movies.)

Or more aggravatingly, Sam Shepard ruining a key scene in The Right Stuff where, playing test pilot Chuck Yeager, he climbs aboard the first aircraft to reach supersonic speeds.

All the time he’s masticating like a cow on crystal meth. I suppose that’s one way to break the sound barrier.

In passing, this, too, should have been one of the great movies of all time: Uniformly strong cast (unlike the pretty boys in Apollo 13), excellent special effects for the era and the unforgettable sight of massive rockets blasting off launch pads.

Yet all that is ruined by a director (Philip Kaufman) who fell in love with his project, and let it run to a yawn-inducing three hours.

Tinseltown notwithstanding, you don’t clean your teeth by sticking a toothbrush in your mouth, pursing your lips around it, and thrusting it in and out like a plumber wielding a roto-rooter. All that does is lubricate your tonsils.

More so, why the preoccupation with dental hygiene in movie after movie. Is this some kind of product placement by the American Association of Orthodontists?

Likewise, who’s impressed by a gangster with a gun in one hand and a lollipop in the other? I know. Telly Savalas got away with it in the TV series Kojak. But that should have been the end of it.

And while we’re at it, why has Hollywood yet to deliver a half-decent rendering of Alexandre Dumas’ masterpiece, The Three Musketeers? This was one of the great action/intrigue novels of the 19th century, arguably the first of its kind.

But although there have been at least half a dozen English language productions, they invariably descend into slapstick humour. See, for example (or better still, don’t see) the execrable 1948 version, with Gene Kelly turning in a clown act as d’Artagnan.

All right. This is admittedly a jaundiced view of things.

So what does a good film look like? Obviously it’s a matter of personal taste, but my vote goes to Michael Mann’s The Last of the Mohicans.

Everything about this classic is perfect. The opening scenes of mist-filled valleys reaching far into the distance create exactly the intended sense of a remote yet threat-filled land. (The movie was shot in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. It portrays the American frontier during the French and Indian wars of the 1760s.)

The cast are all first rate. Had there been any justice, Wes Studi would have won an Oscar for his portrayal of the Huron warrior Magua, the scariest bad guy you ever saw.

There are numerous settings of breathtaking beauty, like the shots of a young English officer coming by coach to meet his intended bride (she has other ideas.) The coach is filmed crossing a hump-backed bridge over a glass-smooth pool, all perfectly mirrored in the water below.

Although you know, pretty well, the ending in advance, the tension never lets up.

And surprisingly, a line from Rudyard Kipling creeps in, when Hawkeye, explaining why pioneer families dwell in this “defenceless” land, tells Cora: “Out here, they’re beholden to none. Not living by another’s leave.”

I say “surprisingly” because this leaf out of libertarian philosophy would never pass muster in Hollywood today.

Free that is, of fraudulent leadership which lacks respect for the truth, is quick to assign blame and slow to take responsibility.","We’ve learned a lot about leadership these past few weeks. Time to make sure we pass on what we’ve learned to the next generation as they near voting age.

Leadership, it has been said, occurs at the intersection of character and circumstance. We saw that demonstrated recently when Barack Obama spoke in eulogy to John Lewis and we see it here every day in B.C. as otherwise seemingly ordinary, albeit people well-qualified in their own areas, step up to provide the leadership, politically and medically, that shows us a path through crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.

They inspire us to follow that path, knowing that some might take that path less willingly than others.

We’ve also see the tragic effect of the abdication and subsequent absence of leadership which has an entire nation to the south of us in chaos.

The question is how, in an age of 24/7 “news” and unsubstantiated opinion from any number of pulpits, do we explain genuine leadership so that we can clarify its characteristics for our kids as they move into that next stage of their lives, when they will need to select leadership at the ballot box?

How, for example, do we teach them to distinguish between conscientious leaders and demagogues — responsible aspirants to public office and career tub thumpers?

How do we help our kids recognize the loud mouth and the empty vessel?

To begin with, we can explain, genuine leadership is difficult and requires a blend of integrity, clarity, decisiveness, the courage to speak up and, probably most important of all, humility.

Like being a good parent, a good teacher, even just a worthwhile member of a democratic culture, being a good leader is not easy.

Demagoguery, which requires few or none of the qualities of actual leadership, seeks support by appealing to the less worthy desires and prejudices of ordinary people, avoids rational argument, points fingers and assigns blame.

Leadership, the research tells us, requires integrity, judgement, competence and vision.

Successful leaders demonstrate these qualities in abundance and maintain their sense of purpose in the face of obstruction.

So what, do we tell our kids, are the distinguishing characteristics of those whose leadership is worth supporting?

Leadership researcher and high-performance transformational coach Andi Saitowitz, of the Adler Institute, identifies listening as being a “sine qua non” of leadership without which other qualities fade into insignificance.

“Active listening is all about really hearing others beyond what is said verbally. When people feel heard and validated, it makes them feel valued and, as a result, drives far better engagement,” Saitowitz says.

Leaders, in other words, accept the advice of authentic experts.

According to Saitowitz and others, true leaders never stop learning and see themselves as perpetual students. They stay curious and ask questions with an open mind and view the pursuit of continuous learning as a strategic asset.

Leaders, sometimes in the face of all evidence to the contrary, remain optimistic.

“Leaders who are optimistic believe they can create a positive future that is better than the present. They instil hope and faith in their people and serve as a shining light of possibility” she says.

And leaders deliver.

Demagogues tend to rely on fear of the unknown and suspicion of those who are different or whose philosophy differs from their own.

A mountain of research into leadership also points to emotional intelligence as an important factor which distinguishes leaders from demagogues.

Daniel Goleman, author and researcher on the brain and behavioural sciences, defines emotional intelligence as the ability to not only understand and rein in one’s own emotions but the ability to understand the emotions and behaviour of others.

As our kids move into this world of 24/7 news and sometimes bizarre opinion, the ability to spot trustworthy leadership and its qualities becomes more and more essential to preserving a free democracy. Free that is, of fraudulent leadership which lacks respect for the truth, is quick to assign blame and slow to take responsibility.

But enough of all that. It is not about leadership “up there” our kids need to recognize, but the qualities of everyday personal leadership which will shape that way our kids learn and live as they grow into adulthood; practice in decision-making, strategic and critical thinking, accountability and the ability to set goals and deadlines and “get things done.”

True, these are among the qualities we admire in genuine leaders, but they are also abilities and characteristics kids need to master for themselves in their day to day lives; not to quit at the first sign of difficulty; to expect to face challenges and understand that resilience is a skill that can be developed over time to deal with inevitable bumps in the road.

Leadership, we will tell our kids, begins with you.

Neither Cassirer's heirs nor Spain's Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum dispute the painting's early history.
Both U.S. District Judge John Walter, in a 2019 ruling, and the appeals court in Tuesday's, criticized the baron and the Spanish foundation for not doing more to discover whether the painting was looted art.
Both courts also criticized Spain for not living up to what the courts called ""moral commitments"" to return Nazi-looted art.
But that is the state of the law,"" the appeals court said in its ruling.","LOS ANGELES — A U.S. appeals court has ruled that a Camille Pissarro painting a Jewish woman traded to the Nazis to escape the Holocaust in 1939 may remain the property of a Spanish museum that acquired it more than a half-century later.

The unanimous ruling issued Monday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest — but possibly not the last — in a case that has wound through the courts of Spain and the United States for 20 years.

article continues below

At stake is ""La Rue St. Honoré, effet de Soleil, Après-Midi, 1898,"" an oil-on-canvas work of a rain-swept Paris street that Pissarro painted as he gazed at the scene from his hotel window. Its value has been estimated at $30 million.

Lilly Cassirer’s father-in-law bought it directly from Pissarro’s art dealer and left it to her and her husband when he died. In 1939, she traded it to the Nazis in exchange for exit visas for herself, her husband and her grandson, who eventually settled in the U.S. Her great-grandson, David Cassirer of San Diego, has continued the litigation since his father's death.

Neither Cassirer's heirs nor Spain's Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum dispute the painting's early history.

What's at issue all these years later is whether Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza made any serious effort to determine the painting was looted art when he acquired it from a New York gallery owner for $275,000 in 1976.

Also whether Spanish curators did their due diligence in tracing its provenance when a Spanish non-profit foundation acquired it and hundreds of other paintings from the baron's collection in 1992 and created the Madrid museum that bears his name.

Lilly Cassirer’s heirs say she spent years trying to recover the painting before concluding it was lost and accepting $13,000 in reparations from the German government in 1958.

It wasn’t until 1999 that her grandson, Claude, who had vividly recalled seeing it hanging in the family's German home, discovered it in the Madrid museum. After Spain refused to hand it over, he sued.

Attorney Thaddeus Stauber, who has represented the museum since the case reached U.S. courts in 2005, hailed Monday's decision, noting that the painting was sold and resold to numerous legitimate and prominent collectors over the years before the baron obtained it, with none discovering it had been seized by the Nazis.

He said there also appeared to be no effort by Thyssen-Bornemisza or any other collector to hide it from the public.

""We've been transparent from the start of this case, and we're very pleased that there's been a trial now and it brings it to a conclusion, we trust,"" he said Tuesday.

He did say the Cassirer family may appeal to the full 9th Circuit or even the U.S. Supreme Court.

The family did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday, but the president of the Holocaust Survivors Foundation USA denounced the decision.

""The Nazis murdered more than 6 million Jews, including 1.5 million children under the age of 12, and including 105 members of my family,"" David Schaecter said. ""How on God’s Earth can Spain fight so hard to deny a Jewish family its precious legacy that was looted by the Nazis? And how on God’s Earth can an American court ignore the unprecedented trauma of the Holocaust and reward Spain for its greed?""

Both U.S. District Judge John Walter, in a 2019 ruling, and the appeals court in Tuesday's, criticized the baron and the Spanish foundation for not doing more to discover whether the painting was looted art. But both courts concluded there was no proof either deliberately hid that it was.

Both courts also criticized Spain for not living up to what the courts called ""moral commitments"" to return Nazi-looted art.

""It is perhaps unfortunate that a country and a government can preen as moralistic in its declarations, yet not be bound by those declarations. But that is the state of the law,"" the appeals court said in its ruling."

""Find out more about what your school district is doing, and then adjust according to that.","TORONTO — Vonny Sweetland has yet to decide if he will be sending his 12-year-old sister Josephine back to class in September, but just in case he does, he's been stocking up on supplies for months.

He picks up hand sanitizer when he sees it in stores, grabbed new masks last month, bought a fresh uniform and has been testing out Josephine's muscle power with some new lunch containers.

The new additions to her backpack and are all part of a wave of changes families — and their wallets — are being confronted with as they prepare for back to school, whether it's sourcing protective equipment or choosing a thermos their child can open unassisted.

""In a COVID-era, all of these things we take for granted or think are minuscule are actually really important,"" said Sweetland, who is his sister's guardian.

""These are things as simple as a teacher helping you unpack your lunch or zipping a zipper. To prevent potential spread, I don't think teachers are really going to be doing these things.""

The cost of so many new supplies can easily add up.

A Deloitte survey of 1,200 parents who have at least one child attending school in grades K-12 this fall found the average family will spend $102 on school supplies, $216 on clothing and accessories, $395 on computers and hardware, $316 on electronic gadgets and digital subscriptions.

The survey, which was conducted between May and July, found those families will allocate $61 on a new category: home or health supplies.

Even so, back-to-school shopping doesn't have to be more expensive than any other year, said Seung Hwan (Mark) Lee, an associate professor of retail management at Ryerson University.

He recommends shoppers compare prices and take advantage of sales.

Anne Marie Taber said she's noticed plenty of sales, though she hasn't sought them out when shopping with seven-year-old daughter Avery because she tries to minimize her time in stores and instead use online options with delivery to lessen her exposure to the virus.

She stocked up as soon as she could on Old Navy's uniform-style clothing because several sizes were out of stock and also grabbed Avery a new backpack.

On top of masks and hand sanitizers, they bought a wide-mouth water bottle without a straw to make cleaning easy, plastic Duo-Tangs that can be wiped down and a set of art supplies that Avery has been reminded not to share.

""This is extra stuff we haven't had to buy in the past but it's a small dollar to pay to make sure that that is just hers exclusively,"" Taber said.

Parents may also want to consider disposable cutlery, if they have children that bring lunches to school and are worried about germs spreading through anything reuseable, Lee said.

If your child is doing virtual classes, he suggests ensuring you have a reliable laptop or tablet with a webcam.

Those who want to go all out or are older and have specific needs for programs they are enrolled in, may need to think about microphones and speakers too.

Those supplies don't come cheap. However, the cost of those high-ticket items could be partially offset by a change he sees happening across universities and colleges during the pandemic.

""It's no longer really about carrying around the heavy textbooks,"" he said.

""Many professors aren't holding lengthy exams because the exams are becoming very difficult to monitor and you can't really get a proctor to look at how students are conducting their exams... so using test banks or textbooks no longer apply.""

If you're feeling anxious or stressed about back to school shopping and advertisements are making you feel you better get to a store soon, Lee says not worry.

""I would advise parents right now not to rush into getting supplies,"" he said.

""Find out more about what your school district is doing, and then adjust according to that. A deal can always be had.""

Each summer, the former U.S. president unveils a selection of his favourite songs of the season.

Most of the artists are household names, but Obama often leaves room to showcase a few lesser-known acts, much to their surprise.

Shauf says he learned about his placement when a listener tagged him on Instagram shortly after Obama revealed the playlist on social media.

""It's cool to think that Obama, or the Obamas together, have listened to my music,"" he said.

""It's a really nice feeling to think my music has gone that far.""

""Neon Skyline"" is a particularly Canadian song choice because its story unravels inside the Skyline Restaurant, a real-life diner in Toronto's Parkdale neighbourhood, where two friends agree to meet for a beer shortly before one runs into his ex.

Shauf, who was born in Regina, said he frequented the Skyline when he moved to Toronto several years back

""It became a really friendly place to hang out and the setting for my record,"" he said.

Shauf has been a critical favourite in Canada for years. He was nominated for multiple Juno Awards, and ""The Neon Skyline"" landed on the long list of Polaris Prize contenders for this year's best album.

Fellow Canadian artists Drake and PartyNextDoor also showed up on Obama's list.

Both of them shared billing on Popcaan's track ""Twist & Turn,"" while Drake was also featured for his part on Rihanna's megahit ""Work.""

PartyNextDoor, who is Mississauga, Ont.-raised rapper Jahron Brathwaite, made a second appearance for his solo effort ""PGT,"" taken from his 2020 album, ""Partymobile.""

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

article continues below

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister.
""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.
""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.
MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.","OTTAWA — Chrystia Freeland shattered a glass ceiling Tuesday, becoming the first woman to be sworn in as Canada's finance minister.

The gravitas of the moment was not lost on the former journalist and mother of three. After she spoke the English words of her oath of office, she paused to take a deep breath, before repeating the oath in French.

article continues below

""It's about time,"" Freeland said later at a press conference on Parliament Hill.

She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.

Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.

But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.

""There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,"" said Turnbull. ""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.""

Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.

She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.

""We don't like their representative very much,"" he said of her in September 2018.

Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said ""Mama (does not equal) chopped liver."" On the back it said ""Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.""

When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.

And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.

""She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,"" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.

He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.

""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.

""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.

""I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,"" he said. ""And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.""

She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.

""What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,"" Kelly said on Twitter. ""This has been missing in the department for several years.""

MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.

While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.

Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.

The Nisga'a Lisims government said Tuesday that Gosnell died in his home in New Aiyansh after a long battle with cancer.

Gosnell was a hereditary Nisga'a chieftain of the Eagle Clan and was president of the nation when it finalized a landmark treaty in 2000 that gave the First Nation control over its land including forestry and fishing rights. It was the first modern-day treaty signed in B.C. since the 1800s.

Nisga'a Nation president Eva Clayton said Gosnell's wisdom, dignity and determination helped lead the First Nation into self-government over its territory northeast of Prince Rupert.

""Today, we have lost a giant,"" Clayton said in a statement. ""His legacy will help shape the project of reconciliation for generations to come.""

Gosnell was a recipient of the Order of Canada, the Order of B.C. and held an honorary doctorate of laws from Royal Roads University in Victoria.

He is survived by his wife of 64 years, Audrey, their seven children and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Gosnell grew up in the Nass River Valley in B.C.'s northwest. He worked as a commercial fisherman, carpenter and traditional carver before he was elected as a band councillor and chief of the Gitlaxt'aamiks Band, one of the Nisga'a village governments.

Gosnell was appointed chancellor of the University of Northern B.C. last year and served until his death.

University interim president Geoffrey Payne said Gosnell's dedication to education was evident during his time as chancellor.

""The world has lost a tremendous leader, a man who repeatedly demonstrated a love for his community, his people, education and a commitment to enhancing the lives of others,"" Payne said in a statement.

Clayton said Gosnell's work to negotiate the Nisga'a Treaty produced a ""beacon of hope"" for people around the world.

""His focus was always on what the Nisga'a, British Columbians and Canadians can achieve together,"" she said.

When a bill to accept the treaty was introduced in the legislature in December 1998, Gosnell told the house the agreement proved to the world that reasonable people can sit down and settle historical wrongs.

""It's a triumph because under the treaty, we will no longer be wards of the state, no longer beggars in our own land. It's a triumph because under the treaty, we will collectively own approximately 2,000 square kilometres of land, far exceeding the postage-stamp reserve set aside for us by colonial governments.""

He said the treaty proved that negotiations — not lawsuits, blockades or violence — are the most effective and honourable way to resolve Aboriginal issues.

""It's a triumph, I believe, that signals the end of the Indian Act, the end of more than a century of humiliation, degradation and despair for the Nisga'a Nation.""

Premier John Horgan said in a tweet that everyone can learn from Gosnell's legacy of working to make life better for people and he'll be missed.

""He was instrumental in helping the Nisga'a chart a new path of self-governance through BC's first modern treaty.""

The nation said funeral arrangements will be announced by the family.

The BC Wildfire Service said crews are responding to the fire on Christie Mountain about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, on the east side of Skaha Lake.

The fire is estimated at 250 hectares and firefighters on the ground are being supported by air tankers.

The service said the situation was ""rapidly evolving"" and asked everyone to stay clear of the area to avoid interfering with the operation.

The order asks residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with pets and critical items.

""We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,"" the service said in a tweet.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a ""fire of note"" on Tuesday.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was smouldering with no open flame but was considered out of control. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight.

Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Firefighters have tackled dozens of wildfires after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions.

Two fires were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada has estimated returning sockeye would hit a record low this year, with about 283,000 fish or fewer making it from the ocean to their Fraser River spawning grounds.

Just last month, the department estimated 941,000 sockeye would return, though it noted salmon forecasts were highly uncertain, in part because of a lack of understanding of the effects of warming ocean waters.

The council, made up of the B.C. Assembly of First Nations, the First Nations Summit and Union of B.C. Indian chiefs, says Indigenous communities that rely on the salmon for food face the greatest impacts, but the department has consistently prioritized commercial fishing.

Representatives with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans were not immediately available for comment.

First Nations fishing rights are protected by the Constitution and the council says the federal government has failed in its duty to ensure they have priority access to salmon.

Robert Phillips with the First Nations Summit says Indigenous leaders have been calling on Ottawa to save the salmon for decades and it's time for full jurisdiction over salmon stocks to be transferred back to First Nations.

Five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations on Vancouver Island have also accused federal fisheries officials of systemic racism after the government decided to exclude them in the allocation of 15,000 extra salmon this year — a surplus that arose because fewer people were fishing recreationally during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Salmon returning to the Fraser River also face the added hurdle of making it over a massive landslide along a remote stretch of the river north of Lillooet.

A pneumatic pump and tube system and the construction of a fish ladder have been installed to help salmon over the five-metre waterfall created by the slide.

In an update last week, Fisheries and Oceans said water levels have dropped sufficiently in recent days to allow fish to pass over the slide on their own steam.

A Department of Fisheries document from 2017 says total adult returns of Fraser River sockeye are highly variable ranging from 2 to 28 million, with an average of 9.6 million, between 1980 and 2014.

In documents filed by her court-appointed lawyer that give a rare public airing to the wishes of the 38-year-old pop superstar, she asked that her father not return to the role of conservator of her person, which gave him power over her major life decisions from 2008 until 2019, when he temporarily stepped aside, citing health problems.

article continues below

""Britney is strongly opposed to James return as conservator of her person,"" the document says.

James Spears has kept his separate role as conservator over his daughter's finances. For the first 11 years of the conservatorship, he served as co-conservator with attorney Andrew M. Wallet, who resigned from the role early last year.

That briefly left James Spears with sole power over Britney Spears' life, money and career, a situation she says she very much wants to avoid repeating.

An email seeking comment from James Spears' attorney was not immediately returned.

Spears says she wants Jodi Montgomery, who has been serving as conservator of her person temporarily, to do so permanently, but she says that doesn't mean she is waiving her right to seek an end to the entire arrangement.

The documents also reveal that Britney Spears has no plans to perform again anytime soon. She last performed live in October 2018, and early in 2019, cancelled a planned Las Vegas residency.

The filing gave a rare glimpse at Britney Spears' own wishes in the conservatorship that has had vast power over her for over a decade. She has almost never spoken publicly about the matter, and court hearings and documents in the case are cloaked in secrecy, though last year she addressed the court at her request, suggesting she was seeking changes.

In the papers, Britney Spears praises the conservatorship and its work overall, saying it ""rescued her from a collapse, exploitation by predatory individuals and financial ruin"" and that it made her ""able to regain her position as a world class entertainer.""

The document was filed a day before a status hearing on the conservatorship, expected to be closed to the media and public.

Britney Spears' attorney said that he expects James Spears will aggressively contest being marginalized, and said that Britney Spears has suggested they retain a lawyer with expertise in complex financial court fights.

The conservatorship, known in some states as a guardianship, gave James Spears power over his daughter's career choices and much of her personal life, including her relationship with her teenage sons. Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline has custody of the boys, but she has frequent visits with them.

When you are The Killers and your usual guitarist has gone, no problem. When you’re The Killers you can turn to Lindsey Buckingham.

article continues below

The former Fleetwood Mac guitarist steps in for a tune on the new 10-song ""Imploding the Mirage,"" another sign of the band’s clout. The album's guests also include k.d. lang and Adam Granduciel of The War on Drugs.

The absence of guitarist and co-founder Dave Keuning is felt, with keyboards and drums stepping into the void. Without Keuning’s jangle and riff shards, The Killers have a more poppy sound.

If 2017's ""Wonderful Wonderful"" was a meditation on the anxiety of masculinity, the new album often explores the lives of women, with two sharp portraits of tough survivors in ""Blowback"" and ""Caution"" — women whom Brandon Flowers sings each come from ""white trash.""

Many other songs are about loyally backing a partner. ""I’ll be there when water’s rising/I’ll be your lifeguard,"" Flowers sings on ""Dying Breed."" On ""When the Dreams Run Dry,"" he vows: ""I’ll be on your side/When the dreams run dry."" In ""Lightening Fields,"" he sings, ""Just wanted to run my fastest/And stand beside you."" The cover of the album depicts a god tenderly supporting a goddess.

Jonathan Rado of California psychedelic-rock duo Foxygen and Shawn Everett — who worked on ""Wonderful Wonderful"" as well as with Kacey Musgraves and Alabama Shakes — have stepped in to produce and their influence can best be heard on the funky ""Fire in Bone.""

Elsewhere, listeners may have fun finding the band's other influences. There's a Tom Petty-ish sound to ""Blowback"" and ""My Own Soul's Warning"" has a Springsteen vibe. But there's no mistaking that classic Killers mix of soaring vocals, sonic bombast and sly humour in such songs as ""My God"" and the title track. It's a solid album from a band still exploring.

""This is me. I am 'Pipe Nation,'"" she said with a laugh Monday during an interview with The Canadian Press in Sundre, Alta., a picturesque oil town nestled near the Rocky Mountains.

article continues below

""I've been working in the oil and gas industry for about six years. I took a break when the bust happened and did a little serving, a little bartending but always went back to the oil and gas,"" added Gamble, who is 24.

""My father, my grandfather and my great grandfather were all in the oil and gas industry as well.""

Sundre is set to become the fictional community of Hardwell. The drama will focus on day-to-day hardships labourers face, with Gamble's character as the leader of a pipe gang — workers who position and align the pipe, preparing it for the weld. In real life, Gamble has held a number of jobs in the industry including welding.

But this is her first acting part since middle school.

""I always wanted to become an actor because I always thought pretending to be someone and falling into a character is a lot of fun and being someone else,"" she said.

""Unfortunately that's not the direction I went to until now when I got handed this beautiful opportunity that my little-girl dream could come true.""

Filmmaker and director Raoul Bhatt says he wanted a mix of both professional and amateur actors on set, and he's not concerned about the lack of experience from some of his cast members. He sees it as an asset to the project.

""I needed this to be believable and I needed someone with a certain language, a certain grit, combined with people who have actor experience,"" said Bhatt, adding 480 people showed up for the casting call. ""I wanted someone who's believable, honest, sincere and lives in the moment.""

Bhatt, who grew up in Edmonton, has a soft spot for the energy sector and says the show is meant to spotlight the colourful nature of the individuals.

""They're just beautiful people and to showcase that beyond the Dow Jones, beyond just the oil and gas numbers to human struggle, conditions and overcoming adversity and the determination of these characters is what the show is about,"" he said.

Bhatt, a software engineer who self-funded the pilot, has worked as a cinematographer and producer for the Daytime Emmys, as well as with Universal Studios' ""Jurassic World"" and a number of music videos.

He understands there are plenty of people out there who are not fans of the oil and gas industry.

""We are leaning toward pro but again that's for the viewer to decide. If you're against the oil and gas industry that's your opinion but I really hope this creates an emotional connection with the characters.""

Filming of the pilot will be completed by the end of August. Bhatt said he is in negotiations with a couple of streaming services for a 10-episode season.

A storage lot for oilfield equipment in Sundre is one of the regular sets. In addition, a portion of farmland in Sundre has been cleared for the actual building of a mini pipeline to add to the realism of the show.

Bhatt isn't short on technical advisers. Gin Ford, who plays the character Dee, has been a pipeline welder for the past 10-plus years. She has no acting experience but intends to use the show as a vessel for female empowerment and women in the energy industry.

""I'm not here for fame or recognition. I am actually here to make a voice for women in trades. Here's the moment for me to be a voice,"" said Ford.

""I've been called the pipeline princess and it's like, you can roll onto site and right way it's 'this girl's out here to work?'"" she said.

""I definitely want to highlight you can look like you want and you can still work in a male-dominated industry. It doesn't matter if you've got the nails, the lashes, the hair or the Barbie image.""

Ford said the show is meant to be raw, but it's not reality TV or a documentary.

""I'm not going to lie. My mom's probably going to tell me to wash my mouth out with some soap,"" Ford said, noting her character is tough-talking, confident and keeps up with the guys.

Mike Vickers plays Ryan, an East Coaster who moved to Alberta to make his fortune in the oil industry. Art imitates life for Vickers who moved to Alberta from Cape Breton.

""When I read the script it was my life. I fell in love with this. It's going to really showcase that true oil and gas grit, the struggles we all face and how we overcome it together as a family,"" Vickers said.

""There's so much opportunity to better the image of this industry and it's how we all come together is how we're going to do this and tell this story.""

Filming in Sundre is expected to wrap up by Aug. 24 and will finish in Nisku, south of Edmonton, by the end of the month.

Michelaine Lahaie, chair of the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for RCMP, says a video shows an RCMP officer opening the door of a moving police vehicle, which hits the man.

The officer and other Mounties then use force to arrest him while he's on the ground.

Lahaie says the man was then injured in an alleged assault by another detained man in a cell at the Kinngait RCMP detachment and had to be flown to Iqaluit for medical treatment.

She says the investigation is to determine whether the conduct of the Mounties, including use of force, was reasonable.

She says in a news release that the probe will be a Public Interest Investigation into the conduct of RCMP in Kinngait.

""The RCMP members' conduct will be assessed in accordance with relevant law and RCMP policy,"" reads the terms of reference of the investigation released Tuesday.

""Consideration will also be given as to whether racial bias and/or discrimination played a role in the man's arrest and subsequent treatment.""

Lahaie noted the review she has requested by the commission is separate from an investigation by the Ottawa Police Service at the request of the Mounties and an RCMP internal Code of Conduct review.

""I am concerned with the conduct of RCMP members involved in this serious incident and will monitor both the OPS (Ottawa police) investigation and the RCMP's Code of Conduct investigation,"" Lahaie said in a release.

""The CRCC's investigation will provide an added level of scrutiny to the incident, as it will additionally examine the circumstances that led to the man being placed in a cell at the RCMP detachment where another detainee assaulted him and he needed to be airlifted to Iqaluit for treatment.

""I am aware that there is historical distrust by Inuit toward the police and I am committed to increasing RCMP accountability.""

The day after the man's arrest Nunavut Justice Minister Jeannie Ehaloak said she was outraged.

""I have seen the video from Kinngait circulating on social media and am very concerned by the unnecessary force, the violence and the lack of respect I have seen,'' she said in a release at the time.

""Nunavummiut should not fear this kind of treatment and disregard for safety and basic rights.''

Ehaloak said she would formally request a review by the commission.

The Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the Mounties was created to ensure that public complaints made about the conduct of RCMP members are examined fairly and impartially.

Here is what that means and what could come next.

Word — The term comes through Middle English and Old French from a Latin root, prorogare, to prolong.

article continues below

Effect — Prorogation essentially ends a session of Parliament, allowing for a new beginning with a speech from the throne.

Legislation — At one time, prorogation killed all legislation before Parliament, but rule changes now provide that most bills can be revived in the new session at the same stage they were at when the previous session ended.

Committees — Committees, including special and legislative committees, cease to exist. Membership on committees, except the membership of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, is terminated and all chairs and vice-chairs no longer hold these positions.

Documents — No document may be tabled until the first day of a new session.

Quote — ""Prorogation of a session brings to an end all proceedings before Parliament. With certain exceptions, unfinished business 'dies' on the Order Paper and must be started anew in a subsequent session."" — House of Commons Procedure and Practice, Third Edition, 2017.

Length — Prorogation can be as short as a few hours, or as long as several months. During this period, the House of Commons and Senate are shut down but the government remains in power and MPs remain MPs.

Frequency — Most Parliaments are prorogued at least once and often there are several prorogations and sessions in the life of a Parliament.

Authority — Prorogation is ordered by the Governor General on the advice of the prime minister. It is not covered by statute. Rather it is a personal legal power of the Governor General and by convention the prime minister has the right to provide advice. And by convention it's actually the prime minister's decision.

Granted — Prorogation is routinely granted. In December 2008, then-governor general Michaelle Jean took a few hours before granting prorogation, but that was a thorny case because opposition parties were threatening to defeat the government and install a coalition government shortly after an election.

Ceremony — At one time, prorogation was done in a formal ceremony in the Senate chamber, but that hasn't been used in decades. A simple proclamation signed by the Governor General does the trick today.

Liberal promise — In their 2015 election platform, the Liberals said Stephen Harper's Conservatives ""used prorogation to avoid difficult political circumstances. We will not.""

Limits — Governments can't use prorogation to shut down Parliament indefinitely. That would violate the constitutional requirement that Parliament meet at least once every 12 months. And without Parliament to approve a budget and spending estimates, the government would run out of money.

The five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations are upset that Ottawa decided to give a surplus allocation of salmon — which arose this year due to reduced recreational fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic — to commercial fishers rather than to the First Nations.

Clifford Atleo, lead negotiator for one of the nations who is also called Wickaninnish, says he feels sports and commercial troll fishers are given more rights to fish in the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

He says the latest decision to shut First Nations fishers out of an opportunity to catch more chinook salmon this year shows systemic racism is ""alive and well"" within the federal fisheries department.

""We feel very strongly we're not being dealt with fairly, we know we're not being dealt with fairly,"" Atleo said.

""It's just another layer of disappointment on the part of how the government deals with us. The government doesn't realize that their attitude toward our people is dyed-in-the-wool ... And I think the government — sometimes they don't realize they're being racist. They've got age-old policies that have never changed.""

A 2018 B.C. Supreme Court ruling directed Ottawa to take a more ""generous approach"" to allocations of chinook salmon to the First Nations given the importance of this species to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people.

The ruling from B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Humphries noted that the government's salmon allocation policy at the time gave recreational fisherman priority to fish for chinook and soho salmon ahead of the First Nations and advised the fisheries minister to reassess this policy.

Despite this ruling and changes that have since placed the First Nations at a higher priority than sport fishers, the Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ehattesaht and Mowachaht/Muchalaht nations say their yearly fishing allocations have not increased.

This year, the five First Nations were told they could fish 7,724 chinook, which amounts to just 1.5 fish per person for the 5,000 members of their communities.

COVID-19 brought a new dynamic to the salmon allocations this year, as fewer sport fishers were able to come due to pandemic restrictions. This means the recreational fleet is expected to catch 15,000 less salmon than was forecasted for this year, according to figures provided by the department.

None of this surplus is going to the First Nations.

""As per approved management plans, the Area G (commercial) harvest is adjusted based on the projected recreational harvests which results in an increase of 15,000 for 2020,"" said department spokesperson Athina Vazeos.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan was unavailable for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Jennifer Kuss, noted the improvements made in giving the five nations a higher priority in the yearly salmon catch allocations, as directed by the courts.

""This change ensures that food, social, and ceremonial (fishing) continues to be prioritized first, and additionally prioritizes the Five Nations rights-based sale fishery over the recreational and commercial fishery,"" Kuss said in a statement.

The Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations argue Ottawa could have provided some of the unused catch from this year to their people to help them support their remote communities. But Atleo said fisheries officials would not even engage in discussions about it.

""The government is trying to say they consult with us, they negotiate with us. They create their fishing plans, put it on the table and it's like take or leave it,"" Atleo said.

""All we want to do is be part of the economy, part of looking after ourselves without depending on government. We don't think that's a lot to ask.""

NDP MP Gord Johns, whose riding takes in the West Coast fishing shores, said he finds it ""disgusting"" the Trudeau government has repeatedly highlighted its desire to restore the Crown's relationship with Indigenous Peoples but has still fought many legal battles with these nations over their fishing rights.

""Indigenous people in our communities rely on this fishery for their economy, for their food security, for their culture. It's part of their way of life. These are salt water people and they rely on the salmon and to be denied their right is shameful, it's disgusting that the government is taking this approach.""

The First Nations are calling on Ottawa to revisit its decision on the surplus salmon for this year to allow them a portion of the additional catch.

""The government has an opportunity to fix this with these (surplus salmon) to come with a fair opportunity to exercise their commitment, in the judge's words, for a generous allocation to the nations and to start moving forward with reconciliation,"" Johns said.

The minister's spokeswoman says Jordan takes any allegations of systemic racism ""very seriously"" and that Ottawa is working with the five nations on a reconciliation agreement on fisheries resources, which is intended to broaden their access in the area, Kuss said.

""The road to reconciliation is a long journey, and Canada is committed to moving forward together. The department has spoken with the five nations on the reallocation of (salmon catch) on multiple occasions and that open dialogue will continue.""

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

""It was nice to get on the board tonight,"" said O'Reilly.

""I haven't been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it's just one game. I've got to be consistent with it.""

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

""When we take care of the puck it's effective and it's hard on them,"" said O'Reilly.

""I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We've got to stick to our structure.""

Pietrangelo said they've been working on fixing the penalty kill.

""We've been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,"" he said.

""Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.""

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

""They're blocking a lot of shots, they're studying us. They kind of know what we're doing,"" said Miller.

He said they'll make adjustments but aren't going to go back to square one.

""We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,"" he said.

""It's not like we're getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They're a good team. We're a good team. It's going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.""

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O'Reilly, last year's Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play — the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O'Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O'Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler's stick and in.

O'Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

All Western Conference games are being played in front of no fans at Rogers Place. The players are being kept isolated in a so-called bubble between games to prevent contracting COVID-19.

They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club.","TORONTO — Richard Clune remembers the drive — the pain, the anxiety, the uncertainty, the fear.

It was the spring of 2010 and Clune, who had made his NHL debut earlier that season, was finally on the road to getting the help the 23-year-old knew he needed in his crippling addiction battle.

article continues below

With his younger brother, Matt, at the wheel, they drove through upstate New York in a torrential downpour home to Toronto. Clune wasn't sure he was going to make it.

""I was in the acute withdrawal phase,"" he said in a recent interview with The Canadian Press. ""I couldn't sit still for a second. The most logical thing at that point in time for me was to go jump off a bridge ... literally.

""I couldn't really see myself coming out of it.""

But come out of it he did, and a decade later, Clune is sharing his story in ""Hi, My Name is Dicky,"" a raw documentary available on iTunes and AppleTV that details his life from aspiring youth hockey player to out-of-control junior antagonist to pro athlete teetering on the edge — one consumed by drugs, alcohol and mental illness.

His journey to recovery started in earnest on that lonely stretch of highway.

""My brother really had to talk me off the ledge,"" Clune said. ""When I see his face and when I see my other brother Ben's face, that's what gave me strength to live, because I didn't really want to live for myself at that time.

""Matt, at a couple points on that drive, had to do things that no younger brother should have to do and really dig down deep and get me home.""

The documentary from Taylor Prestidge and Haris Usanovic of Upper Canada Films tracks Clune's life and career, recovery and redemption. It includes interviews with Clune's parents, brothers, teammates and coaches.

Clune was driven to be the best as a child, but the pressure led him down a dark path at early age.

""I made that decision I was going to put my head down and not see anything but being a hockey player,"" Clune, who was selected in the third round of the 2005 NHL draft by the Dallas Stars, says in the film.

He began to try alcohol in his early teens as a way to cope, and it escalated quickly once he got to high school and then the Ontario Hockey League.

""I had this hole inside me that made me insecure and afraid of the world,"" Clune recounts. ""I got wasted and was like, 'Wow. OK. I'll be able to do this. I can cope with this. It's like a warm blanket.'

""Alcohol saved me. It was my solution to that problem of being self-absorbed and focused on all the things that made me insecure and self-conscious and in pain and sad.""

But he didn't realize how much of a spiral his life was taking. In junior, he would drive from bar to bar, party to party, drinking, smoking marjiuana and doing cocaine.

""I wanted to walk that line of looking death in the face every day, but still play hockey and do all these things,"" Clune says in the film. ""I don't know how I did it.""

Things got worse after junior when he was living in the United States by himself before making his NHL debut in that fateful 2009-10 season, months before becoming completely unglued.

""I had achieved my goal,"" he recalls on screen. ""But I hated myself.""

Clune eventually checked into rehab a second time — he went once before, but didn't stay — and committed to getting better with a lot of help from the people around him.

After he got out, he resumed his career and went onto play a total of 120 regular-season games in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Nashville Predators. His contract was bought out in 2015, and he was again at a crossroads — retire or keep going.

That's when the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were in the early stages of their massive rebuild, came calling to see if Clune wanted to be part of their program. They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club. At the very least, he would play in the minors and help foster a new culture.

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, who was in charge of the minor-league Marlies at the time, saw something in Clune that could be useful.

""He provides a certain energy,"" Dubas said. ""He provides experience in his life that I thought brought a great spirit to our team.""

Clune played 19 games with Leafs, but the forward truly made his mark with the Marlies. He helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018 and plans to continue his on-ice career, but equally important was how he's helped mentor a number of current NHLers.

He's proud of where he is, and not shy talking about how he got there. Clune still goes to meetings, does the 12 steps and now works to help others.

He also thinks a lot about why he made the decision to live, to fight, and get better, when many others — including some fellow pro hockey players — have gone down a different path.

""In the beginning, it was because I wanted to see my brothers,"" said Clune, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Then it transformed into wanting to live for myself. I started to discover what it feels like to have self esteem and to have love.

""I just hope people realize that they're not alone with how they feel. Don't be afraid to ask for help.""

And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""","Dale Hawerchuk, a hockey phenom who became the face of the Winnipeg Jets en route to the Hall of Fame, has died at the age of 57 after a battle with stomach cancer.

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

""After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,"" Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal's three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first overall by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

""A low-maintenance superstar,"" said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg's senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At five foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn't blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack of getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday. ""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League. I think it was Dale's arrival that really cemented the future of the franchise and I think we all have recollections of that first year, that Calder (Trophy) year and then everything that would follow.

""He was truly a superstar as a hockey player, but I think why he was so loved here was not just that but largely the fact that he made this his home and became one of us. I think everybody shared that sense of pride in Dale's career as a player.""

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: ""All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL's all time greatest players.""

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

""What an incredible human being,"" Selanne tweeted.

Montreal Canadiens associate coach Kirk Muller also had a chance to speak with Hawerchuk in recent days.

""I talked to Dale a few days ago, and we had a good chance to chat. A good friend, had a real good opportunity to play against one of the all-time best players. As a hockey player, we all know how great he was, but he was a good friend and just a really special person, did a lot for charities. It's a real loss for us in the hockey world.""

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk ""one of the most decorated players in our game's history.""

In September 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

""For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I'm ready to fight it,"" he told TSN in October 2019. ""I want to live to tell the story.""

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie's bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames players Andrew Mangiapane and Rasmus Andersson remembered playing for Hawerchuk in Barrie.

""I don't know where I'd be without him,"" said Mangiapane. ""Very sad news today. I owe my career basically to him and the whole Barrie organization.""

Andersson, from Sweden, said ""Dale was a fantastic human being. Such a great person. My first week in Barrie he invited us over to his house and really just welcomed me to Canada. I cannot say enough good things about him as a person. Obviously a real good coach, too.""

""It's awful news.""

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday's opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at age two and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur's record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

""I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive — well maybe a little further now with the traffic,"" he said. ""I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""

""I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,"" he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and '81 with teammates that included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL's top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt like he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year — the youngest recipient at the time — and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

""Just one of the greatest. You could tell from day one. We knew from when he was 18 years old as a player that he would turn the (Jets) franchise around. Certainly one of the best I’ve ever played with and coached,"" said Dallas Stars coach Rick Bowness, who played with and coached Hawerchuk in the '80s.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

""He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,"" said Mike Doran, Winnipeg's director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the faceoff in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux's famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

""It turned out fantastic,"" said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada's call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets ""are etched in my mind every day that I live.""

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes' ring of honour.

Hawerchuk re-wrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia whom he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

""It's like going back down memory lane,"" he said in his induction speech.

""All the experiences have been fantastic,"" he added. ""I mean, sometimes they didn't feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing ... Even though I didn't win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn't change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.""

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets' Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November 2017.

""Tonight we fly Ducky's number high,"" said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue's ""Home Sweet Home,"" before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

""Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,"" said the PA announcer.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

""I've been to every part of (Manitoba), either golfing or playing (softball),"" Hawerchuk said. ""I've gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I'm honoured and I'm very humbled.""

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.

And that includes how to allow players under contract to CFL teams the ability to sign elsewhere — most notably the NFL — if the opportunity arises. On Monday, the CFL cancelled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The focus right now for us on a few certain things and one of them is ensuring if there's an ability for our players to receive some form of payment this year,"" Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA's executive director, said Monday during a conference call. ""They should be able to do that if they have an opportunity.""

While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season. However, 66 players have currently opted out of participating in the 2020 campaign, which could create opportunity for some CFL players to sign deals south of the border and have a chance to earn a football paycheque, either on the active roster or on the practice squad.

While there's no shortage of collegiate players available, the advantage a CFL player has is pro experience, a fact not lost upon NFL personnel people.

The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign. This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.

And players on NFL practice rosters receive at least US$8,000 per week.

Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the CFL is amendable to doing what it can to help its players.

""Where we can do something we will,"" he said. ""We're going to be committed to working towards good outcomes, the best possible outcomes we can have with out players.

""That's not going to mean we're going to be able to do everything but we're certainly going to go into this with a real positive spirit.""

Something else that will be on the CFL-CFLPA radar will be the current collective bargaining agreement, which is slated to expire after the 2021 season. But union president Solomon Elimimian said the two sides covered a lot of ground this time around during talks to amend the agreement for a shortened '20 season.

""Whether we deal with '21 when it comes or after the '21 season I think there's hope there that we can work together,"" Elimimian said. ""Obviously the relationship between the players and the league needs to be one where the players feel appreciated.

""Everyone wants to the league to reach its full potential. The partnership has to be one that's very genuine and the players have to feel part of that. If that happens, the sky is the limit.""

Cavan Biggio also went deep for the Blue Jays and finished with three hits and three RBIs.

Ryu (2-1) struck out three and walked none. The left-hander permitted only one runner past second base and yielded just one extra-base hit to a team that came in ranked second in the majors with a .467 slugging percentage.

Rather than vie for strikeouts, Ryu said he was focused more on getting the Orioles to hit the ball weakly.

""I was able to keep them off balance,"" he said through an interpreter.

Signed in December to an $80 million, four-year contract, Ryu got off to a shaky start with Toronto in July before showing the form he displayed as a star with the Dodgers. He's given up a total of two runs in his last three starts after allowing eight runs over nine innings in his first two outings.

""That was vintage Ryu,"" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. ""Ryu was outstanding. That's the reason we won the game.""

The two home runs were a factor, but mostly Ryu was the difference-maker.

""They didn’t give Ryu that big contract for nothing,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""You just never know what he’s going to throw. You don’t know what side of the plate he’s going to throw to. He’s really tough on right-handers because he can locate it in. You saw a lot of us get jammed.""

The Blue Jays took control with a four-run third against Alex Cobb (1-2). Three infield hits produced a run before Grichuk delivered a three-run drive over the centre-field wall. It was his third home run of the season, all in the last four games.

""Obviously, the pitch to Grichuk was middle middle and it was a poorly executed pitch,"" Cobb said. ""But most of the pitches that I had, I felt like I executed. I got the results.""

Cobb gave up five runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He’s winless in his last four starts.

After hitting 31 homers last year, Grichuk was batting fifth, sixth or seventh in the order this season before Montoyo decided to move him into the No. 2 spot Sunday to replace injured Bo Bichette. Over the past two games, Grichuk has two homers, four hits and six RBIs.

Pedro Severino and Renato Núñez had RBIs for the Orioles, who have dropped two straight after winning seven of eight.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Bichette (right knee sprain) had an MRI and will receive a second opinion on his injury, Montoyo said. Bichette leads Toronto with a .361 batting average.

Orioles: RH Dillon Tate (elbow contusion) came off the injured list and RH Evan Phillips was optioned to the team's alternate site.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: RH Nate Pearson (0-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his fourth start in his first big league season Tuesday night. Drafted 28th overall in 2017, the 23-year-old is looking to rebound after giving up four runs to Miami last week in 2 1/3 innings. ""I'm developing at the highest level,"" Pearson said Monday. ""When I don't have my best stuff, I'm going to struggle.""

Orioles: LH Wade LeBlanc (1-0, 7.13) has allowed a combined 10 runs over 12 innings in his last three starts.

DeBrusk scored twice while the Bruins scored four straight goals to rally and beat the Hurricanes 4-3 on Monday to take a 3-1 lead in their first-round playoff series.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

""We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,"" Marchand said. ""That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.""

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

""We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do — little battles,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.""

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President's Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk's first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy's hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina's captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy putaway from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston's first six post-season games.

""There's other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.""

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen's late goal.

""That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,"" Williams said. ""We got it handed to us.""

NOTES: David Pastrnak had a goal and an assist in Boston’s double-overtime win in Game 1, but hasn’t played since. He had 48 regular-season goals to tie Washington’s Alex Ovechkin for the league lead. … Carolina played without 20-year-old Andrei Svechnikov, who was injured when his leg twisted awkwardly beneath him late in the third period of Saturday's loss. ... DeBrusk scored his 12th and 13th playoff goals since his 2018 post-season debut. … The Hurricanes were also without D Joel Edmundson for the third straight game. … Jake Gardiner assisted on Williams’ first-period goal for his first post-season point with Carolina.

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister.
""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.
""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.
MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.","OTTAWA — Chrystia Freeland shattered a glass ceiling Tuesday, becoming the first woman to be sworn in as Canada's finance minister.

The gravitas of the moment was not lost on the former journalist and mother of three. After she spoke the English words of her oath of office, she paused to take a deep breath, before repeating the oath in French.

article continues below

""It's about time,"" Freeland said later at a press conference on Parliament Hill.

She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.

Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.

But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.

""There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,"" said Turnbull. ""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.""

Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.

She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.

""We don't like their representative very much,"" he said of her in September 2018.

Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said ""Mama (does not equal) chopped liver."" On the back it said ""Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.""

When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.

And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.

""She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,"" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.

He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.

""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.

""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.

""I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,"" he said. ""And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.""

She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.

""What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,"" Kelly said on Twitter. ""This has been missing in the department for several years.""

MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.

While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.

Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.

Trudeau said Tuesday that she had been ""a key player in my government from day one.""

The five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations are upset that Ottawa decided to give a surplus allocation of salmon — which arose this year due to reduced recreational fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic — to commercial fishers rather than to the First Nations.

Clifford Atleo, lead negotiator for one of the nations who is also called Wickaninnish, says he feels sports and commercial troll fishers are given more rights to fish in the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

He says the latest decision to shut First Nations fishers out of an opportunity to catch more chinook salmon this year shows systemic racism is ""alive and well"" within the federal fisheries department.

""We feel very strongly we're not being dealt with fairly, we know we're not being dealt with fairly,"" Atleo said.

""It's just another layer of disappointment on the part of how the government deals with us. The government doesn't realize that their attitude toward our people is dyed-in-the-wool ... And I think the government — sometimes they don't realize they're being racist. They've got age-old policies that have never changed.""

A 2018 B.C. Supreme Court ruling directed Ottawa to take a more ""generous approach"" to allocations of chinook salmon to the First Nations given the importance of this species to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people.

The ruling from B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Humphries noted that the government's salmon allocation policy at the time gave recreational fisherman priority to fish for chinook and soho salmon ahead of the First Nations and advised the fisheries minister to reassess this policy.

Despite this ruling and changes that have since placed the First Nations at a higher priority than sport fishers, the Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ehattesaht and Mowachaht/Muchalaht nations say their yearly fishing allocations have not increased.

This year, the five First Nations were told they could fish 7,724 chinook, which amounts to just 1.5 fish per person for the 5,000 members of their communities.

COVID-19 brought a new dynamic to the salmon allocations this year, as fewer sport fishers were able to come due to pandemic restrictions. This means the recreational fleet is expected to catch 15,000 less salmon than was forecasted for this year, according to figures provided by the department.

None of this surplus is going to the First Nations.

""As per approved management plans, the Area G (commercial) harvest is adjusted based on the projected recreational harvests which results in an increase of 15,000 for 2020,"" said department spokesperson Athina Vazeos.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan was unavailable for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Jennifer Kuss, noted the improvements made in giving the five nations a higher priority in the yearly salmon catch allocations, as directed by the courts.

""This change ensures that food, social, and ceremonial (fishing) continues to be prioritized first, and additionally prioritizes the Five Nations rights-based sale fishery over the recreational and commercial fishery,"" Kuss said in a statement.

The Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations argue Ottawa could have provided some of the unused catch from this year to their people to help them support their remote communities. But Atleo said fisheries officials would not even engage in discussions about it.

""The government is trying to say they consult with us, they negotiate with us. They create their fishing plans, put it on the table and it's like take or leave it,"" Atleo said.

""All we want to do is be part of the economy, part of looking after ourselves without depending on government. We don't think that's a lot to ask.""

NDP MP Gord Johns, whose riding takes in the West Coast fishing shores, said he finds it ""disgusting"" the Trudeau government has repeatedly highlighted its desire to restore the Crown's relationship with Indigenous Peoples but has still fought many legal battles with these nations over their fishing rights.

""Indigenous people in our communities rely on this fishery for their economy, for their food security, for their culture. It's part of their way of life. These are salt water people and they rely on the salmon and to be denied their right is shameful, it's disgusting that the government is taking this approach.""

The First Nations are calling on Ottawa to revisit its decision on the surplus salmon for this year to allow them a portion of the additional catch.

""The government has an opportunity to fix this with these (surplus salmon) to come with a fair opportunity to exercise their commitment, in the judge's words, for a generous allocation to the nations and to start moving forward with reconciliation,"" Johns said.

The minister's spokeswoman says Jordan takes any allegations of systemic racism ""very seriously"" and that Ottawa is working with the five nations on a reconciliation agreement on fisheries resources, which is intended to broaden their access in the area, Kuss said.

""The road to reconciliation is a long journey, and Canada is committed to moving forward together. The department has spoken with the five nations on the reallocation of (salmon catch) on multiple occasions and that open dialogue will continue.""

The BC Wildfire Service said crews are responding to the fire on Christie Mountain about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, on the east side of Skaha Lake.

The fire is estimated at 250 hectares and firefighters on the ground are being supported by air tankers.

The service said the situation was ""rapidly evolving"" and asked everyone to stay clear of the area to avoid interfering with the operation.

The order asks residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with pets and critical items.

""We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,"" the service said in a tweet.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a ""fire of note"" on Tuesday.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was smouldering with no open flame but was considered out of control. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight.

Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Firefighters have tackled dozens of wildfires after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions.

Two fires were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

""It was nice to get on the board tonight,"" said O'Reilly.

""I haven't been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it's just one game. I've got to be consistent with it.""

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

""When we take care of the puck it's effective and it's hard on them,"" said O'Reilly.

""I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We've got to stick to our structure.""

Pietrangelo said they've been working on fixing the penalty kill.

""We've been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,"" he said.

""Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.""

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

""They're blocking a lot of shots, they're studying us. They kind of know what we're doing,"" said Miller.

He said they'll make adjustments but aren't going to go back to square one.

""We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,"" he said.

""It's not like we're getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They're a good team. We're a good team. It's going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.""

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O'Reilly, last year's Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play — the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O'Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O'Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler's stick and in.

O'Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

All Western Conference games are being played in front of no fans at Rogers Place. The players are being kept isolated in a so-called bubble between games to prevent contracting COVID-19.

They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club.","TORONTO — Richard Clune remembers the drive — the pain, the anxiety, the uncertainty, the fear.

It was the spring of 2010 and Clune, who had made his NHL debut earlier that season, was finally on the road to getting the help the 23-year-old knew he needed in his crippling addiction battle.

With his younger brother, Matt, at the wheel, they drove through upstate New York in a torrential downpour home to Toronto. Clune wasn't sure he was going to make it.

""I was in the acute withdrawal phase,"" he said in a recent interview with The Canadian Press. ""I couldn't sit still for a second. The most logical thing at that point in time for me was to go jump off a bridge ... literally.

""I couldn't really see myself coming out of it.""

But come out of it he did, and a decade later, Clune is sharing his story in ""Hi, My Name is Dicky,"" a raw documentary available on iTunes and AppleTV that details his life from aspiring youth hockey player to out-of-control junior antagonist to pro athlete teetering on the edge — one consumed by drugs, alcohol and mental illness.

His journey to recovery started in earnest on that lonely stretch of highway.

""My brother really had to talk me off the ledge,"" Clune said. ""When I see his face and when I see my other brother Ben's face, that's what gave me strength to live, because I didn't really want to live for myself at that time.

""Matt, at a couple points on that drive, had to do things that no younger brother should have to do and really dig down deep and get me home.""

The documentary from Taylor Prestidge and Haris Usanovic of Upper Canada Films tracks Clune's life and career, recovery and redemption. It includes interviews with Clune's parents, brothers, teammates and coaches.

Clune was driven to be the best as a child, but the pressure led him down a dark path at early age.

""I made that decision I was going to put my head down and not see anything but being a hockey player,"" Clune, who was selected in the third round of the 2005 NHL draft by the Dallas Stars, says in the film.

He began to try alcohol in his early teens as a way to cope, and it escalated quickly once he got to high school and then the Ontario Hockey League.

""I had this hole inside me that made me insecure and afraid of the world,"" Clune recounts. ""I got wasted and was like, 'Wow. OK. I'll be able to do this. I can cope with this. It's like a warm blanket.'

""Alcohol saved me. It was my solution to that problem of being self-absorbed and focused on all the things that made me insecure and self-conscious and in pain and sad.""

But he didn't realize how much of a spiral his life was taking. In junior, he would drive from bar to bar, party to party, drinking, smoking marjiuana and doing cocaine.

""I wanted to walk that line of looking death in the face every day, but still play hockey and do all these things,"" Clune says in the film. ""I don't know how I did it.""

Things got worse after junior when he was living in the United States by himself before making his NHL debut in that fateful 2009-10 season, months before becoming completely unglued.

""I had achieved my goal,"" he recalls on screen. ""But I hated myself.""

Clune eventually checked into rehab a second time — he went once before, but didn't stay — and committed to getting better with a lot of help from the people around him.

After he got out, he resumed his career and went onto play a total of 120 regular-season games in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Nashville Predators. His contract was bought out in 2015, and he was again at a crossroads — retire or keep going.

That's when the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were in the early stages of their massive rebuild, came calling to see if Clune wanted to be part of their program. They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club. At the very least, he would play in the minors and help foster a new culture.

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, who was in charge of the minor-league Marlies at the time, saw something in Clune that could be useful.

""He provides a certain energy,"" Dubas said. ""He provides experience in his life that I thought brought a great spirit to our team.""

Clune played 19 games with Leafs, but the forward truly made his mark with the Marlies. He helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018 and plans to continue his on-ice career, but equally important was how he's helped mentor a number of current NHLers.

He's proud of where he is, and not shy talking about how he got there. Clune still goes to meetings, does the 12 steps and now works to help others.

He also thinks a lot about why he made the decision to live, to fight, and get better, when many others — including some fellow pro hockey players — have gone down a different path.

""In the beginning, it was because I wanted to see my brothers,"" said Clune, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Then it transformed into wanting to live for myself. I started to discover what it feels like to have self esteem and to have love.

""I just hope people realize that they're not alone with how they feel. Don't be afraid to ask for help.""

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday.
""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League.

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

article continues below

""After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,"" Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal's three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first overall by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

""A low-maintenance superstar,"" said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg's senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At five foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn't blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack of getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday. ""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League. I think it was Dale's arrival that really cemented the future of the franchise and I think we all have recollections of that first year, that Calder (Trophy) year and then everything that would follow.

""He was truly a superstar as a hockey player, but I think why he was so loved here was not just that but largely the fact that he made this his home and became one of us. I think everybody shared that sense of pride in Dale's career as a player.""

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: ""All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL's all time greatest players.""

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

""What an incredible human being,"" Selanne tweeted.

Montreal Canadiens associate coach Kirk Muller also had a chance to speak with Hawerchuk in recent days.

""I talked to Dale a few days ago, and we had a good chance to chat. A good friend, had a real good opportunity to play against one of the all-time best players. As a hockey player, we all know how great he was, but he was a good friend and just a really special person, did a lot for charities. It's a real loss for us in the hockey world.""

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk ""one of the most decorated players in our game's history.""

In September 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

""For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I'm ready to fight it,"" he told TSN in October 2019. ""I want to live to tell the story.""

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie's bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames players Andrew Mangiapane and Rasmus Andersson remembered playing for Hawerchuk in Barrie.

""I don't know where I'd be without him,"" said Mangiapane. ""Very sad news today. I owe my career basically to him and the whole Barrie organization.""

Andersson, from Sweden, said ""Dale was a fantastic human being. Such a great person. My first week in Barrie he invited us over to his house and really just welcomed me to Canada. I cannot say enough good things about him as a person. Obviously a real good coach, too.""

""It's awful news.""

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday's opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at age two and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur's record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

""I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive — well maybe a little further now with the traffic,"" he said. ""I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""

""I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,"" he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and '81 with teammates that included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL's top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt like he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year — the youngest recipient at the time — and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

""Just one of the greatest. You could tell from day one. We knew from when he was 18 years old as a player that he would turn the (Jets) franchise around. Certainly one of the best I’ve ever played with and coached,"" said Dallas Stars coach Rick Bowness, who played with and coached Hawerchuk in the '80s.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

""He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,"" said Mike Doran, Winnipeg's director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the faceoff in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux's famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

""It turned out fantastic,"" said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada's call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets ""are etched in my mind every day that I live.""

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes' ring of honour.

Hawerchuk re-wrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia whom he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

""It's like going back down memory lane,"" he said in his induction speech.

""All the experiences have been fantastic,"" he added. ""I mean, sometimes they didn't feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing ... Even though I didn't win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn't change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.""

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets' Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November 2017.

""Tonight we fly Ducky's number high,"" said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue's ""Home Sweet Home,"" before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

""Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,"" said the PA announcer.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

""I've been to every part of (Manitoba), either golfing or playing (softball),"" Hawerchuk said. ""I've gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I'm honoured and I'm very humbled.""

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.

And that includes how to allow players under contract to CFL teams the ability to sign elsewhere — most notably the NFL — if the opportunity arises. On Monday, the CFL cancelled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The focus right now for us on a few certain things and one of them is ensuring if there's an ability for our players to receive some form of payment this year,"" Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA's executive director, said Monday during a conference call. ""They should be able to do that if they have an opportunity.""

While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season. However, 66 players have currently opted out of participating in the 2020 campaign, which could create opportunity for some CFL players to sign deals south of the border and have a chance to earn a football paycheque, either on the active roster or on the practice squad.

While there's no shortage of collegiate players available, the advantage a CFL player has is pro experience, a fact not lost upon NFL personnel people.

The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign. This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.

And players on NFL practice rosters receive at least US$8,000 per week.

Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the CFL is amendable to doing what it can to help its players.

""Where we can do something we will,"" he said. ""We're going to be committed to working towards good outcomes, the best possible outcomes we can have with out players.

""That's not going to mean we're going to be able to do everything but we're certainly going to go into this with a real positive spirit.""

Something else that will be on the CFL-CFLPA radar will be the current collective bargaining agreement, which is slated to expire after the 2021 season. But union president Solomon Elimimian said the two sides covered a lot of ground this time around during talks to amend the agreement for a shortened '20 season.

""Whether we deal with '21 when it comes or after the '21 season I think there's hope there that we can work together,"" Elimimian said. ""Obviously the relationship between the players and the league needs to be one where the players feel appreciated.

""Everyone wants to the league to reach its full potential. The partnership has to be one that's very genuine and the players have to feel part of that. If that happens, the sky is the limit.""

Cavan Biggio also went deep for the Blue Jays and finished with three hits and three RBIs.

Ryu (2-1) struck out three and walked none. The left-hander permitted only one runner past second base and yielded just one extra-base hit to a team that came in ranked second in the majors with a .467 slugging percentage.

Rather than vie for strikeouts, Ryu said he was focused more on getting the Orioles to hit the ball weakly.

""I was able to keep them off balance,"" he said through an interpreter.

Signed in December to an $80 million, four-year contract, Ryu got off to a shaky start with Toronto in July before showing the form he displayed as a star with the Dodgers. He's given up a total of two runs in his last three starts after allowing eight runs over nine innings in his first two outings.

""That was vintage Ryu,"" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. ""Ryu was outstanding. That's the reason we won the game.""

The two home runs were a factor, but mostly Ryu was the difference-maker.

""They didn’t give Ryu that big contract for nothing,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""You just never know what he’s going to throw. You don’t know what side of the plate he’s going to throw to. He’s really tough on right-handers because he can locate it in. You saw a lot of us get jammed.""

The Blue Jays took control with a four-run third against Alex Cobb (1-2). Three infield hits produced a run before Grichuk delivered a three-run drive over the centre-field wall. It was his third home run of the season, all in the last four games.

""Obviously, the pitch to Grichuk was middle middle and it was a poorly executed pitch,"" Cobb said. ""But most of the pitches that I had, I felt like I executed. I got the results.""

Cobb gave up five runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He’s winless in his last four starts.

After hitting 31 homers last year, Grichuk was batting fifth, sixth or seventh in the order this season before Montoyo decided to move him into the No. 2 spot Sunday to replace injured Bo Bichette. Over the past two games, Grichuk has two homers, four hits and six RBIs.

Pedro Severino and Renato Núñez had RBIs for the Orioles, who have dropped two straight after winning seven of eight.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Bichette (right knee sprain) had an MRI and will receive a second opinion on his injury, Montoyo said. Bichette leads Toronto with a .361 batting average.

Orioles: RH Dillon Tate (elbow contusion) came off the injured list and RH Evan Phillips was optioned to the team's alternate site.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: RH Nate Pearson (0-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his fourth start in his first big league season Tuesday night. Drafted 28th overall in 2017, the 23-year-old is looking to rebound after giving up four runs to Miami last week in 2 1/3 innings. ""I'm developing at the highest level,"" Pearson said Monday. ""When I don't have my best stuff, I'm going to struggle.""

Orioles: LH Wade LeBlanc (1-0, 7.13) has allowed a combined 10 runs over 12 innings in his last three starts.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

""We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,"" Marchand said. ""That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.""

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

""We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do — little battles,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.""

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President's Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk's first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy's hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina's captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy putaway from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston's first six post-season games.

""There's other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.""

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen's late goal.

""That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,"" Williams said. ""We got it handed to us.""

NOTES: David Pastrnak had a goal and an assist in Boston’s double-overtime win in Game 1, but hasn’t played since. He had 48 regular-season goals to tie Washington’s Alex Ovechkin for the league lead. … Carolina played without 20-year-old Andrei Svechnikov, who was injured when his leg twisted awkwardly beneath him late in the third period of Saturday's loss. ... DeBrusk scored his 12th and 13th playoff goals since his 2018 post-season debut. … The Hurricanes were also without D Joel Edmundson for the third straight game. … Jake Gardiner assisted on Williams’ first-period goal for his first post-season point with Carolina.

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

article continues below

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister.
""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.
""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.
MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.","OTTAWA — Chrystia Freeland shattered a glass ceiling Tuesday, becoming the first woman to be sworn in as Canada's finance minister.

The gravitas of the moment was not lost on the former journalist and mother of three. After she spoke the English words of her oath of office, she paused to take a deep breath, before repeating the oath in French.

article continues below

""It's about time,"" Freeland said later at a press conference on Parliament Hill.

She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.

Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.

But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.

""There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,"" said Turnbull. ""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.""

Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.

She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.

""We don't like their representative very much,"" he said of her in September 2018.

Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said ""Mama (does not equal) chopped liver."" On the back it said ""Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.""

When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.

And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.

""She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,"" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.

He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.

""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.

""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.

""I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,"" he said. ""And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.""

She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.

""What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,"" Kelly said on Twitter. ""This has been missing in the department for several years.""

MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.

While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.

Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.

Trudeau said Tuesday that she had been ""a key player in my government from day one.""

The five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations are upset that Ottawa decided to give a surplus allocation of salmon — which arose this year due to reduced recreational fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic — to commercial fishers rather than to the First Nations.

Clifford Atleo, lead negotiator for one of the nations who is also called Wickaninnish, says he feels sports and commercial troll fishers are given more rights to fish in the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

He says the latest decision to shut First Nations fishers out of an opportunity to catch more chinook salmon this year shows systemic racism is ""alive and well"" within the federal fisheries department.

""We feel very strongly we're not being dealt with fairly, we know we're not being dealt with fairly,"" Atleo said.

""It's just another layer of disappointment on the part of how the government deals with us. The government doesn't realize that their attitude toward our people is dyed-in-the-wool ... And I think the government — sometimes they don't realize they're being racist. They've got age-old policies that have never changed.""

A 2018 B.C. Supreme Court ruling directed Ottawa to take a more ""generous approach"" to allocations of chinook salmon to the First Nations given the importance of this species to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people.

The ruling from B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Humphries noted that the government's salmon allocation policy at the time gave recreational fisherman priority to fish for chinook and soho salmon ahead of the First Nations and advised the fisheries minister to reassess this policy.

Despite this ruling and changes that have since placed the First Nations at a higher priority than sport fishers, the Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ehattesaht and Mowachaht/Muchalaht nations say their yearly fishing allocations have not increased.

This year, the five First Nations were told they could fish 7,724 chinook, which amounts to just 1.5 fish per person for the 5,000 members of their communities.

COVID-19 brought a new dynamic to the salmon allocations this year, as fewer sport fishers were able to come due to pandemic restrictions. This means the recreational fleet is expected to catch 15,000 less salmon than was forecasted for this year, according to figures provided by the department.

None of this surplus is going to the First Nations.

""As per approved management plans, the Area G (commercial) harvest is adjusted based on the projected recreational harvests which results in an increase of 15,000 for 2020,"" said department spokesperson Athina Vazeos.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan was unavailable for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Jennifer Kuss, noted the improvements made in giving the five nations a higher priority in the yearly salmon catch allocations, as directed by the courts.

""This change ensures that food, social, and ceremonial (fishing) continues to be prioritized first, and additionally prioritizes the Five Nations rights-based sale fishery over the recreational and commercial fishery,"" Kuss said in a statement.

The Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations argue Ottawa could have provided some of the unused catch from this year to their people to help them support their remote communities. But Atleo said fisheries officials would not even engage in discussions about it.

""The government is trying to say they consult with us, they negotiate with us. They create their fishing plans, put it on the table and it's like take or leave it,"" Atleo said.

""All we want to do is be part of the economy, part of looking after ourselves without depending on government. We don't think that's a lot to ask.""

NDP MP Gord Johns, whose riding takes in the West Coast fishing shores, said he finds it ""disgusting"" the Trudeau government has repeatedly highlighted its desire to restore the Crown's relationship with Indigenous Peoples but has still fought many legal battles with these nations over their fishing rights.

""Indigenous people in our communities rely on this fishery for their economy, for their food security, for their culture. It's part of their way of life. These are salt water people and they rely on the salmon and to be denied their right is shameful, it's disgusting that the government is taking this approach.""

The First Nations are calling on Ottawa to revisit its decision on the surplus salmon for this year to allow them a portion of the additional catch.

""The government has an opportunity to fix this with these (surplus salmon) to come with a fair opportunity to exercise their commitment, in the judge's words, for a generous allocation to the nations and to start moving forward with reconciliation,"" Johns said.

The minister's spokeswoman says Jordan takes any allegations of systemic racism ""very seriously"" and that Ottawa is working with the five nations on a reconciliation agreement on fisheries resources, which is intended to broaden their access in the area, Kuss said.

""The road to reconciliation is a long journey, and Canada is committed to moving forward together. The department has spoken with the five nations on the reallocation of (salmon catch) on multiple occasions and that open dialogue will continue.""

The Regional District of Okanagan Similkameen's emergency operations centre issued the evacuation order covering 319 properties in the Heritage Hills area on Tuesday afternoon.

The BC Wildfire Service said crews are responding to the fire on Christie Mountain about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, on the east side of Skaha Lake.

The fire is estimated at 250 hectares and firefighters on the ground are being supported by air tankers.

The service said the situation was ""rapidly evolving"" and asked everyone to stay clear of the area to avoid interfering with the operation.

The order asks residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with pets and critical items.

""We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,"" the service said in a tweet.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a ""fire of note"" on Tuesday.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was smouldering with no open flame but was considered out of control. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight.

Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Firefighters have tackled dozens of wildfires after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions.

Two fires were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

""It was nice to get on the board tonight,"" said O'Reilly.

""I haven't been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it's just one game. I've got to be consistent with it.""

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

""When we take care of the puck it's effective and it's hard on them,"" said O'Reilly.

""I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We've got to stick to our structure.""

Pietrangelo said they've been working on fixing the penalty kill.

""We've been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,"" he said.

""Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.""

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

""They're blocking a lot of shots, they're studying us. They kind of know what we're doing,"" said Miller.

He said they'll make adjustments but aren't going to go back to square one.

""We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,"" he said.

""It's not like we're getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They're a good team. We're a good team. It's going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.""

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O'Reilly, last year's Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play — the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O'Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O'Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler's stick and in.

O'Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

All Western Conference games are being played in front of no fans at Rogers Place. The players are being kept isolated in a so-called bubble between games to prevent contracting COVID-19.

They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club.","TORONTO — Richard Clune remembers the drive — the pain, the anxiety, the uncertainty, the fear.

It was the spring of 2010 and Clune, who had made his NHL debut earlier that season, was finally on the road to getting the help the 23-year-old knew he needed in his crippling addiction battle.

article continues below

With his younger brother, Matt, at the wheel, they drove through upstate New York in a torrential downpour home to Toronto. Clune wasn't sure he was going to make it.

""I was in the acute withdrawal phase,"" he said in a recent interview with The Canadian Press. ""I couldn't sit still for a second. The most logical thing at that point in time for me was to go jump off a bridge ... literally.

""I couldn't really see myself coming out of it.""

But come out of it he did, and a decade later, Clune is sharing his story in ""Hi, My Name is Dicky,"" a raw documentary available on iTunes and AppleTV that details his life from aspiring youth hockey player to out-of-control junior antagonist to pro athlete teetering on the edge — one consumed by drugs, alcohol and mental illness.

His journey to recovery started in earnest on that lonely stretch of highway.

""My brother really had to talk me off the ledge,"" Clune said. ""When I see his face and when I see my other brother Ben's face, that's what gave me strength to live, because I didn't really want to live for myself at that time.

""Matt, at a couple points on that drive, had to do things that no younger brother should have to do and really dig down deep and get me home.""

The documentary from Taylor Prestidge and Haris Usanovic of Upper Canada Films tracks Clune's life and career, recovery and redemption. It includes interviews with Clune's parents, brothers, teammates and coaches.

Clune was driven to be the best as a child, but the pressure led him down a dark path at early age.

""I made that decision I was going to put my head down and not see anything but being a hockey player,"" Clune, who was selected in the third round of the 2005 NHL draft by the Dallas Stars, says in the film.

He began to try alcohol in his early teens as a way to cope, and it escalated quickly once he got to high school and then the Ontario Hockey League.

""I had this hole inside me that made me insecure and afraid of the world,"" Clune recounts. ""I got wasted and was like, 'Wow. OK. I'll be able to do this. I can cope with this. It's like a warm blanket.'

""Alcohol saved me. It was my solution to that problem of being self-absorbed and focused on all the things that made me insecure and self-conscious and in pain and sad.""

But he didn't realize how much of a spiral his life was taking. In junior, he would drive from bar to bar, party to party, drinking, smoking marjiuana and doing cocaine.

""I wanted to walk that line of looking death in the face every day, but still play hockey and do all these things,"" Clune says in the film. ""I don't know how I did it.""

Things got worse after junior when he was living in the United States by himself before making his NHL debut in that fateful 2009-10 season, months before becoming completely unglued.

""I had achieved my goal,"" he recalls on screen. ""But I hated myself.""

Clune eventually checked into rehab a second time — he went once before, but didn't stay — and committed to getting better with a lot of help from the people around him.

After he got out, he resumed his career and went onto play a total of 120 regular-season games in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Nashville Predators. His contract was bought out in 2015, and he was again at a crossroads — retire or keep going.

That's when the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were in the early stages of their massive rebuild, came calling to see if Clune wanted to be part of their program. They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club. At the very least, he would play in the minors and help foster a new culture.

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, who was in charge of the minor-league Marlies at the time, saw something in Clune that could be useful.

""He provides a certain energy,"" Dubas said. ""He provides experience in his life that I thought brought a great spirit to our team.""

Clune played 19 games with Leafs, but the forward truly made his mark with the Marlies. He helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018 and plans to continue his on-ice career, but equally important was how he's helped mentor a number of current NHLers.

He's proud of where he is, and not shy talking about how he got there. Clune still goes to meetings, does the 12 steps and now works to help others.

He also thinks a lot about why he made the decision to live, to fight, and get better, when many others — including some fellow pro hockey players — have gone down a different path.

""In the beginning, it was because I wanted to see my brothers,"" said Clune, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Then it transformed into wanting to live for myself. I started to discover what it feels like to have self esteem and to have love.

""I just hope people realize that they're not alone with how they feel. Don't be afraid to ask for help.""

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

article continues below

""After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,"" Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal's three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first overall by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

""A low-maintenance superstar,"" said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg's senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At five foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn't blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack of getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday. ""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League. I think it was Dale's arrival that really cemented the future of the franchise and I think we all have recollections of that first year, that Calder (Trophy) year and then everything that would follow.

""He was truly a superstar as a hockey player, but I think why he was so loved here was not just that but largely the fact that he made this his home and became one of us. I think everybody shared that sense of pride in Dale's career as a player.""

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: ""All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL's all time greatest players.""

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

""What an incredible human being,"" Selanne tweeted.

Montreal Canadiens associate coach Kirk Muller also had a chance to speak with Hawerchuk in recent days.

""I talked to Dale a few days ago, and we had a good chance to chat. A good friend, had a real good opportunity to play against one of the all-time best players. As a hockey player, we all know how great he was, but he was a good friend and just a really special person, did a lot for charities. It's a real loss for us in the hockey world.""

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk ""one of the most decorated players in our game's history.""

In September 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

""For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I'm ready to fight it,"" he told TSN in October 2019. ""I want to live to tell the story.""

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie's bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames players Andrew Mangiapane and Rasmus Andersson remembered playing for Hawerchuk in Barrie.

""I don't know where I'd be without him,"" said Mangiapane. ""Very sad news today. I owe my career basically to him and the whole Barrie organization.""

Andersson, from Sweden, said ""Dale was a fantastic human being. Such a great person. My first week in Barrie he invited us over to his house and really just welcomed me to Canada. I cannot say enough good things about him as a person. Obviously a real good coach, too.""

""It's awful news.""

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday's opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at age two and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur's record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

""I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive — well maybe a little further now with the traffic,"" he said. ""I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""

""I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,"" he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and '81 with teammates that included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL's top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt like he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year — the youngest recipient at the time — and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

""Just one of the greatest. You could tell from day one. We knew from when he was 18 years old as a player that he would turn the (Jets) franchise around. Certainly one of the best I’ve ever played with and coached,"" said Dallas Stars coach Rick Bowness, who played with and coached Hawerchuk in the '80s.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

""He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,"" said Mike Doran, Winnipeg's director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the faceoff in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux's famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

""It turned out fantastic,"" said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada's call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets ""are etched in my mind every day that I live.""

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes' ring of honour.

Hawerchuk re-wrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia whom he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

""It's like going back down memory lane,"" he said in his induction speech.

""All the experiences have been fantastic,"" he added. ""I mean, sometimes they didn't feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing ... Even though I didn't win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn't change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.""

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets' Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November 2017.

""Tonight we fly Ducky's number high,"" said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue's ""Home Sweet Home,"" before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

""Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,"" said the PA announcer.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

""I've been to every part of (Manitoba), either golfing or playing (softball),"" Hawerchuk said. ""I've gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I'm honoured and I'm very humbled.""

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.

And that includes how to allow players under contract to CFL teams the ability to sign elsewhere — most notably the NFL — if the opportunity arises. On Monday, the CFL cancelled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The focus right now for us on a few certain things and one of them is ensuring if there's an ability for our players to receive some form of payment this year,"" Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA's executive director, said Monday during a conference call. ""They should be able to do that if they have an opportunity.""

While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season. However, 66 players have currently opted out of participating in the 2020 campaign, which could create opportunity for some CFL players to sign deals south of the border and have a chance to earn a football paycheque, either on the active roster or on the practice squad.

While there's no shortage of collegiate players available, the advantage a CFL player has is pro experience, a fact not lost upon NFL personnel people.

The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign. This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.

And players on NFL practice rosters receive at least US$8,000 per week.

Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the CFL is amendable to doing what it can to help its players.

""Where we can do something we will,"" he said. ""We're going to be committed to working towards good outcomes, the best possible outcomes we can have with out players.

""That's not going to mean we're going to be able to do everything but we're certainly going to go into this with a real positive spirit.""

Something else that will be on the CFL-CFLPA radar will be the current collective bargaining agreement, which is slated to expire after the 2021 season. But union president Solomon Elimimian said the two sides covered a lot of ground this time around during talks to amend the agreement for a shortened '20 season.

""Whether we deal with '21 when it comes or after the '21 season I think there's hope there that we can work together,"" Elimimian said. ""Obviously the relationship between the players and the league needs to be one where the players feel appreciated.

""Everyone wants to the league to reach its full potential. The partnership has to be one that's very genuine and the players have to feel part of that. If that happens, the sky is the limit.""

""I was able to keep them off balance,"" he said through an interpreter.

Signed in December to an $80 million, four-year contract, Ryu got off to a shaky start with Toronto in July before showing the form he displayed as a star with the Dodgers. He's given up a total of two runs in his last three starts after allowing eight runs over nine innings in his first two outings.

""That was vintage Ryu,"" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. ""Ryu was outstanding. That's the reason we won the game.""

The two home runs were a factor, but mostly Ryu was the difference-maker.

""They didn’t give Ryu that big contract for nothing,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""You just never know what he’s going to throw. You don’t know what side of the plate he’s going to throw to. He’s really tough on right-handers because he can locate it in. You saw a lot of us get jammed.""

The Blue Jays took control with a four-run third against Alex Cobb (1-2). Three infield hits produced a run before Grichuk delivered a three-run drive over the centre-field wall. It was his third home run of the season, all in the last four games.

""Obviously, the pitch to Grichuk was middle middle and it was a poorly executed pitch,"" Cobb said. ""But most of the pitches that I had, I felt like I executed. I got the results.""

Cobb gave up five runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He’s winless in his last four starts.

After hitting 31 homers last year, Grichuk was batting fifth, sixth or seventh in the order this season before Montoyo decided to move him into the No. 2 spot Sunday to replace injured Bo Bichette. Over the past two games, Grichuk has two homers, four hits and six RBIs.

Pedro Severino and Renato Núñez had RBIs for the Orioles, who have dropped two straight after winning seven of eight.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Bichette (right knee sprain) had an MRI and will receive a second opinion on his injury, Montoyo said. Bichette leads Toronto with a .361 batting average.

Orioles: RH Dillon Tate (elbow contusion) came off the injured list and RH Evan Phillips was optioned to the team's alternate site.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: RH Nate Pearson (0-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his fourth start in his first big league season Tuesday night. Drafted 28th overall in 2017, the 23-year-old is looking to rebound after giving up four runs to Miami last week in 2 1/3 innings. ""I'm developing at the highest level,"" Pearson said Monday. ""When I don't have my best stuff, I'm going to struggle.""

Orioles: LH Wade LeBlanc (1-0, 7.13) has allowed a combined 10 runs over 12 innings in his last three starts.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

""We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,"" Marchand said. ""That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.""

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

""We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do — little battles,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.""

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President's Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk's first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy's hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina's captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy putaway from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston's first six post-season games.

""There's other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.""

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen's late goal.

""That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,"" Williams said. ""We got it handed to us.""

NOTES: David Pastrnak had a goal and an assist in Boston’s double-overtime win in Game 1, but hasn’t played since. He had 48 regular-season goals to tie Washington’s Alex Ovechkin for the league lead. … Carolina played without 20-year-old Andrei Svechnikov, who was injured when his leg twisted awkwardly beneath him late in the third period of Saturday's loss. ... DeBrusk scored his 12th and 13th playoff goals since his 2018 post-season debut. … The Hurricanes were also without D Joel Edmundson for the third straight game. … Jake Gardiner assisted on Williams’ first-period goal for his first post-season point with Carolina.

Neither Cassirer's heirs nor Spain's Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum dispute the painting's early history.
Both U.S. District Judge John Walter, in a 2019 ruling, and the appeals court in Tuesday's, criticized the baron and the Spanish foundation for not doing more to discover whether the painting was looted art.
Both courts also criticized Spain for not living up to what the courts called ""moral commitments"" to return Nazi-looted art.
But that is the state of the law,"" the appeals court said in its ruling.","LOS ANGELES — A U.S. appeals court has ruled that a Camille Pissarro painting a Jewish woman traded to the Nazis to escape the Holocaust in 1939 may remain the property of a Spanish museum that acquired it more than a half-century later.

The unanimous ruling issued Monday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest — but possibly not the last — in a case that has wound through the courts of Spain and the United States for 20 years.

article continues below

At stake is ""La Rue St. Honoré, effet de Soleil, Après-Midi, 1898,"" an oil-on-canvas work of a rain-swept Paris street that Pissarro painted as he gazed at the scene from his hotel window. Its value has been estimated at $30 million.

Lilly Cassirer’s father-in-law bought it directly from Pissarro’s art dealer and left it to her and her husband when he died. In 1939, she traded it to the Nazis in exchange for exit visas for herself, her husband and her grandson, who eventually settled in the U.S. Her great-grandson, David Cassirer of San Diego, has continued the litigation since his father's death.

Neither Cassirer's heirs nor Spain's Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum dispute the painting's early history.

What's at issue all these years later is whether Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza made any serious effort to determine the painting was looted art when he acquired it from a New York gallery owner for $275,000 in 1976.

Also whether Spanish curators did their due diligence in tracing its provenance when a Spanish non-profit foundation acquired it and hundreds of other paintings from the baron's collection in 1992 and created the Madrid museum that bears his name.

Lilly Cassirer’s heirs say she spent years trying to recover the painting before concluding it was lost and accepting $13,000 in reparations from the German government in 1958.

It wasn’t until 1999 that her grandson, Claude, who had vividly recalled seeing it hanging in the family's German home, discovered it in the Madrid museum. After Spain refused to hand it over, he sued.

Attorney Thaddeus Stauber, who has represented the museum since the case reached U.S. courts in 2005, hailed Monday's decision, noting that the painting was sold and resold to numerous legitimate and prominent collectors over the years before the baron obtained it, with none discovering it had been seized by the Nazis.

He said there also appeared to be no effort by Thyssen-Bornemisza or any other collector to hide it from the public.

""We've been transparent from the start of this case, and we're very pleased that there's been a trial now and it brings it to a conclusion, we trust,"" he said Tuesday.

He did say the Cassirer family may appeal to the full 9th Circuit or even the U.S. Supreme Court.

The family did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday, but the president of the Holocaust Survivors Foundation USA denounced the decision.

""The Nazis murdered more than 6 million Jews, including 1.5 million children under the age of 12, and including 105 members of my family,"" David Schaecter said. ""How on God’s Earth can Spain fight so hard to deny a Jewish family its precious legacy that was looted by the Nazis? And how on God’s Earth can an American court ignore the unprecedented trauma of the Holocaust and reward Spain for its greed?""

Both U.S. District Judge John Walter, in a 2019 ruling, and the appeals court in Tuesday's, criticized the baron and the Spanish foundation for not doing more to discover whether the painting was looted art. But both courts concluded there was no proof either deliberately hid that it was.

Both courts also criticized Spain for not living up to what the courts called ""moral commitments"" to return Nazi-looted art.

""It is perhaps unfortunate that a country and a government can preen as moralistic in its declarations, yet not be bound by those declarations. But that is the state of the law,"" the appeals court said in its ruling."

Even so, back-to-school shopping doesn't have to be more expensive than any other year, said Seung Hwan (Mark) Lee, an associate professor of retail management at Ryerson University.
If your child is doing virtual classes, he suggests ensuring you have a reliable laptop or tablet with a webcam.

""Find out more about what your school district is doing, and then adjust according to that.","TORONTO — Vonny Sweetland has yet to decide if he will be sending his 12-year-old sister Josephine back to class in September, but just in case he does, he's been stocking up on supplies for months.

He picks up hand sanitizer when he sees it in stores, grabbed new masks last month, bought a fresh uniform and has been testing out Josephine's muscle power with some new lunch containers.

The new additions to her backpack and are all part of a wave of changes families — and their wallets — are being confronted with as they prepare for back to school, whether it's sourcing protective equipment or choosing a thermos their child can open unassisted.

""In a COVID-era, all of these things we take for granted or think are minuscule are actually really important,"" said Sweetland, who is his sister's guardian.

""These are things as simple as a teacher helping you unpack your lunch or zipping a zipper. To prevent potential spread, I don't think teachers are really going to be doing these things.""

The cost of so many new supplies can easily add up.

A Deloitte survey of 1,200 parents who have at least one child attending school in grades K-12 this fall found the average family will spend $102 on school supplies, $216 on clothing and accessories, $395 on computers and hardware, $316 on electronic gadgets and digital subscriptions.

The survey, which was conducted between May and July, found those families will allocate $61 on a new category: home or health supplies.

Even so, back-to-school shopping doesn't have to be more expensive than any other year, said Seung Hwan (Mark) Lee, an associate professor of retail management at Ryerson University.

He recommends shoppers compare prices and take advantage of sales.

Anne Marie Taber said she's noticed plenty of sales, though she hasn't sought them out when shopping with seven-year-old daughter Avery because she tries to minimize her time in stores and instead use online options with delivery to lessen her exposure to the virus.

She stocked up as soon as she could on Old Navy's uniform-style clothing because several sizes were out of stock and also grabbed Avery a new backpack.

On top of masks and hand sanitizers, they bought a wide-mouth water bottle without a straw to make cleaning easy, plastic Duo-Tangs that can be wiped down and a set of art supplies that Avery has been reminded not to share.

""This is extra stuff we haven't had to buy in the past but it's a small dollar to pay to make sure that that is just hers exclusively,"" Taber said.

Parents may also want to consider disposable cutlery, if they have children that bring lunches to school and are worried about germs spreading through anything reuseable, Lee said.

If your child is doing virtual classes, he suggests ensuring you have a reliable laptop or tablet with a webcam.

Those who want to go all out or are older and have specific needs for programs they are enrolled in, may need to think about microphones and speakers too.

Those supplies don't come cheap. However, the cost of those high-ticket items could be partially offset by a change he sees happening across universities and colleges during the pandemic.

""It's no longer really about carrying around the heavy textbooks,"" he said.

""Many professors aren't holding lengthy exams because the exams are becoming very difficult to monitor and you can't really get a proctor to look at how students are conducting their exams... so using test banks or textbooks no longer apply.""

If you're feeling anxious or stressed about back to school shopping and advertisements are making you feel you better get to a store soon, Lee says not worry.

""I would advise parents right now not to rush into getting supplies,"" he said.

""Find out more about what your school district is doing, and then adjust according to that. A deal can always be had.""

Each summer, the former U.S. president unveils a selection of his favourite songs of the season.

Most of the artists are household names, but Obama often leaves room to showcase a few lesser-known acts, much to their surprise.

""It's cool to think that Obama, or the Obamas together, have listened to my music,"" he said.

""It's a really nice feeling to think my music has gone that far.""

""Neon Skyline"" is a particularly Canadian song choice because its story unravels inside the Skyline Restaurant, a real-life diner in Toronto's Parkdale neighbourhood, where two friends agree to meet for a beer shortly before one runs into his ex.

Shauf, who was born in Regina, said he frequented the Skyline when he moved to Toronto several years back

""It became a really friendly place to hang out and the setting for my record,"" he said.

Shauf has been a critical favourite in Canada for years. He was nominated for multiple Juno Awards, and ""The Neon Skyline"" landed on the long list of Polaris Prize contenders for this year's best album.

Fellow Canadian artists Drake and PartyNextDoor also showed up on Obama's list.

Both of them shared billing on Popcaan's track ""Twist & Turn,"" while Drake was also featured for his part on Rihanna's megahit ""Work.""

PartyNextDoor, who is Mississauga, Ont.-raised rapper Jahron Brathwaite, made a second appearance for his solo effort ""PGT,"" taken from his 2020 album, ""Partymobile.""

The online survey of 1,510 Canadians over age 18, including 385 parents with school-aged children in their households, took place Aug. 14-16. An internet poll cannot be given a margin of error because it is not a random sample.

The results underscore the nervousness and sensitivities around the planned reopening of school, says Leger president Jean-Marc Leger, with many parents supporting the return of classes but ready to shut it down again at the drop of a hat.

""People are nervous,"" he said. ""It's a very sensitive question.""

For his part, Trudeau said the federal government is making infrastructure money available for provinces to help retrofit schools and other public buildings to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. But he also acknowledged the concern many parents are feeling.

""I know that lots of parents are going to be watching carefully what their local school boards' plans are,"" he said. ""There is a lot of reflection in a lot of households, including mine, as to what's going to happen when September rolls around.""

The Leger survey also found strong support among respondents with children for requiring certain protections to be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at schools, including 76 per cent who said students should have to wear masks.

The result was not broken down by whether masks should be required for only high school students or students in both high school and elementary. Some provinces such as Ontario are requiring masks for students in certain grades but not others.

Eighty-four per cent of respondents with kids said teachers and school staff should be required to wear masks while 75 per cent supported temperature checks for children and 71 per cent wanted screening questionnaires.

""People are saying: 'OK, we agree. We support the government's initiative. But at the same time, you should ensure that the rules are respected at school,'"" said Leger.

Parents were more divided over what to do if a student or teacher in their kid's class tested positive for COVID-19.

While 24 per cent reported they would keep their kids home from school indefinitely, 35 per cent said they would keep them home for at least 14 days while 33 per cent indicated they would follow the advice of their school on next steps.

Bernier said last summer was the team's most successful visit ever, excavating cabins and a steward's pantry on Erebus, and bringing 355 artifacts to the surface for restoration and study. Robot cameras were used to probe inside the HMS Terror for the first time since it was discovered four years ago.

The plan was to return again later this month, when Arctic conditions are normally best for this kind of work, and keep going.

But because of COVID-19, access to the wrecks of HMS Erebus and HMS Terror in waters off King William Island in Nunavut, is closed to all but local Inuit Guardians keeping watch on the sites, and those with harvesting rights in the surrounding waters.

""It is quite disappointing,"" said Bernier, the manager of underwater archaeology.

The two ships, with 129 men on board, left England in 1845 to pursue the dream of finding and mapping the Northwest Passage. They would never return.

The whereabouts of the ships were a global mystery until 2014, when Parks Canada divers, helped by Inuit guides, located Erebus in 2014, and then Terror two years later, about 100 kilometres further north, in the coincidentally named Terror Bay.

While missing one more year of exploration when the wrecked ships have already lain in their watery graves for more than a century and a half may seem like no big deal, every year that passes brings more risk that some of the secrets contained within may never be revealed.

""We are concerned about Erebus,"" said Bernier.

That ship, the only one divers have been inside of as yet, is close to the surface, and sometimes if the waves are high enough, the top of the ship is fully exposed. Some years, said Bernier, they return to find extensive damage already done to the ship. Others they come back and nothing has changed at all.

The break, said Bernier, could give them more time to research and begin preservation and restoration work on the objects already recovered. Like a pair of epaulets left in a box under the bed of the cabin belonging to Lt. James Walter Fairholme, and a brush with hairs still in it that can be analyzed for DNA.

But that work too has been delayed by COVID-19.

The archaeology team was sent home in mid-March when most federal buildings were closed. The date of return to their labs is still not known, said Bernier.

The team has been able to use the photos and videos taken on both ships to work on mapping them out. Terror, which is more protected than Erebus because it lies in deeper water, hasn't been mapped fully at all yet, so that work is underway this summer. Diving into the ships takes precision and the maps are needed to do it properly.

Dives to Erebus can last as long as three hours but the deeper, and much colder waters around Terror will limit exploring that ship to about 30 minutes a day, said Bernier.

Bernier said the information gleaned from every object, every trip below the water, helps fill in gaps in the story. Since Fairholme's epaulets were found in his cabin but none of his clothes, Bernier wonders whether he decided they were expendable when he packed to leave the ship forever.

There are other questions. Why were the belongings of a Terror crew member found on Erebus? Did Terror get abandoned first and the remaining men move to Erebus before it too got trapped in the ice and sank?

Bernier said on Erebus, the plates in the pantry were still neatly stacked in their racks, a coffee pot still in it place, pencils and pencil boxes remaining on their shelves.

It suggests the ship was neither abandoned quickly, nor did it sink suddenly, since a sudden influx of water would have caused more damage.

""That's what we have to do now, is try to make things fit,"" he said. ""That will help us understand what happened, what's the timelines.""

For the archaeology team, they're just biding their time now until next year when they hope the pandemic is over and they can once again return to the North for the exploration that will make their careers.

""For an archaeologist, this is a once in a lifetime,"" he said.

BRITISH COLUMBIA

British Columbia has laid out its plan for studies to resume in ""learning groups"" this fall. School districts are to post final back-to-school details online by Aug. 26.

Back to class: Schools were initially scheduled to welcome students back full time on Sept. 8, but the province announced it is pushing back the restart date by two days to Sept. 10.

Groups: Students will be sorted into learning groups to reduce the number of people they come in contact with. For elementary and middle school students, groups will be no larger than 60 people. Secondary school groups will be capped at 120.

Physical distancing: Students and staff don't need to maintain physical distancing within their learning group, but contact should be minimized. Outside the group, physical distancing is required. Students should be more spaced out in classrooms.

Masks: Staff and students at middle and secondary schools will be required to wear masks on buses and in common areas. The provincial government says masks will also be required whenever students and teachers are outside their learning group and cannot maintain an appropriate physical distance. Students who can't wear masks for medical reasons will be exempt.

New routines: The province is urging schools to stagger recess, lunch and class transition times and take students outside whenever possible.

Transportation: Middle and high school students are asked to wear masks on buses. Students should be assigned seats, and a transparent barrier may be used to separate the driver.

ALBERTA

The province is planning to fully reopen schools from kindergarten to Grade 12 this fall. Measures will be tightened if an outbreak occurs and class sizes could be reduced to 20.

Back to class: School will be back in session with extra safety measures, but the province says there are programs to support remote and alternative learning.

Groups: Schools should sort students into cohorts by class when possible to minimize contact with others.

Physical distancing: Physical distancing is recommended when possible. Rooms should be rearranged to increase space between desks.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for staff and many students in some school settings. Students in Grades 4 to 12 must wear masks in all common areas, such as hallways and on buses. Staff are required to wear masks whenever physical distancing cannot be maintained. Mask use will be optional for kids in kindergarten through Grade 3. The government says all students and staff will receive two reusable masks as part of the policy.

SASKATCHEWAN

Saskatchewan first unveiled a set of back-to-school guidelines in June, but released more details and made some changes in August.

Back to class: Students will return to class on Sept. 8 after the province pushed the date back from as early as Sept. 1

Groups: Groups of students and staff members assigned to them should stick together throughout the day and try not to mingle with other groups. Schools should aim to minimize the number of different instructors who interact with students throughout the day.

Physical distancing: Officials say maintaining physical distance is ""less practical"" for younger children, and the focus should be on limiting physical contact. Officials suggest limiting hugs and hand holding and suggest using alternative greetings such as air high fives. Schools are also to have dedicated quarantine areas where symptomatic students can go before they are picked up by parents.

Masks: The province says it's up to school boards to decide whether to make masks mandatory for students and staff. The chief medical health officer advises Grade 4 to 12 students should wear them in busy areas such as hallways and on buses.

Transportation: Parents should take their kids to school when possible, and pickup and drop-offs should happen outside. Students using school transportation should be assigned seats, and a partition may be used to separate the driver.

New routines: Start times, recess, lunch and class transitions may be staggered to allow for more space for physical distancing. Schools should rearrange their classrooms to space out students. Students and staff are asked to bring hand sanitizer. In school public health visits for routine vaccinations will include COVID-19 testing, with parental consent.

MANITOBA

The Manitoba government says students are going back to the classroom on Sept. 8 with new guidelines.

Back to class: All students from kindergarten to Grade 8 are to have in-class instruction five days a week. High school students will also be in class full time, however, there may be some days of remote learning.

Groups: When physical distancing isn't possible, students will have to be organized into cohorts of no more than 75, and minimize contact with others. In these cases, there must be at least one metre between their desks.

Physical distancing: The province says students are required to maintain a two-metre distance to ""the greatest extent possible."" When it isn't possible, physical barriers may be an option. Spaces should be arranged to encourage separation.

Masks: Masks are strongly recommended for students in Grades 5 to 12. They are required when taking the bus.

Transportation: Masks are required for students Grade 5 and up, as well as drivers, on buses. Parents are encouraged to transport their children to school if they can.

New routines: Lunch and recess are to be staggered to minimize congestion, and in many cases teachers will change classrooms instead of students.

ONTARIO

Ontario students will be back in class September, but their schedules and class sizes may vary depending on where they live.

Back to class: Elementary students and many high schoolers will be in school five days a week in standard class sizes. However, secondary students at two dozen boards that are higher risk will only attend class half the time, and will spend the rest of the week working on ""curriculum-linked independent work."" Parents will also have the option to keep their kids out of class, and boards must provide options for remote learning.

Groups: For high schoolers in high-risk districts, class sizes will be capped at 15. Meanwhile, elementary students won't be broken up into smaller groups, but will be grouped into cohorts and their exposure to different teachers will be limited.

Physical distancing: While Education Minister Stephen Lecce said the aim is to keep students one metre apart from each other, a guidance document says only that schools should promote ""as much distancing as possible"" rather than being strictly enforced.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 through 12, and will be strongly encouraged for younger kids when they're in indoor common areas. Staff will be expected to wear masks.

Transportation: Some school boards may have more than one student assigned to a seat. When physical distancing isn't possible, masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 to 12, and younger students will be encouraged but not required to do the same.

New routines: Students in some districts will have to pre-register for in-person schooling. Some schools may limit or even ban visitors, including parents. Breaks will be scheduled to allow students to wash their hands.

---

QUEBEC

All elementary and high school students in Quebec will be required to attend class in September unless they have a doctor's note indicating they're at high risk of COVID-19 complications or they live with someone at risk. Those students will be allowed to study remotely.

Back to class: Class attendance is mandatory for elementary and high school students. For Grades 10 and 11, schools have the option of alternating schedules where students attend one day out of every two — as long as schools cannot maintain stable classroom bubbles. Grade 10 and 11 students are encouraged to attend classes as much as possible.

Groups: Each classroom will be its own bubble and students will not be required to maintain a two-metre distance between classmates.

Physical distancing: Students will need to keep a two-metre distance from all school staff, as well as all other students outside their classroom bubble. There are no physical distancing requirements for children or teachers in pre-school.

Masks: All students in Grade 5 and up — as well as all school staff — must wear a mask inside all common areas of the school except the classroom. Masks can also be removed when students are eating.

Transportation: No more than 48 students will be allowed on a school bus, with no more than two students sitting on the same bench. Preschool and elementary school students are strongly encouraged to wear masks, while older students are required to wear them.

New routines: When schools return in the fall, teachers will move from classroom to classroom, but students will stay put.

Backup plans: In the event of an outbreak in one class, the entire classroom bubble will be sent home to continue studies remotely. Authorities are also putting together an emergency protocol in the event of a second wave to ensure instruction continues online if entire schools are again forced to close. Ideas include quickly distributing tablets or laptops to students needing them and establishing a digital platform to continue courses and maintain communication.

NEW BRUNSWICK

The province has outlined a set of requirements schools must follow in developing their plans for the fall.

Back to class: Students in kindergarten to Grade 8 are to attend school full time, while those in Grades 9 to 12 are to be taught using a combination of in-class and remote instruction. At-home course work can include online learning, guided projects and experiential education.

Groups: For kindergarten through Grade 2, group sizes will be reduced to about 15, wherever possible. Group sizes should also be shrunk for Grades 3 to 5. Grades 6 to 8 will resume at regular class sizes. Students in Grades 9 to 12 will not be grouped because of their schedules and course options.

Physical distance: Grade 9 to 12 classrooms are required to maintain a one-metre distance, while a two-metre distance is recommended in common areas at all grade levels.

Masks: All students will be required to bring a mask to school, but masks will not be mandatory inside the classroom. Students in Grade 6-12 must wear masks on the school bus and in common areas of school buildings, while children in kindergarten to Grade 5 are encouraged to do so. Teachers for kindergarten to Grade 8 can choose whether they want to wear a mask or shield in the classroom while teachers for Grades 9-12 will be required to wear one when they cannot physically distance from students.

Transportation: Curtains will be installed inside school buses to separate drivers from students. If physical distancing is not possible, drivers will be required to wear a mask or face shield. Students must sit in the same seat every day. Students in kindergarten to Grade 5 will sit alone or with a member of their household. Students in Grades 6-12 wearing masks will sit two to a seat, and if they are sitting alone or with a member of their household, they do not have to wear a mask.

New routines: Arrivals, breaks and lunches are to be staggered. Public access to school buildings will be limited, and students, staff and visitors may also be subject to screening. High school students will be expected to have their own laptop or similar device, and some subsidies will be available. Drinking fountains will be replaced with water bottle-filling stations.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND

Schools on the Island are preparing to welcome all students back to class, while drafting backup plans for remote studies if required.

Back to class: Schools are to reopen for teachers and staff on Sept. 1 and for students on Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be organized into cohorts when possible and limit their exposure to others.

Physical distancing: Students will be taught about the importance of physical distancing, and extra teaching and cleaning staff may be hired. Schools are also asked to reduce class sizes as much as possible, reconfigure classrooms and make use of spaces such as libraries and multipurpose rooms.

Masks: The province says all staff and students in Grades 7-12 are ""strongly recommended"" to wear masks when physical distancing cannot be maintained. Students from kindergarten through Grade 6 may wear masks when physical distancing is impossible. Staff interacting with children who have complex medical needs are strongly recommended to wear face shields and gloves.

Transportation: Parents are asked to take their kids to school whenever possible. To reduce the number of riders on buses, schools may add vehicles and routes or implement walk-to-school programs. It is strongly recommended that all students and drivers wear masks on the bus.

New routines: P.E.I. education authorities are revising curricula for this school year to make up for learning gaps caused by lockdown constraints. Schools will stagger schedules to minimize congestion. The provincial school food program will be expanded next year in keeping with public health precautions. Elementary school students will stay in their classrooms for lunch.

NOVA SCOTIA

Education Minister Zach Churchill says the province's objective is for schools to return to 100 per cent capacity in the fall, but its plan includes measures to address the possible onset of a second wave of COVID-19.

Back to class: The province aims to have all elementary and high school students in classrooms by Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be asked to keep to cohorts.

Physical distancing: Students and staff will be encouraged to maintain a two-metre distance whenever possible. Lecture rooms will be reorganized to increase space between desks.

Masks: All students in grades 4 to 12 will be required to wear a mask inside schools except when seated at desks that are two metres apart and facing the same direction. Masks must be worn in hallways and other common areas if a two-metre distance cannot be maintained. All students and staff will receive two free cloth masks. Disposable masks will be available if a student loses theirs or comes to school without one.

Transportation: Students who take the school bus will be required to wear non-medical masks.

New routines: Only students and staff will be permitted to enter school buildings. When possible, teachers will be asked to move their classes outdoors. Students will be asked to bring their own computers to school, and the province says it has acquired an additional 14,000 devices for those with limited access to technology. The ventilation systems of each school will be assessed to ensure the equipment is operating properly.

Backup plans: If a COVID-19 outbreak occurs during the academic year, schools will move to a blended learning model with smaller class sizes and home learning for older students.

---

NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR

The province's back-to-school plan aims to maximize in-class attendance with the option of a return to remote learning if the COVID-19 risk increases.

Back to class: The province's plan outlines three scenarios — in-class instruction, remote learning or a combination of both, depending on the COVID-19 risk in a particular community. The Newfoundland and Labrador English School District said in person classes will resume in September given low case numbers in the province and families can apply to homeschool their children.

Groups: Cohorting by class is recommended when feasible, but students' schedules shouldn't be disrupted to support smaller groupings. In the English School District, high school students will not be grouped by cohorts due to curriculum requirements.

Physical distancing: Schools should aim to create a two-metre distance between desks, or as close to that as possible. The English School District says signage will be placed inside schools reminding people about physical distancing.

Masks: Masks must be worn on school buses and in communal areas of high schools but they are not required inside classrooms. Staff will not be required to wear masks if physical distancing is possible. The province's English School District will provide two masks for each teacher and one for each student.

Transportation: Bus drivers and riders will be required to wear masks. The English School District has said bus ridership will be limited to 46 students per bus and up to 6,000 students may need to make alternate transportation arrangements.

New routines: All students must bring their own supplies in keeping with a ""no sharing"" policy. Students are advised to bring their own water bottles.

Backup plans: In the event of moderate-to-widespread transmission of COVID-19, school districts will move to online learning. Classroom attendance should be limited to about 50 per cent when the COVID-19 risk in a community is considered low to moderate. Newfoundland and Labrador says it will spend $20 million to purchase laptops for teachers and students in Grades 7 through 12 to support remote learning.

YUKON

The territorial government says it's making plans for the next school year that include flexibility around the number of students in classes if there's a second wave of COVID-19 or increased risk of transmission. It says each school will determine how it will adjust its operations to meet those guidelines, and school principals and staff are expected to share that information prior to September.

Back to class: Preliminary plans indicate that in rural communities, all students will return to school full time. In Whitehorse, however, kids in kindergarten through Grade 9 will return to full-day in-school instruction, while Grades 10 to 12 will spend half their day in the classroom, and the rest learning remotely.

Groups: Class sizes may be smaller to meet safety restrictions.

Masks: Wearing masks is a personal choice.

Transportation: Bus school and schedules will be posted to the territory's website.

New routines: Schedule shakeups may mean that some students won't have their regular teacher or the same classmates. School meal programs may be adapted with new safety measures and pickup options.

Backup plans: The territory has outlined a spectrum of school options if the risk to the community increases, ranging from rotating schedules to suspension of face-to-face learning.

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES

All N.W.T. schools have submitted plans to reopen their doors this fall. The territory says education authorities are taking a flexible approach in their planning to account for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall.

Back to class: While plans will vary from school to school, the territory will offer in-person instruction whenever possible, while ensuring alternative options are available.

Groups: Students in kindergarten through Grade 6 will be in classroom ""bubbles,"" and won't have to practise physical distancing within these groups.

Physical distancing: For Grades 7 to 9, students are asked to maintain a one-metre distance from each other, and two-metre distance from staff. Grade 10 to 12 students are asked to allow for two metres of distance from their peers and instructors.

Masks: Students of all ages may be required to wear masks in situations where physical distance cannot be practised, such as moving through the hallways.

Transportation: There may be changes to bus schedules, and all riders will be required to wear masks.

New routines: More time will be spent learning outside. School hours and schedules may also look different. Students are asked to label personal items and not share.

Backup plans: The territory says schools are preparing to shift between in-person, distance and blended learning at short notice should there become active COVID-19 cases.

---

NUNAVUT

The territory has released a four-stage plan for reopening schools based on the risk of the novel coronavirus in a community.

Back to class: There are no reported COVID-19 cases in Nunavut, so all schools are set to reopen this fall with enhanced cleaning and safety precautions.

Groups: It is recommended that schools cohort students by class and limit mixing as much as possible.

Physical distancing: Distance requirements will depend on what stage a community is in, and will primarily be achieved by limiting school attendance.

Masks: In most cases, the use of masks is not recommended for children. If there are exceptions, parents will be notified, and masks will be provided.

Transportation: As it stands, bus schedules are set to resume. Students older than 13 may be required to wear masks.

New routines: Group activities will be limited. Students won't be allowed to share food in lunchrooms.

Backup plans: The territory says schools could go part-time if contact tracing were to identify a possible source of COVID-19. All schools would be closed if community transmission were to take place.

Masks: Masks are strongly recommended for students in Grades 5 to 12. They are required when taking the bus.

Transportation: Masks are required for students Grade 5 and up, as well as drivers, on buses. Parents are encouraged to transport their children to school if they can.

New routines: Lunch and recess are to be staggered to minimize congestion, and in many cases teachers will change classrooms instead of students.

ONTARIO

Ontario students will be back in class September, but their schedules and class sizes may vary depending on where they live.

Back to class: Elementary students and many high schoolers will be in school five days a week in standard class sizes. However, secondary students at two dozen boards that are higher risk will only attend class half the time, and will spend the rest of the week working on ""curriculum-linked independent work."" Parents will also have the option to keep their kids out of class, and boards must provide options for remote learning.

Groups: For high schoolers in high-risk districts, class sizes will be capped at 15. Meanwhile, elementary students won't be broken up into smaller groups, but will be grouped into cohorts and their exposure to different teachers will be limited.

Physical distancing: While Education Minister Stephen Lecce said the aim is to keep students one metre apart from each other, a guidance document says only that schools should promote ""as much distancing as possible"" rather than being strictly enforced.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 through 12, and will be strongly encouraged for younger kids when they're in indoor common areas. Staff will be expected to wear masks.

Transportation: Some school boards may have more than one student assigned to a seat. When physical distancing isn't possible, masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 to 12, and younger students will be encouraged but not required to do the same.

New routines: Students in some districts will have to pre-register for in-person schooling. Some schools may limit or even ban visitors, including parents. Breaks will be scheduled to allow students to wash their hands.

QUEBEC

All elementary and high school students in Quebec will be required to attend class in September unless they have a doctor's note indicating they're at high risk of COVID-19 complications or they live with someone at risk. Those students will be allowed to study remotely.

Back to class: Class attendance is mandatory for elementary and high school students. For Grades 10 and 11, schools have the option of alternating schedules where students attend one day out of every two — as long as schools cannot maintain stable classroom bubbles. Grade 10 and 11 students are encouraged to attend classes as much as possible.

Groups: Each classroom will be its own bubble and students will not be required to maintain a two-metre distance between classmates.

Physical distancing: Students will need to keep a two-metre distance from all school staff, as well as all other students outside their classroom bubble. There are no physical distancing requirements for children or teachers in pre-school.

Masks: All students in Grade 5 and up — as well as all school staff — must wear a mask inside all common areas of the school except the classroom. Masks can also be removed when students are eating.

Transportation: No more than 48 students will be allowed on a school bus, with no more than two students sitting on the same bench. Preschool and elementary school students are strongly encouraged to wear masks, while older students are required to wear them.

New routines: When schools return in the fall, teachers will move from classroom to classroom, but students will stay put.

Backup plans: In the event of an outbreak in one class, the entire classroom bubble will be sent home to continue studies remotely. Authorities are also putting together an emergency protocol in the event of a second wave to ensure instruction continues online if entire schools are again forced to close. Ideas include quickly distributing tablets or laptops to students needing them and establishing a digital platform to continue courses and maintain communication.

NEW BRUNSWICK

The province has outlined a set of requirements schools must follow in developing their plans for the fall.

Back to class: Students in kindergarten to Grade 8 are to attend school full time, while those in Grades 9 to 12 are to be taught using a combination of in-class and remote instruction. At-home course work can include online learning, guided projects and experiential education.

Groups: For kindergarten through Grade 2, group sizes will be reduced to about 15, wherever possible. Group sizes should also be shrunk for Grades 3 to 5. Grades 6 to 8 will resume at regular class sizes. Students in Grades 9 to 12 will not be grouped because of their schedules and course options.

Physical distance: Grade 9 to 12 classrooms are required to maintain a one-metre distance, while a two-metre distance is recommended in common areas at all grade levels.

Masks: All students will be required to bring a mask to school, but masks will not be mandatory inside the classroom. Students in Grade 6-12 must wear masks on the school bus and in common areas of school buildings, while children in kindergarten to Grade 5 are encouraged to do so. Teachers for kindergarten to Grade 8 can choose whether they want to wear a mask or shield in the classroom while teachers for Grades 9-12 will be required to wear one when they cannot physically distance from students.

Transportation: Curtains will be installed inside school buses to separate drivers from students. If physical distancing is not possible, drivers will be required to wear a mask or face shield. Students must sit in the same seat every day. Students in kindergarten to Grade 5 will sit alone or with a member of their household. Students in Grades 6-12 wearing masks will sit two to a seat, and if they are sitting alone or with a member of their household, they do not have to wear a mask.

New routines: Arrivals, breaks and lunches are to be staggered. Public access to school buildings will be limited, and students, staff and visitors may also be subject to screening. High school students will be expected to have their own laptop or similar device, and some subsidies will be available. Drinking fountains will be replaced with water bottle-filling stations.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND

Schools on the Island are preparing to welcome all students back to class, while drafting backup plans for remote studies if required.

Back to class: Schools are to reopen for teachers and staff on Sept. 1 and for students on Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be organized into cohorts when possible and limit their exposure to others.

Physical distancing: Students will be taught about the importance of physical distancing, and extra teaching and cleaning staff may be hired. Schools are also asked to reduce class sizes as much as possible, reconfigure classrooms and make use of spaces such as libraries and multipurpose rooms.

Masks: The province says all staff and students in Grades 7-12 are ""strongly recommended"" to wear masks when physical distancing cannot be maintained. Students from kindergarten through Grade 6 may wear masks when physical distancing is impossible. Staff interacting with children who have complex medical needs are strongly recommended to wear face shields and gloves.

Transportation: Parents are asked to take their kids to school whenever possible. To reduce the number of riders on buses, schools may add vehicles and routes or implement walk-to-school programs. It is strongly recommended that all students and drivers wear masks on the bus.

New routines: P.E.I. education authorities are revising curricula for this school year to make up for learning gaps caused by lockdown constraints. Schools will stagger schedules to minimize congestion. The provincial school food program will be expanded next year in keeping with public health precautions. Elementary school students will stay in their classrooms for lunch.

NOVA SCOTIA

Education Minister Zach Churchill says the province's objective is for schools to return to 100 per cent capacity in the fall, but its plan includes measures to address the possible onset of a second wave of COVID-19.

Back to class: The province aims to have all elementary and high school students in classrooms by Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be asked to keep to cohorts.

Physical distancing: Students and staff will be encouraged to maintain a two-metre distance whenever possible. Lecture rooms will be reorganized to increase space between desks.

Masks: All students in grades 4 to 12 will be required to wear a mask inside schools except when seated at desks that are two metres apart and facing the same direction. Masks must be worn in hallways and other common areas if a two-metre distance cannot be maintained. All students and staff will receive two free cloth masks. Disposable masks will be available if a student loses theirs or comes to school without one.

Transportation: Students who take the school bus will be required to wear non-medical masks.

New routines: Only students and staff will be permitted to enter school buildings. When possible, teachers will be asked to move their classes outdoors. Students will be asked to bring their own computers to school, and the province says it has acquired an additional 14,000 devices for those with limited access to technology. The ventilation systems of each school will be assessed to ensure the equipment is operating properly.

Backup plans: If a COVID-19 outbreak occurs during the academic year, schools will move to a blended learning model with smaller class sizes and home learning for older students.

---

NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR

The province's back-to-school plan aims to maximize in-class attendance with the option of a return to remote learning if the COVID-19 risk increases.

Back to class: The province's plan outlines three scenarios — in-class instruction, remote learning or a combination of both, depending on the COVID-19 risk in a particular community.

Groups: Cohorting by class is recommended when it's feasible, but students' schedules shouldn't be disrupted to support smaller groupings.

Physical distancing: Schools should aim to create a two-metre distance between desks, or as much distance as possible. However, provincial authorities say these precautions should not interfere with the daily school routine, and strict physical distancing should not be ""over-emphasized"" to children, because it is not practical and can cause psychological harm.

Masks: The province does not recommend masks for children, but says their use should not be ""stigmatized"" for those that choose to wear them. Staff will not be required to wear masks if physical distancing is possible.

Transportation: It will be up to school districts to determine their transportation operations, considering precautions such as assigning seats and separating the driver with a physical divider.

New routines: All students must bring their own supplies in keeping with a ""no sharing"" policy.

Backup plans: In the event of moderate-to-widespread transmission of COVID-19, school districts will move to online learning. Classroom attendance should be limited to about 50 per cent when the COVID-19 risk in a community is considered low to moderate. Newfoundland and Labrador says it will spend $20 million to purchase laptops for teachers and students in Grades 7 through 12 to support remote learning.

YUKON

The territorial government says it's making plans for the next school year that include flexibility around the number of students in classes if there's a second wave of COVID-19 or increased risk of transmission. It says each school will determine how it will adjust its operations to meet those guidelines, and school principals and staff are expected to share that information prior to September.

Back to class: Preliminary plans indicate that in rural communities, all students will return to school full time. In Whitehorse, however, kids in kindergarten through Grade 9 will return to full-day in-school instruction, while Grades 10 to 12 will spend half their day in the classroom, and the rest learning remotely.

Groups: Class sizes may be smaller to meet safety restrictions.

Masks: Wearing masks is a personal choice.

Transportation: Bus school and schedules will be posted to the territory's website.

New routines: Schedule shakeups may mean that some students won't have their regular teacher or the same classmates. School meal programs may be adapted with new safety measures and pickup options.

Backup plans: The territory has outlined a spectrum of school options if the risk to the community increases, ranging from rotating schedules to suspension of face-to-face learning.

---

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES

All N.W.T. schools have submitted plans to reopen their doors this fall. The territory says education authorities are taking a flexible approach in their planning to account for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall.

Back to class: While plans will vary from school to school, the territory will offer in-person instruction whenever possible, while ensuring alternative options are available.

Groups: Students in kindergarten through Grade 6 will be in classroom ""bubbles,"" and won't have to practise physical distancing within these groups.

Physical distancing: For Grades 7 to 9, students are asked to maintain a one-metre distance from each other, and two-metre distance from staff. Grade 10 to 12 students are asked to allow for two metres of distance from their peers and instructors.

Masks: Students of all ages may be required to wear masks in situations where physical distance cannot be practised, such as moving through the hallways.

Transportation: There may be changes to bus schedules, and all riders will be required to wear masks.

New routines: More time will be spent learning outside. School hours and schedules may also look different. Students are asked to label personal items and not share.

Backup plans: The territory says schools are preparing to shift between in-person, distance and blended learning at short notice should there become active COVID-19 cases.

---

NUNAVUT

The territory has released a four-stage plan for reopening schools based on the risk of the novel coronavirus in a community.

Back to class: There are no reported COVID-19 cases in Nunavut, so all schools are set to reopen this fall with enhanced cleaning and safety precautions.

Groups: It is recommended that schools cohort students by class and limit mixing as much as possible.

Physical distancing: Distance requirements will depend on what stage a community is in, and will primarily be achieved by limiting school attendance.

Masks: In most cases, the use of masks is not recommended for children. If there are exceptions, parents will be notified, and masks will be provided.

Transportation: As it stands, bus schedules are set to resume. Students older than 13 may be required to wear masks.

New routines: Group activities will be limited. Students won't be allowed to share food in lunchrooms.

Backup plans: The territory says schools could go part-time if contact tracing were to identify a possible source of COVID-19. All schools would be closed if community transmission were to take place.

You seem to be thriving at the moment and long may it continue. The approaching new moon means that whatever efforts you make over the next few days the rewards will be considerable, so create something good and enjoy it to the full.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

It's not like you to get emotional but something has forced your feelings to the surface and over the next few days no one will be left in any doubt what they are. Try to be positive in all situations and always keep a smile on your face.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

If you are in a position where you can break away from your usual environment for a while then don't hesitate, just go for it. If you have to stay right where you are though there's still plenty you can do to make life more exciting. Use your imagination.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

Now is the time to get serious about a money matter you have been deliberately avoiding in recent weeks. The upcoming new moon will bring with it the solution you require and it won't be long before you wonder what all the fuss was about.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

This is the ideal time to clear out some of the junk in your life. In fact, the more you manage to get rid of now the more room you will create for the universe to bring in something better in the near future. Be ruthless with yourself.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

It would appear that you are involved in a situation you don't know much about and now you feel out of your depth. Like it or not you will have to put your hand up today and ask for assistance from those in a position to rescue you.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

What can you do to make life more enjoyable for the people around you? Friendships are under excellent stars at the moment and the more you do for others now the more will be done for you later on — although that's not your motivation, of course.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

If you want something enough you will find a way to get it, especially on the career front as you are determined to prove yourself and move up in the world. Just remember there is often a price to be paid for success. Make sure you can afford it.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

The approaching new moon will open your eyes to new possibilities and the more you are willing to believe that great things are possible the more the universe will send opportunities your way. Don't be too rigid in your thinking. An open mind is a winning mind.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

There is no point feeling guilty about things you said or did in the past. It may be natural to experience some remorse but don't overdo it. Everyone makes mistakes — yes, even a Capricorn — but not everyone learns from them. Make sure you do.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

Cosmic activity in the relationship area of your chart makes this the perfect time to reach out to the people you love and remind them how much they mean to you. Don't just assume they know they have a place in your heart — prove it to them.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

Don't waste your precious time on people who you either don't feel comfortable with or who seem to operate on a level you cannot relate to. You are under no obligation to hang around with them, so pick your moment and leave them behind.

Your ruling planet Mercury joins forces with both the Sun and Mars today, which among other things will give you a clearer idea of what changes need to be made. Once you see the logic of sweeping away the past the idea will no longer terrify you.

No matter how eager you are to press ahead with a new project you must give it more thought. Cosmic activity in the money area of your chart warns the cost of doing business may be higher than expected. It's still worth it but watch the pennies.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

Something you have been worrying about for ages will soon be no more than a distant memory, so cheer up and approach what you have to do today with a glad heart. Life is getting better by the minute and soon you won't want the days to end.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

Something that has taken up more of your time and energy than it is worth needs to be ended - now! With both the Sun and Mercury moving into your sign over the coming week you must clear the decks for action — of which there will be plenty.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

How you deal with people is always important but over the next few days you will get opportunities to make the kind of friendships that last a lifetime. Remind yourself constantly that it's not about what you achieve but how much you love and laugh.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

Listen carefully to what people who are more knowledgeable than you have to tell you today. Scorpios rarely take advice - you quite rightly trust your own inner voice - but on this occasion what you learn could save a lot of unnecessary work.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

You must be honest with yourself this week. There is no point pretending that something is working out well when clearly it's not. Make use of the Sun's last few days in one of the more dynamic areas of your chart to begin some much-needed changes.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

Your powers of persuasion will be hard to resist today, but make sure you use them for positive reasons. If you try to sweet-talk people into giving you what you desire the universe will find ways to deny you. Be open and honest about your needs.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

Cosmic activity in your opposite sign has brought a lot of surprises of late, and no small amount of joy as well. Keep those feeling of warmth and wellbeing going as long as you can. Events matter, but how you choose to react to them matters more.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

You never like making unpopular decisions but you have no choice now. Someone you love has had plenty of chances to sort themselves out but still they are making the same old mistakes. Step in and get it sorted for them — which is what they want anyway.

BIRTHDAY SUNDAY:

A Sun-Mars link on your birthday means your destiny is in your own hands. If you have a clear goal and a strong desire to be the very best at what you do, the coming year could see you breaking through to the big time — which is where you belong.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

Don't work your fingers to the bone this week, especially if most of your work is done for other people. A magnificent Sun-Mars link will energize you like never before, but it's still possible to overdo it, so be sensible about the tasks you agree to take on.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

Partners and loved ones must be allowed to do things their way this week, even if you are 100 per cent convinced it's the wrong way. As always, people learn quicker if they learn from their own mistakes, so stand back and let them get on with it.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Your social life may have been in a bit of a lull of late but it will pick up again as from today. Friends are always fun but now they will be absolutely fabulous, so don't sit at home watching TV — get out there and have a good time.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

This week's Sun-Mars link could make you a touch aggressive, so be careful what you say and who you say it to. If you go to extremes it's as good as guaranteed that someone even more extreme will come back at you, which may not be pleasant.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

The makings of success are right in front of you now but it's up to you to do something with them. Put on your best clothes and your most smiley face and greet the world with warmth, wit and wisdom. There are no limits Leo, at least not for you.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

You may feel compelled to step in and speak up for someone you think is being given a hard time for no good reason, but do you really know the whole story? It could be that on this one occasion they deserve to be chewed out a bit!

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

You are the kind of person who gets along with all sorts of people, and that talent will serve you well this week. If you find yourself in the middle of some kind of feud, offer a solution that everyone can agree on. But don't take sides.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

The Sun and Mars combine across the work and career angles of your chart, which suggests you will be a lot more ambitious than usual. By all means strive to impress important people, but don't strive too hard. Make everything you do look effortless.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

This is one of the best times of the year for you and you must seize the opportunities that are coming your way. Sometimes Sag you can be too laid-back for your own good, so make an effort to get up and get at 'em. It won't be too hard.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

If someone tries to get you to do something you don't agree with this week you must complain long and loud. Not only is it the wrong thing for you, but if you stay silent they will take that as a sign they can bully you any time they choose.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

You may not be the most patient of people but as the Sun moves through your opposite sign it would be smart to give others time to say what they need to say and do what they need to do. Not everyone thinks and acts as fast as you.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

If you need to make changes to your work situation, now is the time. This is one of those weeks when you will be able to assert yourself in ways that colleagues and employers cannot ignore. You can be quite persuasive when the mood takes you."

For example, it can be pretty basic, made by stirring hot, just-cooked macaroni into a pot of tangy, simmering cheese sauce. You can also bake mac and cheese, topped with more cheese and other toppings, until bubbly and delicious. You’ll even find recipes where cold mac and cheese is formed into balls, coated in seasoned breadcrumbs and deep-fried, until crispy and golden on the outside and molten in the middle.

A wide range of ingredients can also be added to mac and cheese to make it even more divine. The many possibilities include specialty cheeses; fresh herbs; roasted, grilled and other types of vegetables; seafood, such as lobster, crab and shrimp; smoked chicken and turkey; and meats, such as ham, pulled pork and shreds of barbecue brisket.

In today’s rather sumptuous recipe, I cooked mac and cheese in a skillet on the barbecue and flavoured it with three types of Island-made cheese and bacon.

If I now have your mouth watering and you’ve developed a big-time craving to try different types of mac and cheese, but don’t want make your own, you’re in luck.

Our Place Society, which provides support to Greater Victoria’s most vulnerable people, has organized a special event that, from Aug. 8 to Sept. 8, will see numerous restaurants serving up their own special version of mac and cheese. So far, the restaurants include 10 Acres Bistro, Aura Waterfront Restaurant and Patio, Boom & Batten, Boondocks, Chuck’s Burger Bar, Courtney Room, Crooked Goose Bistro, Frankie’s Modern Diner, Heron Rock Bistro, Il Covo Trattoria, Irish Times Pub, Smuggler’s Cove Pub, Spinnakers and Virtuous Pie.

Steven Seltzer, Our Place Society’s special events and corporate giving manager, says the idea of the event is to show support for our local culinary industry — businesses negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic that, over the years, have helped raise much-needed funds for Our Place Society.

Beyond getting to purchase and try many splendid versions of mac and cheese, whether you eat it at the restaurants noted above or get it to go, this event is also a culinary competition that will determine who makes Greater Victoria’s best mac and cheese.

To have your say, after you have tried some of the different types being offered, go to the Our Place Society website and vote for the restaurant you thought made the best mac and cheese. (Voting is open Sept. 1 to 10.) The winner will be announced at Our Place Society’s virtual Hungry Hearts fundraiser on Saturday, Sept. 12, at 5 p.m. More information about that event, including how to tune in, will also be on the Our Place Society website.

Skillet BBQ Mac and Cheese with Island Cheese and Bacon

This Vancouver Island-style mac and cheese is rich with three types of local cheese and crispy bits of bacon. Make a summer meal by serving it with a green salad adorned with cut, raw local vegetables, such as cucumbers, tomatoes, radishes and bell peppers.

Prep time: 40 minutes

Cook time: About 45 minutes

Makes: Four to six servings

2 cups elbow macaroni

4 strips of Vancouver Island bacon, cut into small cubes (see Note 1)

3 Tbsp butter, plus some for greasing

3 Tbsp all-purpose flour

2 cups warm milk (see Note 2)

1/2 cup sour cream

1/2 tsp smoked paprika

100 grams Little Qualicum Cheeseworks Qualicum spice cheese, grated (divided; see Note 3)

100 grams Natural Pastures Cheese Company aged farmhouse cheese, grated (divided; see Note 3)

• salt and white pepper, to taste

2 green onions, thinly sliced (divided)

75 grams Salt Spring Island Cheese Company goat cheese (see Note 3)

2 Tbsp panko or other dried breadcrumbs

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil to cook the macaroni. While it’s coming to a boil, place bacon in a skillet, set over medium to medium-high heat and cook until crispy. Drain fat from these bacon bits. Transfer bacon bits to a plate lined with paper towel and set it aside for now.

When water is boiling, cook macaroni until just tender, about eight to 10 minutes, depending on the brand.

While macaroni cooks, place 3 Tbsp butter in a medium-to-large-sized pot set over medium heat. When butter is melted, mix in flour and cook, stirring, two minutes.

Very slowly, while whisking, dribble and mix in 1/2 cup of the milk. Cook until the mixture becomes quite thick, and then slowly whisk in the remaining milk and sour cream.

Bring this white sauce to a simmer, stirring frequently so it does not scorch on the bottom. Simmer one minute to thicken. Remove sauce from the heat. Mix in paprika and three-quarters of the grated spice cheese, and three-quarters of the aged Farmhouse cheese. When cheese has melted, season the sauce with salt and pepper.

Preheat your barbecue until the temperature in the chamber is 375 F to 400 F (see Eric’s options).

When macaroni is cooked, drain it well. Now add it and three quarters of the green onions to the sauce and gently mix to combine.

Lightly butter the inside of 10-inch diameter cast-iron skillet (see Eric’s options). Spoon the macaroni mixture into the skillet. Top macaroni with the remaining grated cheeses, and then sprinkle on the bacon bits. Set small nuggets of the goat cheese at various points on top of the mac and cheese. Now sprinkle top of mac and cheese with the panko.

Set skillet on side of the barbecue. Close the lid and turn the heat off underneath the skillet; leave the other side of the barbecue on. Cook the mac and cheese 25 to 30 minutes, or until very hot and bubbly. As the mac and cheese cooks, check the temperature in the chamber and adjust the flame as needed to maintain the 375 to 400 F temperature.

When ready, sprinkle the mac and cheese with the remaining green onions and serve.

Note 1: Places making bacon on Vancouver Island include grocery store chain Red Barn Market (redbarnmarket.ca); small charcuterie shop the Whole Beast (thewholebeast.ca); and meat companies Hertel Meats (hertelmeats.ca) and Berryman Brother’s Meat Ltd. (berrymanfarms.ca). Hertel and Berryman bacon is available at many grocery stores and smaller foods stores.

Note 2: I warmed the milk for this recipe to just below a simmer in a 2-cup measuring cup in my microwave. It could also be warmed up in a small pot on the stove set over low heat.

Note 3: The cheeses noted in this recipe are available in the deli section of most grocery stores and smaller food stores. You will have to buy package sizes that contain more than you need here. But wrap up and refrigerate the leftover cheese and save it for a cheeseboard or other use. If you can’t find the exact type of cheese called for in the recipe, simply use one of the company’s other types of cheese that’s similar in style.

Eric’s options: If you don’t have a 10-inch cast-iron skillet, any other barbecue-friendly pan will work here as long its about 2 1/2-inches deep and holds eight to 10 cups. If you don’t have a barbecue, you could bake the mac and cheese in 375 F oven for a similar length of time.

On one recent outing, I ended up buying a cornucopia of ingredients that would be good to use in a simple summer vegetable soup — the kind of soup my mom used to make when I was a kid, where she simply threw everything into the pot and simmered it until it was ready to enjoy.

That meant cutting and cooking in stock the local vegetables I had bought, such as corn, snap-top carrots, bell peppers, zucchini, potatoes and more, with a few flavourings until tender.

You end up with an earthy-tasting, light and colourful soup whose flavour I enhanced by topping each bowl with pistou, often described as a French-style of pesto that I made with local basil and garlic.

My recipe for the soup yields about 10 to 12 servings. If that’s too many, the leftover soup will freeze well for another time. The pistou could also be frozen (see its recipe for details).

Feel free to adjust my soup recipe by adding vegetables you like and leaving out those you don’t care for. The cut vegetables I added to the pot totally about nine cups, so keep that in mind if you make any substitutions.

Summer Vegetable Soup with Pistou

Here’s a light, throw-all-the vegetables-in-the-pot soup topped with basil- and garlic-rich pistou, often described as a French-style pesto. This soup, and the pistou recipe, will freeze well. So enjoy some now and freeze the rest for another time.

Preparation time: 30 minutes

Cooking time: 20 minutes

Makes: about 10 to 12 servings

1 cob of corn

2 to 3 medium snap-top carrots, scrubbed well, and then sliced (see Note 1)

1 medium green bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch cubes

1 medium yellow bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch cubes

1 lb (about 4) large nugget or white-skinned potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes

3 to 4 ripe roma tomatoes, halved and cut into 1/2-inch cubes

1/2 medium zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch cubes

1 small to medium leek, white and pale green part only, cut into 1/2-inch cubes

8 cups chicken or vegetable stock or broth (see Note 2)

2 tsp herbes de Provence (see Note 3)

1 bay leaf

• splash or 2 red wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar

• salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

• pistou (see recipe below)

Shuck corn and then, with a sharp knife, cut the kernels off the cob.

Place corn kernels in a large soup pot and add the carrots, bell peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, zucchini, leek, stock (or broth), herbes de Provence, bay leaf and vinegar.

Set pot over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Now lower the heat until the stock (or broth) is gently simmering (small bubbles should just break on the surface). Simmer the soup, uncovered, 15 to 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Taste the soup and season with salt and pepper, as needed.

Ladle soup into bowls and let diners top theirs with a spoon or two of the pistou.

Note 1: Snap-top carrots are bunches of carrots sold with their green tops attached. If they’re very fresh, you don’t need to peel them — just scrub them well before slicing. If desired, you can slice some of the green tops and add them to the soup, too.

Note 2: If using store-bought stock (or broth), two 946 mL containers of it should yield the amount needed here.

Note 3: Herbes de Provence is a French-style blend of dried herbs sold in the bottled herb and spice aisle of most supermarkets.

Pistou

This French-style, fresh basil-rich sauce is great to spoon on or swirl into soup. It can also be tossed into pasta or served as an accompaniment for such things as grilled meats, sausages and chicken, fish and grilled vegetables.

Preparation time: 10 minutes

Cooking time: None

Makes: about 1 1/4 cups

36 large basil leaves, stems removed (see Note)

3/4 cup freshly and finely grated, loosely packed Parmesan cheese (about 40 grams, don’t use the dried powdered type)

6 medium to large garlic cloves

3 Tbsp tomato paste

1/2 tsp sea salt, or to taste

2/3 to 3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil

Place basil, cheese, garlic, tomato paste and salt in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. With the food processor running, slowly pour the oil down its feed tube, stopping when you’re happy with the consistency of the pistou.

Refrigerate the pistou in a tightly sealed jar until needed. It will keep at least a week. The pistou could also be frozen in ice-cube trays, unmoulded and kept frozen in freezer bags or containers until needed.

Note: The large basil leaves I used when testing the recipe were about three to four inches long.

There are several different movement disorders that affect the face, some of which can cause tics, which is what it sounds like you are describing. Tics can occur by themselves, or in the context of another neurological condition. A good example of this is Tourette’s syndrome, which has a wide range of clinical expressions and does not always look the way it is portrayed in movies.

Some movement disorders are related to medication use, so a neurologist evaluating you would do not only a careful exam, but a thorough review of past medication use.

Dear Dr. Roach: I’ve heard of a new treatment for enlarged prostate. It’s called PAE. I understand it is a procedure that restricts blood flow to the prostate, causing it to shrink. Have you heard of it and any downsides?

W.G.

Prostate artery embolization uses plastic beads to block the arteries in the prostate, causing cell death and shrinkage of the prostate. In theory, that will improve symptoms of enlarged prostate.

It is a new procedure, and the benefits and risks are not as well understood as they are for more commonly used procedures. Complications, especially urinary retention, can happen up to 26 per cent of the time. Post-PAE syndrome has been described. It includes a burning sensation, nausea and vomiting. Given the lack of certainty about the relative effectiveness about this procedure compared with traditional options, the American Urological Association has recommended PAE be used only in the setting of a clinical trial.

Dear Dr. Roach: Can you get irritable bowel syndrome by living in a tropical climate? I moved to South Florida 15 years ago and have had this problem ever since. When I go up North, I have no symptoms within 24 hours. My gastroenterologist, who moved his practice from Pennsylvania to Florida, said he has never seen so many patients with IBS since his move. He has said he suspects there may be an irritant in the air or water that causes this. Any thoughts?

Anon.

IBS is a very common condition and is frequently not formally diagnosed. Ten to 15 per cent of North Americans meet criteria, and more women have it than men in North America. There have been several studies looking at geographic distribution of IBS, but there is no definitive increase in warmer climates.

The underlying causes of IBS are not known precisely, and no clear irritant in food or water has been found. Stress might cause IBS to worsen, so that’s a possibility. You might also be eating differently when you go back to Pennsylvania.

R.H.

I am sure you must be frustrated with the lack of diagnosis and continued symptoms.

Abdominal migraine does indeed cause recurrent abdominal pain, and many people with it have had extensive evaluations before the diagnosis is made. However, migraine of any kind starting in the 60s is uncommon. Abdominal migraine is more common in children. Further, most people with abdominal migraine have other migraine syndromes, such as headache, though it is possible to have abdominal symptoms alone.

The location of abdominal migraine is most commonly around the umbilicus.

Pain often begins suddenly and lasts an hour or more. The pain must be associated with at least two of the following: nausea, vomiting, headache, loss of appetite or pallor (the medical term for the unhealthy pale appearance of a person who is acutely ill).

Often, if the diagnosis is suspected, a trial of anti-migraine medication can confirm the diagnosis if successful.

There are many. Of course, a thorough evaluation for other causes of abdominal pain are mandatory before making the diagnosis of abdominal migraine.

One good place to read more is on Yale Medicine’s webpage for abdominal migraine, yalemedicine.org/conditions/abdominal-migraine/.

Dear Dr. Roach: I am a healthy 71-year-old woman of normal weight. I had a pacemaker put in back in December 2019 due to heart block. I had a low heart rate of 37, which caused periodic shortness of breath and trouble walking for exercise without becoming dizzy and lightheaded and feeling like I would pass out. Things are much better since the pacemaker was put in, but I still feel like my heart rate goes high quickly with little exertion, such as just walking to the mailbox. My cardiologist says that should improve as I continue to exercise more. Should I be concerned?

P.B.

Your cardiologist is very likely correct. People with heart block, like many heart issues, often subconsciously decrease their exertion.

This leads to deconditioning, and a regular exercise program is the correct treatment. If you aren’t getting back to normal, the cardiologist may want to take a look at heart function with an echocardiogram.

Last year I started to have asymptomatic PVCs. I also have prediabetes and mild high blood pressure. I am on 100 milligrams of Lopressor twice daily. I had a negative stress test. My cardiologist wants to reduce the frequency of the PVCs to less than 10%. Is there any good scientific rationale to this approach?

R.D.

article continues below

Premature ventricular contractions — PVCs — are early heartbeats. An average person might have 500 of them daily. You are having a great deal more than average: more than 10% of your beats. If you have 100,000 heartbeats daily, that’s more than 10,000 PVCs.

Too many PVCs may cause symptoms in some people, but it can also cause damage to the heart, leading to heart failure in a few people. That kind of heart damage is more common in people with longer “runs” of PVCs, which you apparently don’t have.

While there are medications to stop them, it’s not clear that doing so is a good idea. Old trials, using medication to stop PVCs around the time of a heart attack, showed that people were more likely to get dangerous rhythm disturbances if treated.

I reviewed the newer data and discussed with a colleague in electrophysiology, Dr. Gregg Shander. He, like other experts in the field, will not treat people who have no symptoms and no abnormalities in the structure or function of the heart by echocardiogram, but he would recommend a follow-up echo in six months to be sure there has been no deterioration in heart function. The beta blocker (metoprolol) you are on for high blood pressure is also one common treatment for PVCs. I don’t know of any reason to treat you further. Ask your cardiologist to explain the rationale.

Dear Dr. Roach: I’m 21 years old, and I have had trouble getting and maintaining erections since 2017. I don’t smoke or drink alcohol. What might be the possible cause?

I.A.

Erectile dysfunction is a common problem in older men, but it’s very uncommon in teenagers and young adults.

There are four major systems involved in erectile function. The heart and blood vessels need to be adequate, and while this is frequently a problem for older men with blockages, it would be rare but not impossible for a man your age.

The nerves to the penis need to be intact, and nerve damage from trauma could occasionally cause this problem. You would have known about a nerve problem after the trauma began.

Although it’s rare, I have had dedicated bicyclists note decreased erections after spending all day on the bike. The hormones of the body need to be in balance.

Low testosterone is a big issue and you should be checked, but high estrogens and prolactin also can cause ED.

Your doctor should consider testing all of these hormone levels. I’m glad you don’t smoke, but heavy cannabis use can lower testosterone enough to cause ED, even in young men.

Finally, the brain is called the primary sex organ in humans for good reason: Psychological or relationship issues can cause difficulty with erections. Most 21-year-olds are transitioning from their pediatrician or adolescent medicine specialist to an adult medicine doctor, but any GP should be able to evaluate what might be going on.

Many people experience cracking in the skin of the heel. Dry skin is the most common cause, and proper footwear, regular moisturizing and avoiding excess washing with harsh soaps and hot water all may help. If the problem continues, it is more likely an inflammatory condition like eczema than it is a fungal or bacterial infection. Making the proper diagnosis will help guide treatment, which may include steroid ointments or even glue to repair the cracking. A podiatrist or dermatologist would be a good first stop.

Dear Dr. Roach: My 80-year-old wife recently began to have tremors in her left leg while walking with her walker. After looking at MRIs of her back, her orthopedic doctor said everything looked OK and recommended she see a neurologist. Can a neurologist help?

B.R.

Tremor in one body area should indeed be evaluated by a neurologist. The list of possibilities is too long to summarize, but knowing that the tremor is restricted to one leg and only occurs with movement will help the neurologist start to narrow down the possibilities.

Once she has a diagnosis, then the neurologist can discuss the options for treatment.

""We have been consistent that testing is an important part of ensuring a safe workplace for Equity performers, and today, I’m pleased to see that Disney World has agreed,"" Kate Shindle, president of Actors’ Equity Association, said in a statement.

Disney officials said in a notice to its workers that there would be a dedicated testing lane for its workers and their families, and that reservations could be made for testing starting Thursday.

""As a reminder, testing is voluntary and Cast Members will not be paid for testing time,"" the notice said.

Actors’ Equity Association filed a labour grievance against Disney World, saying its members faced retaliation for demanding the coronavirus tests before Disney World's theme parks reopened to visitors last month after being closed since March because of the pandemic. About 220 actors and singers initially were called back to work, but that invitation was rescinded after the union made public its concerns about the lack of testing, according to the union.

It was unclear how many actors and singers would be called back now that an agreement has been signed.

The relaunch on Nov. 8 will allow all members to book seats on any Air Canada flight using Aeroplan points, a change from the current model where seat inventory is limited.

It will eliminate the carrier surcharge — which varies from less than $25 to the high hundreds — on flights purchased with points, though a $39 fee applies for trips operated by Air Canada's partner airlines.

Members will also be able to share points with up to eight friends and family members, combining them in a pool anyone in the group may put toward a trip.

The airline hopes the relaunch, planned after it reacquired the rewards program from Aimia Inc. in January 2019, will add another two million members before 2024 to the five million-plus who already hold Aeroplan cards.

The new program, based in part on feedback from thousands of consumers, ""is more important than ever as airlines compete to earn and retain customer loyalty in a rapidly changing environment,"" CEO Calin Rovinescu said in a statement Tuesday.

Passenger revenues at the Montreal-based airline dropped by 95 per cent year over year in its second quarter, prompting 20,000 layoffs as the airline burned through $19 million of cash per day amid border closures and a collapse in demand stemming from the coronavirus.

Air Canada made last-minute tweaks to the rewards revamp in response to the outbreak, prioritizing partnerships with the Uber Eats app and other companies yet to be announced, said Mark Nasr, head of loyalty and e-commerce at the company.

""We did a lot of soul-searching as COVID-19 developed,"" Nasr said. ""We really accelerated these 'every day' partnerships.""

The points that members earn on purchases via eligible retail, hotel and credit card partners will count toward to the tally required to reach the lowest rung of ""elite status"" — 25,000 kilometres of air travel in a year.

For example, an Uber Eats purchase of $50 would yield 100 points for Aeroplan members, and another 50 to 75 points if it was made through a TD Aeroplan Visa card.

Frequent travellers in one of Aeroplan's five elite categories will be able to share benefits such as lounge access and priority boarding with friends and family, even if they are not flying together.

Current Aeroplan members will keep their account numbers and Aeroplan miles will be converted to points on a one-for-one basis, Air Canada said.

The new system will base the number of points earned for a given flight on airfare rather than distance, which currently provides the baseline. That means the points gap between a flight to Asia and a flight across the country will likely narrow, since the difference in distance is often greater than the difference in price.

Meanwhile the new, more flexible pricing model — Air Canada has posted a ""points predictor"" tool on its website — also means more popular routes and times will cost more points than under the current fixed system, while off-peak times and less popular routes will be cheaper, said National Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen.

""We see this as margin-enhancing for Air Canada as it will be able to effectively charge market prices for rewards seats for more popular flights. In addition, it will allow the airline to enhance load factors on less popular flights,"" Doerksen said in a research note.

A flight between Toronto and Vancouver will cost between 25,000 and 35,000 points, according to the points predictor.

The renewed focus on consumer spending — TD announced Tuesday a ""refreshed suite"" of Aeroplan Visa credit cards, set to launch Nov. 8 — expands the loyalty program's potential appeal well beyond the jet set.

""The cards are what drives massive amounts of value. If Bob or Betty don't travel much by air, they can still have a TD or a CIBC or Amex credit card and they can make points on the program,"" said Robert Kokonis, president of Toronto-based consulting firm AirTrav Inc.

""There's all that day-to-day household spending that you can put onto the card that really generates points for the member and through to the bottom line of Aeroplan and then Air Canada.""

The added incentive to plastic comes as a welcome change for Air Canada credit card partners Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Visa and American Express.

Air Canada has said credit card penetration for so-called elite flyers is only 38 per cent versus about 50 per cent for most U.S. airlines.

TD and CIBC paid a total of $1.2 billion to help offset the hefty points liability, acquisition price and other working capital and pension assumptions for Air Canada.

Alonso crashed in Turn 4 when his Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet dipped onto the concrete portion of the apron at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and sent the Spaniard into the retaining wall. His damaged car rolled onto pit lane for an early end to his afternoon.

Alonso was sixth on the speed chart when he crashed. He ended up ninth for the day.

""It is just the way it is,"" Alonso said. ""Fortunately it happened today and not on (race day). We will learn from this. Nothing we can do now and tomorrow we start again.""

Alonso is making his third attempt to win the final leg of motorsports' version of the Triple Crown. The two-time Formula One champion has victories in the Monaco Grand Prix and 24 Hours of Le Mans, with Indianapolis the only race missing from the trifecta.

He had a strong car in 2017 when he raced at Indianapolis for Andretti Autorsport but an engine failure ended his shot at victory. Alonso failed to qualify for the Indy 500 last year in an effort from McLaren.

He also crashed during Indy 500 practice last year and it contributed to the many setbacks the McLaren team had during its preparations. The McLaren backup car was not the proper shade of orange and Alonso lost valuable practice time as the colour was corrected.

Alonso's crash with just over 50 minutes remaining in Thursday's session was the first wreck since the track opened Wednesday for practice.

Meanwhile, five-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon topped the speed charts at the end of the day with a lap at 226.102 mph for Chip Ganassi Racing. He was followed by Takuma Sato at 225.693 and Marco Andretti at 225.249 mph as Honda's took the top three spots.

Conor Daly at 225.106 was fourth and the fastest Chevrolet.

James Hinchcliffe of Oakville, Ont., was 17th and Dalton Kellett of Stouffville, Ont., was 28th.

There is one more day of practice before qualifying, called ""Fast Friday"" as IndyCar gives teams a horsepower boost to increase speeds. Defending race winner Simon Pagenaud said Team Penske had a deliberate plan to work on handling Thursday and will worry about speed during Fast Friday practice.

""I have no interest in drafting and getting a big number out there,"" Pagenaud said. ""There's no interest for me to do that. I know I can win this race and I know what I need. That's more important than drafting and putting up a big number."""

Cole Pearn abruptly retired at the end of last year's NASCAR season after helping build one of the best teams in stock car racing. His life on the road cost him too much time with his young family and relocating from Colorado to North Carolina had limited their access to outdoor adventures.

They returned to his native Canada to operate Golden Alpine Holidays in British Columbia, a venture that has been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. Racing has also been scrambled, and when the Indianapolis 500 was moved from May to Aug. 23, one of the Ed Carpenter Racing engineers had a conflict.

It created an opening at Carpenter on Conor Daly's car. One of Carpenter's crew members had worked with Pearn before and the connection was made: Pearn, the crew chief of Martin Truex Jr.'s 2017 NASCAR championship season, would work the Indianapolis 500.

""They asked. It was like, ‘Yeah, why not?’"" said Pearn, who called the Indy 500 a bucket list event. ""It's hard when you race your whole life and just completely turn it all off. So it's kind of nice to scratch that itch at the same time.""

Daly, in his first day working with Pearn, was ninth fastest around Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The Chevrolet was even faster Thursday, when Daly briefly sat atop the speed chart before Takuma Sato bumped him down a spot. He ended the day fourth overall in speed.

""We made some really good changes overnight and Cole has an idea of what he wants to do. He's got an interesting way of working, he's like ‘Yep, I know exactly what I want to do,’"" Daly said. ""I really like communicating with him and I think we are vibing really well.""

Daly, making his seventh Indy 500 start, finished a career-best 10th in his hometown race last season while running for Andretti Autosport. A scrapper who has pieced together a full IndyCar season swapping between Carpenter for oval races and Carlin Racing for street and road course events, the 28-year-old Daly is trying to stabilize his career.

Daly will try to parlay a strong 500 into full-time work while relying on a part-time engineer in the 37-year-old Pearn.

""I’ve learned to just try to get along with everyone,"" Daly said. ""I’m a very trusting individual. Obviously, Cole has an incredible amount of experience in the racing world. Was a driver himself, as well. He knows what’s going on.""

Pearn's most noted success is in stock cars and a five-year stint as Truex's crew chief that produced 24 Cup Series victories. The team raced for the title three consecutive years, finishing second in back-to-back seasons after the 2017 championship.

Things began to change when Furniture Row Racing closed at the end of the 2018 season and Pearn and Truex were pulled into Joe Gibbs Racing. They won seven races and were runner-up to teammate Kyle Busch in the title race when Pearn decided he'd had enough.

He has since watched NASCAR on television and provides both insightful and comedic commentary on social media. Pearn recognized he missed racing.

""For sure missed the competition side,"" Pearn said. ""This is obviously a fully different experience, but racing is still racing. You throw a green and checkered.""

To prepare for Indy, Pearn took a very literal approach — ""I had to read the rule book,"" he said.

He's always followed IndyCar and his racing experience qualifies Pearn for the crossover that few expect will be a difficult transition.

""I grew up knowing these cars, it's not like it's anything crazy,"" Pearn said. ""In some regards it is kind of simple and it's just about understanding the procedures and how we set the cars up, learn how tech goes. The physics is honestly the easiest part, understanding how everything else works is the harder part.""

When Carpenter made the hire, he had no doubt bringing in Pearn would be seamless and give Daly a shot at winning the Indianapolis 500.

""I believe when you bring in smart and talented people that have a work ethic, they’re going to figure it out,"" Carpenter said. ""There’s a lot that’s different but a lot of the processes are the same. Some of the language is different. He’s definitely putting in the work to do it, getting prepared. A lot of what we’re doing at Indy is making decisions in the moment. I think we all feel like Cole has those traits."""

Michelaine Lahaie, chair of the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for RCMP, says a video shows an RCMP officer opening the door of a moving police vehicle, which hits the man.

The officer and other Mounties then use force to arrest him while he's on the ground.

Lahaie says the man was then injured in an alleged assault by another detained man in a cell at the Kinngait RCMP detachment and had to be flown to Iqaluit for medical treatment.

She says the investigation is to determine whether the conduct of the Mounties, including use of force, was reasonable.

She says in a news release that the probe will be a Public Interest Investigation into the conduct of RCMP in Kinngait.

""The RCMP members' conduct will be assessed in accordance with relevant law and RCMP policy,"" reads the terms of reference of the investigation released Tuesday.

""Consideration will also be given as to whether racial bias and/or discrimination played a role in the man's arrest and subsequent treatment.""

Lahaie noted the review she has requested by the commission is separate from an investigation by the Ottawa Police Service at the request of the Mounties and an RCMP internal Code of Conduct review.

""I am concerned with the conduct of RCMP members involved in this serious incident and will monitor both the OPS (Ottawa police) investigation and the RCMP's Code of Conduct investigation,"" Lahaie said in a release.

""The CRCC's investigation will provide an added level of scrutiny to the incident, as it will additionally examine the circumstances that led to the man being placed in a cell at the RCMP detachment where another detainee assaulted him and he needed to be airlifted to Iqaluit for treatment.

""I am aware that there is historical distrust by Inuit toward the police and I am committed to increasing RCMP accountability.""

The day after the man's arrest Nunavut Justice Minister Jeannie Ehaloak said she was outraged.

""I have seen the video from Kinngait circulating on social media and am very concerned by the unnecessary force, the violence and the lack of respect I have seen,'' she said in a release at the time.

""Nunavummiut should not fear this kind of treatment and disregard for safety and basic rights.''

Ehaloak said she would formally request a review by the commission.

The gravitas of the moment was not lost on the former journalist and mother of three. After she spoke the English words of her oath of office, she paused to take a deep breath, before repeating the oath in French.

""It's about time,"" Freeland said later at a press conference on Parliament Hill.

She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.

Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.

But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.

""There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,"" said Turnbull. ""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.""

Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.

She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.

""We don't like their representative very much,"" he said of her in September 2018.

Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said ""Mama (does not equal) chopped liver."" On the back it said ""Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.""

When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.

And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.

""She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,"" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.

He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.

""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.

""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.

""I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,"" he said. ""And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.""

She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.

""What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,"" Kelly said on Twitter. ""This has been missing in the department for several years.""

MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.

While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.

Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.

Word — The term comes through Middle English and Old French from a Latin root, prorogare, to prolong.

article continues below

Effect — Prorogation essentially ends a session of Parliament, allowing for a new beginning with a speech from the throne.

Legislation — At one time, prorogation killed all legislation before Parliament, but rule changes now provide that most bills can be revived in the new session at the same stage they were at when the previous session ended.

Committees — Committees, including special and legislative committees, cease to exist. Membership on committees, except the membership of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, is terminated and all chairs and vice-chairs no longer hold these positions.

Documents — No document may be tabled until the first day of a new session.

Quote — ""Prorogation of a session brings to an end all proceedings before Parliament. With certain exceptions, unfinished business 'dies' on the Order Paper and must be started anew in a subsequent session."" — House of Commons Procedure and Practice, Third Edition, 2017.

Length — Prorogation can be as short as a few hours, or as long as several months. During this period, the House of Commons and Senate are shut down but the government remains in power and MPs remain MPs.

Frequency — Most Parliaments are prorogued at least once and often there are several prorogations and sessions in the life of a Parliament.

Authority — Prorogation is ordered by the Governor General on the advice of the prime minister. It is not covered by statute. Rather it is a personal legal power of the Governor General and by convention the prime minister has the right to provide advice. And by convention it's actually the prime minister's decision.

Granted — Prorogation is routinely granted. In December 2008, then-governor general Michaelle Jean took a few hours before granting prorogation, but that was a thorny case because opposition parties were threatening to defeat the government and install a coalition government shortly after an election.

Ceremony — At one time, prorogation was done in a formal ceremony in the Senate chamber, but that hasn't been used in decades. A simple proclamation signed by the Governor General does the trick today.

Liberal promise — In their 2015 election platform, the Liberals said Stephen Harper's Conservatives ""used prorogation to avoid difficult political circumstances. We will not.""

Limits — Governments can't use prorogation to shut down Parliament indefinitely. That would violate the constitutional requirement that Parliament meet at least once every 12 months. And without Parliament to approve a budget and spending estimates, the government would run out of money.

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

article continues below

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

The five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations are upset that Ottawa decided to give a surplus allocation of salmon — which arose this year due to reduced recreational fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic — to commercial fishers rather than to the First Nations.

Clifford Atleo, lead negotiator for one of the nations who is also called Wickaninnish, says he feels sports and commercial troll fishers are given more rights to fish in the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

He says the latest decision to shut First Nations fishers out of an opportunity to catch more chinook salmon this year shows systemic racism is ""alive and well"" within the federal fisheries department.

""We feel very strongly we're not being dealt with fairly, we know we're not being dealt with fairly,"" Atleo said.

""It's just another layer of disappointment on the part of how the government deals with us. The government doesn't realize that their attitude toward our people is dyed-in-the-wool ... And I think the government — sometimes they don't realize they're being racist. They've got age-old policies that have never changed.""

A 2018 B.C. Supreme Court ruling directed Ottawa to take a more ""generous approach"" to allocations of chinook salmon to the First Nations given the importance of this species to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people.

The ruling from B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Humphries noted that the government's salmon allocation policy at the time gave recreational fisherman priority to fish for chinook and soho salmon ahead of the First Nations and advised the fisheries minister to reassess this policy.

Despite this ruling and changes that have since placed the First Nations at a higher priority than sport fishers, the Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ehattesaht and Mowachaht/Muchalaht nations say their yearly fishing allocations have not increased.

This year, the five First Nations were told they could fish 7,724 chinook, which amounts to just 1.5 fish per person for the 5,000 members of their communities.

COVID-19 brought a new dynamic to the salmon allocations this year, as fewer sport fishers were able to come due to pandemic restrictions. This means the recreational fleet is expected to catch 15,000 less salmon than was forecasted for this year, according to figures provided by the department.

None of this surplus is going to the First Nations.

""As per approved management plans, the Area G (commercial) harvest is adjusted based on the projected recreational harvests which results in an increase of 15,000 for 2020,"" said department spokesperson Athina Vazeos.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan was unavailable for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Jennifer Kuss, noted the improvements made in giving the five nations a higher priority in the yearly salmon catch allocations, as directed by the courts.

""This change ensures that food, social, and ceremonial (fishing) continues to be prioritized first, and additionally prioritizes the Five Nations rights-based sale fishery over the recreational and commercial fishery,"" Kuss said in a statement.

The Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations argue Ottawa could have provided some of the unused catch from this year to their people to help them support their remote communities. But Atleo said fisheries officials would not even engage in discussions about it.

""The government is trying to say they consult with us, they negotiate with us. They create their fishing plans, put it on the table and it's like take or leave it,"" Atleo said.

""All we want to do is be part of the economy, part of looking after ourselves without depending on government. We don't think that's a lot to ask.""

NDP MP Gord Johns, whose riding takes in the West Coast fishing shores, said he finds it ""disgusting"" the Trudeau government has repeatedly highlighted its desire to restore the Crown's relationship with Indigenous Peoples but has still fought many legal battles with these nations over their fishing rights.

""Indigenous people in our communities rely on this fishery for their economy, for their food security, for their culture. It's part of their way of life. These are salt water people and they rely on the salmon and to be denied their right is shameful, it's disgusting that the government is taking this approach.""

The First Nations are calling on Ottawa to revisit its decision on the surplus salmon for this year to allow them a portion of the additional catch.

""The government has an opportunity to fix this with these (surplus salmon) to come with a fair opportunity to exercise their commitment, in the judge's words, for a generous allocation to the nations and to start moving forward with reconciliation,"" Johns said.

The minister's spokeswoman says Jordan takes any allegations of systemic racism ""very seriously"" and that Ottawa is working with the five nations on a reconciliation agreement on fisheries resources, which is intended to broaden their access in the area, Kuss said.

""The road to reconciliation is a long journey, and Canada is committed to moving forward together. The department has spoken with the five nations on the reallocation of (salmon catch) on multiple occasions and that open dialogue will continue.""

The BC Wildfire Service said crews are responding to the fire on Christie Mountain about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, on the east side of Skaha Lake.

The fire is estimated at 250 hectares and firefighters on the ground are being supported by air tankers.

The service said the situation was ""rapidly evolving"" and asked everyone to stay clear of the area to avoid interfering with the operation.

The order asks residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with pets and critical items.

""We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,"" the service said in a tweet.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a ""fire of note"" on Tuesday.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was smouldering with no open flame but was considered out of control. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight.

Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Firefighters have tackled dozens of wildfires after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions.

Two fires were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

""It was nice to get on the board tonight,"" said O'Reilly.

""I haven't been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it's just one game. I've got to be consistent with it.""

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

""When we take care of the puck it's effective and it's hard on them,"" said O'Reilly.

""I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We've got to stick to our structure.""

Pietrangelo said they've been working on fixing the penalty kill.

""We've been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,"" he said.

""Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.""

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

""They're blocking a lot of shots, they're studying us. They kind of know what we're doing,"" said Miller.

He said they'll make adjustments but aren't going to go back to square one.

""We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,"" he said.

""It's not like we're getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They're a good team. We're a good team. It's going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.""

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O'Reilly, last year's Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play — the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O'Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O'Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler's stick and in.

O'Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

All Western Conference games are being played in front of no fans at Rogers Place. The players are being kept isolated in a so-called bubble between games to prevent contracting COVID-19.

They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club.","TORONTO — Richard Clune remembers the drive — the pain, the anxiety, the uncertainty, the fear.

It was the spring of 2010 and Clune, who had made his NHL debut earlier that season, was finally on the road to getting the help the 23-year-old knew he needed in his crippling addiction battle.

With his younger brother, Matt, at the wheel, they drove through upstate New York in a torrential downpour home to Toronto. Clune wasn't sure he was going to make it.

""I was in the acute withdrawal phase,"" he said in a recent interview with The Canadian Press. ""I couldn't sit still for a second. The most logical thing at that point in time for me was to go jump off a bridge ... literally.

""I couldn't really see myself coming out of it.""

But come out of it he did, and a decade later, Clune is sharing his story in ""Hi, My Name is Dicky,"" a raw documentary available on iTunes and AppleTV that details his life from aspiring youth hockey player to out-of-control junior antagonist to pro athlete teetering on the edge — one consumed by drugs, alcohol and mental illness.

His journey to recovery started in earnest on that lonely stretch of highway.

""My brother really had to talk me off the ledge,"" Clune said. ""When I see his face and when I see my other brother Ben's face, that's what gave me strength to live, because I didn't really want to live for myself at that time.

""Matt, at a couple points on that drive, had to do things that no younger brother should have to do and really dig down deep and get me home.""

The documentary from Taylor Prestidge and Haris Usanovic of Upper Canada Films tracks Clune's life and career, recovery and redemption. It includes interviews with Clune's parents, brothers, teammates and coaches.

Clune was driven to be the best as a child, but the pressure led him down a dark path at early age.

""I made that decision I was going to put my head down and not see anything but being a hockey player,"" Clune, who was selected in the third round of the 2005 NHL draft by the Dallas Stars, says in the film.

He began to try alcohol in his early teens as a way to cope, and it escalated quickly once he got to high school and then the Ontario Hockey League.

""I had this hole inside me that made me insecure and afraid of the world,"" Clune recounts. ""I got wasted and was like, 'Wow. OK. I'll be able to do this. I can cope with this. It's like a warm blanket.'

""Alcohol saved me. It was my solution to that problem of being self-absorbed and focused on all the things that made me insecure and self-conscious and in pain and sad.""

But he didn't realize how much of a spiral his life was taking. In junior, he would drive from bar to bar, party to party, drinking, smoking marjiuana and doing cocaine.

""I wanted to walk that line of looking death in the face every day, but still play hockey and do all these things,"" Clune says in the film. ""I don't know how I did it.""

Things got worse after junior when he was living in the United States by himself before making his NHL debut in that fateful 2009-10 season, months before becoming completely unglued.

""I had achieved my goal,"" he recalls on screen. ""But I hated myself.""

Clune eventually checked into rehab a second time — he went once before, but didn't stay — and committed to getting better with a lot of help from the people around him.

After he got out, he resumed his career and went onto play a total of 120 regular-season games in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Nashville Predators. His contract was bought out in 2015, and he was again at a crossroads — retire or keep going.

That's when the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were in the early stages of their massive rebuild, came calling to see if Clune wanted to be part of their program. They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club. At the very least, he would play in the minors and help foster a new culture.

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, who was in charge of the minor-league Marlies at the time, saw something in Clune that could be useful.

""He provides a certain energy,"" Dubas said. ""He provides experience in his life that I thought brought a great spirit to our team.""

Clune played 19 games with Leafs, but the forward truly made his mark with the Marlies. He helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018 and plans to continue his on-ice career, but equally important was how he's helped mentor a number of current NHLers.

He's proud of where he is, and not shy talking about how he got there. Clune still goes to meetings, does the 12 steps and now works to help others.

He also thinks a lot about why he made the decision to live, to fight, and get better, when many others — including some fellow pro hockey players — have gone down a different path.

""In the beginning, it was because I wanted to see my brothers,"" said Clune, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Then it transformed into wanting to live for myself. I started to discover what it feels like to have self esteem and to have love.

""I just hope people realize that they're not alone with how they feel. Don't be afraid to ask for help.""

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday.
""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League.

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

article continues below

""After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,"" Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal's three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first overall by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

""A low-maintenance superstar,"" said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg's senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At five foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn't blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack of getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday. ""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League. I think it was Dale's arrival that really cemented the future of the franchise and I think we all have recollections of that first year, that Calder (Trophy) year and then everything that would follow.

""He was truly a superstar as a hockey player, but I think why he was so loved here was not just that but largely the fact that he made this his home and became one of us. I think everybody shared that sense of pride in Dale's career as a player.""

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: ""All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL's all time greatest players.""

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

""What an incredible human being,"" Selanne tweeted.

Montreal Canadiens associate coach Kirk Muller also had a chance to speak with Hawerchuk in recent days.

""I talked to Dale a few days ago, and we had a good chance to chat. A good friend, had a real good opportunity to play against one of the all-time best players. As a hockey player, we all know how great he was, but he was a good friend and just a really special person, did a lot for charities. It's a real loss for us in the hockey world.""

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk ""one of the most decorated players in our game's history.""

In September 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

""For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I'm ready to fight it,"" he told TSN in October 2019. ""I want to live to tell the story.""

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie's bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames players Andrew Mangiapane and Rasmus Andersson remembered playing for Hawerchuk in Barrie.

""I don't know where I'd be without him,"" said Mangiapane. ""Very sad news today. I owe my career basically to him and the whole Barrie organization.""

Andersson, from Sweden, said ""Dale was a fantastic human being. Such a great person. My first week in Barrie he invited us over to his house and really just welcomed me to Canada. I cannot say enough good things about him as a person. Obviously a real good coach, too.""

""It's awful news.""

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday's opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at age two and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur's record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

""I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive — well maybe a little further now with the traffic,"" he said. ""I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""

""I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,"" he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and '81 with teammates that included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL's top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt like he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year — the youngest recipient at the time — and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

""Just one of the greatest. You could tell from day one. We knew from when he was 18 years old as a player that he would turn the (Jets) franchise around. Certainly one of the best I’ve ever played with and coached,"" said Dallas Stars coach Rick Bowness, who played with and coached Hawerchuk in the '80s.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

""He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,"" said Mike Doran, Winnipeg's director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the faceoff in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux's famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

""It turned out fantastic,"" said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada's call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets ""are etched in my mind every day that I live.""

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes' ring of honour.

Hawerchuk re-wrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia whom he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

""It's like going back down memory lane,"" he said in his induction speech.

""All the experiences have been fantastic,"" he added. ""I mean, sometimes they didn't feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing ... Even though I didn't win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn't change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.""

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets' Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November 2017.

""Tonight we fly Ducky's number high,"" said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue's ""Home Sweet Home,"" before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

""Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,"" said the PA announcer.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

""I've been to every part of (Manitoba), either golfing or playing (softball),"" Hawerchuk said. ""I've gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I'm honoured and I'm very humbled.""

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.

And that includes how to allow players under contract to CFL teams the ability to sign elsewhere — most notably the NFL — if the opportunity arises. On Monday, the CFL cancelled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The focus right now for us on a few certain things and one of them is ensuring if there's an ability for our players to receive some form of payment this year,"" Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA's executive director, said Monday during a conference call. ""They should be able to do that if they have an opportunity.""

While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season. However, 66 players have currently opted out of participating in the 2020 campaign, which could create opportunity for some CFL players to sign deals south of the border and have a chance to earn a football paycheque, either on the active roster or on the practice squad.

While there's no shortage of collegiate players available, the advantage a CFL player has is pro experience, a fact not lost upon NFL personnel people.

The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign. This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.

And players on NFL practice rosters receive at least US$8,000 per week.

Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the CFL is amendable to doing what it can to help its players.

""Where we can do something we will,"" he said. ""We're going to be committed to working towards good outcomes, the best possible outcomes we can have with out players.

""That's not going to mean we're going to be able to do everything but we're certainly going to go into this with a real positive spirit.""

Something else that will be on the CFL-CFLPA radar will be the current collective bargaining agreement, which is slated to expire after the 2021 season. But union president Solomon Elimimian said the two sides covered a lot of ground this time around during talks to amend the agreement for a shortened '20 season.

""Whether we deal with '21 when it comes or after the '21 season I think there's hope there that we can work together,"" Elimimian said. ""Obviously the relationship between the players and the league needs to be one where the players feel appreciated.

""Everyone wants to the league to reach its full potential. The partnership has to be one that's very genuine and the players have to feel part of that. If that happens, the sky is the limit.""

Cavan Biggio also went deep for the Blue Jays and finished with three hits and three RBIs.

Ryu (2-1) struck out three and walked none. The left-hander permitted only one runner past second base and yielded just one extra-base hit to a team that came in ranked second in the majors with a .467 slugging percentage.

Rather than vie for strikeouts, Ryu said he was focused more on getting the Orioles to hit the ball weakly.

""I was able to keep them off balance,"" he said through an interpreter.

Signed in December to an $80 million, four-year contract, Ryu got off to a shaky start with Toronto in July before showing the form he displayed as a star with the Dodgers. He's given up a total of two runs in his last three starts after allowing eight runs over nine innings in his first two outings.

""That was vintage Ryu,"" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. ""Ryu was outstanding. That's the reason we won the game.""

The two home runs were a factor, but mostly Ryu was the difference-maker.

""They didn’t give Ryu that big contract for nothing,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""You just never know what he’s going to throw. You don’t know what side of the plate he’s going to throw to. He’s really tough on right-handers because he can locate it in. You saw a lot of us get jammed.""

The Blue Jays took control with a four-run third against Alex Cobb (1-2). Three infield hits produced a run before Grichuk delivered a three-run drive over the centre-field wall. It was his third home run of the season, all in the last four games.

""Obviously, the pitch to Grichuk was middle middle and it was a poorly executed pitch,"" Cobb said. ""But most of the pitches that I had, I felt like I executed. I got the results.""

Cobb gave up five runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He’s winless in his last four starts.

After hitting 31 homers last year, Grichuk was batting fifth, sixth or seventh in the order this season before Montoyo decided to move him into the No. 2 spot Sunday to replace injured Bo Bichette. Over the past two games, Grichuk has two homers, four hits and six RBIs.

Pedro Severino and Renato Núñez had RBIs for the Orioles, who have dropped two straight after winning seven of eight.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Bichette (right knee sprain) had an MRI and will receive a second opinion on his injury, Montoyo said. Bichette leads Toronto with a .361 batting average.

Orioles: RH Dillon Tate (elbow contusion) came off the injured list and RH Evan Phillips was optioned to the team's alternate site.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: RH Nate Pearson (0-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his fourth start in his first big league season Tuesday night. Drafted 28th overall in 2017, the 23-year-old is looking to rebound after giving up four runs to Miami last week in 2 1/3 innings. ""I'm developing at the highest level,"" Pearson said Monday. ""When I don't have my best stuff, I'm going to struggle.""

Orioles: LH Wade LeBlanc (1-0, 7.13) has allowed a combined 10 runs over 12 innings in his last three starts.

DeBrusk scored twice while the Bruins scored four straight goals to rally and beat the Hurricanes 4-3 on Monday to take a 3-1 lead in their first-round playoff series.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

""We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,"" Marchand said. ""That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.""

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

""We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do — little battles,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.""

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President's Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk's first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy's hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina's captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy putaway from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston's first six post-season games.

""There's other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.""

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen's late goal.

""That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,"" Williams said. ""We got it handed to us.""

NOTES: David Pastrnak had a goal and an assist in Boston’s double-overtime win in Game 1, but hasn’t played since. He had 48 regular-season goals to tie Washington’s Alex Ovechkin for the league lead. … Carolina played without 20-year-old Andrei Svechnikov, who was injured when his leg twisted awkwardly beneath him late in the third period of Saturday's loss. ... DeBrusk scored his 12th and 13th playoff goals since his 2018 post-season debut. … The Hurricanes were also without D Joel Edmundson for the third straight game. … Jake Gardiner assisted on Williams’ first-period goal for his first post-season point with Carolina.

Rolling along the blessedly flat plain between Lucca and Pisa, under bright blue skies and with a gentle breeze at our backs, I have time to ponder some of life’s big questions, like what’s for lunch?

article continues below

Also, exactly what kind of black magic or, possibly, mathematics, is involved in keeping that tall tower on the horizon from tipping over? We’re at least five kilometres from Pisa, but we can clearly make out the iconic building with the significant tilt. From this first look, I would go so far as to call it a “leaning tower.” The closer we get, the more obvious — and dangerous-looking — is the lean. Seriously, what is keeping that thing up?

Lean into it

To answer that question, we have to first ask why it’s leaning at all. Back in 1160, Pisa had more than 10,000 towers (if you define “tower” as more than several dozen blocks piled on top of each other). Interestingly, none of those towers included a campanile, or bell tower (if you define “interestingly” as not at all interesting). Anyway, the lack of a bell tower was a problem until 1172, when local bell-tower enthusiast Berta di Bernardo died and left 60 pieces of silver to the city for the construction of a campanile.

Work began on the bell tower in 1173, led by Bonanno Pisano, a name I did not make up but wish I had. Signore Pisano was a very good sculptor, but a very bad geotechnical engineer. He did not know that beneath Piazza dei Miracoli’s lawns lay a 40-metre-deep mix of sand and clay, which is about as suitable a substrate for 56-metre-high marble buildings as banana-cream pudding.

After five years of construction, when the tower was just three storeys high, it had already started to tilt. So, in the spirit of all good municipal projects, work was put off for another 100 years.

When work resumed in 1272, the tilt was compensated for by building upward with a slight curve. The tower was eventually completed another 100 years later, in 1372. Somehow, the tower never got around to falling over — seven bells inside the tower, each sounding a different musical note, were rung from the ground by a team of 14 probably deaf men from 1370 until 1950.

Every year it leaned a little more, and by the 19th century, it was generally believed that the tower was deliberately built to lean.

In 1990, the tower was closed to the public while 1,000 tonnes of lead ingots were placed on the north side to counteract the building’s lean, and giant steel bands were wrapped around the second storey to hold it together. It didn’t work.

In 1995, the tower slipped 2.5 millimetres, prompting the insertion of more steel braces and cables while engineers removed 70 tonnes of earth from the high side of the foundations. Happily, this did work. In fact, it might have worked too well.

Not only is the tower stable, it is correcting itself toward the vertical. The latest measurements suggest that the tower’s iconic 43.8-centimetre lean might one day decrease to zero. Warning: you only have until the year 2300 before this happens.

Climbing the tower is a must-do, not just for the spectacular view of the Romanesque cityscape, but also to learn new appreciation for how good your body is at sensing when all is not plumb with the world. Climbing the well-worn 251 steps to the top floor provides a bizarre sensation of both falling forward and climbing backward as you circumnavigate the inside of the tower. The 3.9 degrees of tilt may not sound like much, but it’s very obvious to your toes.

The Leaning Tower is not the only beautiful building to explore in Pisa — or even the only one within the grounds of the Piazza dei Miracoli, which also contains the Duomo di Santa Maria Assunta, a striking 11th-century church and baptistry, and the Camposanto, said to contain soil from Calvary taken during the Crusades.

Unsurprisingly, all those famous buildings bring in the tourists, more than one million of them every year to a city of just 89,000. Such an overabundance of prey, in turn, brings in the predators, which means the usual cadre of pickpockets, North African cheap-crap-from-China merchants, and overpriced restaurants.

A day spent avoiding fistfights with all of the annoying above left me exhausted and a little glad that our cycle trip across Tuscany was officially over.

Of course, saying goodbye to the bikes and our cycle group doesn’t mean this is the end to overindulging in pasta and Chianti. We have one more stop to make before leaving Italy …

The Five Steep Lands

The Cinque Terre (Italian for “five lands”) is a string of centuries-old villages on the rugged Italian Riviera coastline: Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Cleveland, Ohio. Wait, that’s a typo, it should read Monterosso al Mare.

The most difficult thing about getting to the Cinque Terre is admitting to your wife that you are completely turned around, and have no idea where the Pisa train station is. Once this wee difficulty is sorted out (“I am almost nearly 100 per cent certain it’s over there, or possibly somewhere else. Yes, dear, yes of course, dear. By all means lead on if you think you know better”), it requires just two easy train rides, the latter of which takes eight minutes and drops you off at the bottom of the first village, stunning Riomaggiore.

When I say bottom of the first village, I refer to the mildly unpleasant fact — from the perspective of my knees — that our Airbnb is located at the top of the first village, at an elevation roughly equivalent to the base camp at Mount Everest.

This isn’t just a Riomaggiore thing; all five villages are tucked into the steep cliffs above the Mediterranean. It accounts for the stunning views, both from the bottom looking upward to the colourful homes and businesses stacked one on top of the other with vineyards and olive groves in the background; and from the top looking downward to the deep blue sea. Another plus of the steep main street (there is only one) and the myriad steep stairs and pathways, is that the farther you go up, the fewer tourists there are.

There are a lot of tourists here, naturally. The Cinque Terre is a national park and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, famed for the rugged landscape that draws hikers and sightseers from as far away as the Andromeda Galaxy.

However, it’s not actually very touristy. In fact, one of the many things I like about this place is the lack of predators looking to sell junk to the punters. This is the opposite of Pisa and Rome — it feels more like an outpost on the edge of the world, rather than the hub of an empire.

For example, there are no SPQR symbols on statues and manhole covers (also, there are no statues or manholes to cover), which are found all over the city of Rome. SPQR stands for the Latin Senatus Populusque Romanus, which means: “The senate and the people of Rome welcome your tourist dollars.”

Each of the five villages is connected by railway, water taxi and a network of hiking trails, so it’s easy to get from one to another.

Each village is unique, with its own restaurants and shops and overall atmosphere, despite the fact that they are only separated by a few kilometres. When you visit, just choose one village as your base — you can’t pick wrongly — and day-trip to the others.

We spend three days exploring the Cinque Terre, which was not nearly enough for some parts of my body, and way too much for others. Leaving this quiet, beautiful part of the world is as easy as arriving — just two train rides and we are back in in the hustle and bustle of Rome.

Ciao Italia!

Only it isn’t that easy, not really. Leaving Italy proves to be oddly disquieting. On the eve of our departure, I can’t help but wonder what just happened. Did we really spend two weeks cycling the length and breadth of Tuscany with those crazy people from all over the world?

It seems as though I have been living in a dream, as do all my adventures. Sitting alone on a whitewashed bench under a fig tree, I ponder how travel demands such good questions about the way we work and live and eat and sleep and fight and love back home.

A few bittersweet lines in Alfred, Lord Tennyson’s sublime poem Ulysses always come to mind when I am about to leave an adventure overseas for home:

For always roaming with a hungry heart

Much have I seen and known; cities of men

And manners, climates, councils, governments,

Myself not least, but honour’d of them all;

And drunk delight of battle with my peers,

Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.

I am a part of all that I have met;

Yet all experience is an arch wherethro’

Gleams that untravell’d world whose margin fades

For ever and forever when I move.

This isn’t the windy plains of Troy, nor am I honour’d for battle here, but I do well know that I am a part of all that I have met, for ever and forever when I move.

Ciao Italy.

Today is a day of wonder and discovery in northern Tuscany! After our standard 10,000-calorie breakfast, we mount up and bike off in the direction of Castelnuovo di Garfagnana, a 13th-century town nestled in a valley at the confluence of the Serchio and Territe Secca rivers.

article continues below

Let me cut to the chase and tell you about today’s main discovery: My brain turns off when I read too much Italian, as in the paragraph above. “What, exactly, is a Garfagnana?” says my brain. When nobody answers — probably a good thing — it drools.

This is despite a childhood largely devoted to televised police action dramas, featuring stereotypical Italian bad guys, sandwiched between commercials with stereotypical Italian good guys flogging Ragu and Alka Seltzer. My point is that despite all the years of TV preparation, I do not actually speak or read the lingo Italiano.

How to speak like an Italian

It’s not just the foreign-looking and strange-sounding words that make Italian such a challenge. It’s the attitude, and it’s difficult to fake. Until now:

First, touch all the fingertips of your right hand together. Now rapidly open and close your fingertips above your palm. OK, you’re almost there, just add a little wrist action. The last step is to yell loudly into a face — anybody’s face — the name of your favourite pasta and/or soccer team, over and over. That’s it! You are speaking like an Italian.

Eventually, I came to realize that not all Italians are extremely angry all of the time. They just sound that way. The Italian language, accompanied as it always is with wild arm gesticulations and finger jabs, is not meant to convey tender mercies so much as naked fury and soccer-match results. For example, the taxi driver I was convinced was threatening to murder me and my extended family was just turning left.

My wife, who is afflicted with a condition doctors describe as “smarter than me,” actually learned the Italian language prior to our trip. I was going to do that, too, but there were quite a few interesting programs on Netflix, and also there was sleeping, and beer. Anyway, my point is that learning even the basics of a language really helps in pronouncing place names, asking for directions, and choosing the right pasta for hand-to-hand combat.

A short-cut to learning Italian is to simply -—but angrily — employ one or more of the following phrases:

• Ahhhhh, now that’s Italian! (appropriate for food, traffic, leaning towers)

• That’s a spicy meatball! (appropriate for meatballs, bowel movements)

• Mama mia! (appropriate for calling your mother, Abba concerts, the Vatican)

By the way, “Garfagnana” describes the condition when you blink, and the gentle hills of Tuscany turn into the imposing wall of the Apuan Alps. Probably.

Garfagnana

The Garfagnana is gorgeous in a region that is already gorgeous. Small towns dot nearly every high spot above lush hillsides bursting with grapes, olives and everything else that’s green and growable. It’s like biking through a big salad.

In the far distance, a black dot on the ridgeline will later turn out to be a massive fortress, the Verrucole Castle.

We’re still too far away to make out the crenelated battlements high above the green valley, but we each know, deep in our thighs, that this ride will fully justify tonight’s wine, pasta and more wine.

The castle is 600 metres above sea level. It makes sense to pick a high spot for your fortress.

When bad people come to take away your stuff, such as your livestock and/or daughters, you can escape to the big impregnable castle and drop rocks on their heads until they go away.

As a plus, they might die on the seven-kilometre climb up from the valley below.

The Verrucole Castle was built between the 10th and 13th centuries by the Gherardinghi family to help keep nearby Lucca’s feudal ambitions in check.

Over the years, it has been accurately restored by a team of mostly volunteer historians, archeologists, architects and teachers, each passionate about faithful historical reconstruction.

This is the best kind of time travel: you wander around and learn how rooms and gardens were organized in the 12th century, but you get to keep your shoes and vaccinations against communicable diseases.

Well, I got to keep my shoes. A few in our group, wearing the kind of expensive cycling shoes that cause Achilles tendinitis and plantar fasciitis, had to leave them at the bottom of the steep hill you must walk up to enter the castle.

The spectacular view of the Garfagnana is worth the blisters.

The bad news is that today’s ride is 87 km long. The good news is that the first 17 km of it is all downhill. The, uh, other bad news is that the downhill begins at the top of the Apuan Alps in the rain. The temperature this morning is a crisp 4 C, and most of our group wears yesterday’s socks on their hands, not having packed for Outer Hebrides-type weather.

Despite — or possibly because of — the cold, the ride is exhilarating. We are the only ones on the road, zipping down the asphalt at automobile speeds. The narrow road precipitously drops off to the right, as the valley expands and expands and expands until we can almost see the mists of the Tyrrhenian Sea to the west.

We are the only ones on the road, right up until the moment when we suddenly share the road with large trucks burdened with giant blocks of marble, barrelling past us in what must be a concerted effort on the part of the drivers not to use up any expensive brake pads.

Italian marble — the good stuff, we are told — is quarried from these mountains, and it is cut and shipped out from the towns on the coast far below. You know you’re in one of them by the marble sidewalk curbs and public drinking fountains.

Lovely Lucca

Garfagnana has a massive hilltop fortress, whereas Lucca — on the plains 50 kilometres to the south — has a massive wall. The 4.2-km Renaissance-era wall that still encircles the old town is actually Lucca’s fourth wall, the first of which was built by the Romans when they founded Lucca by stealing it from the Etruscans in 180 BC. It outlasted the Romans by a thousand or so years, until 1118, when Lucca became a commune, or self-governing city state. The wall was expanded in 1300, and then again in 1504.

Why so many walls? You guessed it: so many wars. When gunpowder became a mainstay of Western military conflict at the end of the 15th century, high walls became an expensive liability. High walls are great for thwarting climbers, archers and biting monkeys, but they are absolutely crap against cannons. This is why the grass- and tree-topped walls around Lucca are wide enough to play a game of rugby.

Lucca was an independent city state for 700 years, becoming rich from the silk trade and good diplomatic relations with the Pope. The only army to ever breach the walls and conquer Lucca (in 1805) was that of our old pal, Napoleon Bonaparte, who — I’m mostly not making this up — began his military career as an artillery specialist and monkey handler. Today, the walls remain intact, a broad pedestrian and cyclist promenade encircling a truly beautiful city. Lucca boasts gorgeous cathedrals, offices, museums and the suspiciously amphitheatre-shaped Piazza dell’Anfiteatro, built around a Roman amphitheatre.

Outside our hotel is a large, bronze statue of a moustachioed-man lounging cross-legged in a chair, smoking and looking bored. This is Giacomo Puccini (1858-1924), born in Lucca to become the greatest Italian opera composer after Verdi.

I don’t know if that “after Verdi” bit refers to Giuseppe Verdi’s chronologically first appearance in Italy (1813-1901), or to his being a better opera composer than Puccini. I have no way of judging the quality of opera music, which sounds to me like a whole lot of hollering and dramatic shrieking held together with pretty arias, the acoustic equivalent of duct tape. I only know two things about going to the opera: first, you are supposed to wear pants; and second, you must shout, “Thar she blows!” when the soprano lets fly in Act I.

What’s opera, doc?

The Italian word for opera turns out to be opera, which means “work” in the sense of the labour done (the mental and physical exertion), the result produced (This opera is my greatest achievement!) and the effort required to sit there and listen to it (I need a drink!).

No, opera is not for everybody. Most people typing these words right now (me) recognize opera as great music, but that doesn’t mean they (me) necessarily like it.

There are a few good reasons for people’s reluctance to embrace this form of classical combat theatre:

1. Opera does not come cheap.

2. Opera does not come short.

3. While it is true that opera finishes when the fat lady sings, it also begins that way, and is that way in the middle, too.

The good people of Lucca might have fixed those issues (well, two out of three ain’t bad). Every night of the year — for more than 40 years — a short evening concert is offered in the Chiesa e Battistero dei SS Giovanni e Reparata, a magnificent decommissioned church originally built in the 12th century.

It features a hauntingly beautiful interior with very hard chairs, all the better to keep you from falling asleep and taking a grievous elbow to the ribs from certain other audience members, by which I mean my wife.

The concert, which is different every night of the year, only lasts an hour, and only costs 25 euros. On the night we attended, the set list contained an enjoyable mix of arias by both Puccini and Verdi, and for the life of me, I can’t tell you which guy is better.

Who cares? Sitting in that beautiful Renaissance church, listening to talented musicians play and sing, I admit opera doesn’t seem like work at all.

Next week: Our tour winds down by winding up the many stairs of a certain wobbly tower, and then it’s many, many more stairs in beautiful Cinque Terre.
