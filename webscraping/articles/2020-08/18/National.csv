Dale Hawerchuk, a hockey phenom who became the face of the Winnipeg Jets en route to the Hall of Fame, has died at the age of 57 after a battle with stomach cancer.

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League’s Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

“After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,” Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal’s three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first over all by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

“A low-maintenance superstar,” said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg’s senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At 5 foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn’t blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack for getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

“Dale Hawerchuk put Winnipeg and the Jets on the map the day he arrived in our city in 1981, and his love for our community and Hall of Fame career will keep it there for many generations to come,” the Jets said in a statement. “Dale had a relationship with our fans unlike any player in the history of our franchise.

“Whether at home or on the world stage, ‘Ducky’ was embraced by so many, so often because of his humility and the grace by which he always carried himself.”

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: “All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL’s all time greatest players.”

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

“What an incredible human being,” Selanne tweeted.

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk “one of the most decorated players in our game’s history.”

In September, 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

“For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I’m ready to fight it,” he told TSN in October, 2019. “I want to live to tell the story.”

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie’s bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames defenceman Rasmus Andersson, a former Colt, paid tribute to Hawerchuk hours before his team’s playoff game against the Dallas Stars in Edmonton.

“Rest In Peace Dale, was an honour to play for you,” Andersson said.

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday’s opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at the age of 2 and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur’s record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

“I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive – well maybe a little further now with the traffic,” he said. “I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.”

“I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,” he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth over all by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and ’81 with teammates who included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL’s top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt as if he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year – the youngest recipient at the time – and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

Story continues below advertisement

“He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,” said Mike Doran, Winnipeg’s director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the face-off in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux’s famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

“It turned out fantastic,” said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada’s call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets “are etched in my mind every day that I live.”

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes’ ring of honour.

Hawerchuk rewrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia, which he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

“It’s like going back down memory lane,” he said in his induction speech.

“All the experiences have been fantastic,” he added. “I mean, sometimes they didn’t feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn’t change a thing. ... Even though I didn’t win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn’t change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.”

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets’ Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November, 2017.

“Tonight we fly Ducky’s number high,” said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue’s Home Sweet Home, before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

“Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,” the PA announcer said.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

“I’ve been to every part of [Manitoba], either golfing or playing [softball],” Hawerchuk said. “I’ve gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I’m honoured and I’m very humbled.”

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie."

What the Toronto Raptors did to the Brooklyn Nets on Monday was not garden-variety domination. This was something crueller.

The Raptors toyed with the Nets, getting them off their feet and down on the ground at the first bell. This wasn’t punching-bag stuff. This was like watching a guy work a speed bag. At one point, Toronto was up by 33 points.

When it got near the break, the Raptors laid off for a bit. They splashed some water on Brooklyn’s face. Lit them a cigarette. The Nets briefly regained consciousness.

Story continues below advertisement

Then when it got “close” Toronto resumed the pummelling. It finished 134-110.

The Raptors are here on their defensive reputation, and they have just posted a franchise-record for points scored in a playoff game.

By the end, the Nets had to make an emergency transition to their “B” team (which is every other playoff qualifier’s “C” team). It had suddenly dawned on the Brooklyn players that they will face this punishment again on Wednesday afternoon.

After it was over, the Raptors dealt the cruellest blow of all – they were nice about it.

“Those guys, the Nets, they played extremely hard. That was a battle,” Kyle Lowry said.

A battle? There have been more even-sided sneak attacks. If that’s a battle, I’d hate to be the guy who has to clean up after a romp.

“I knew they were capable,” head coach Nick Nurse said. “It didn’t totally surprise me they got going for a stretch.”

Story continues below advertisement

For a stretch.

Maybe Brooklyn can use quotes like that as motivation. To give up. This may be the first seven-game series in NBA history that lasts three games.

This is not exactly Brooklyn’s fault. It is a young, inexperienced team and all of its best players decided to turn an injury season off into a COVID-19 year off. Functionally, the Raptors are playing a G-League team.

But this much separation in terms of quality is not playoff basketball. It’s mercy-rule basketball.

What occurred to you in watching this is that, for the first time ever, this year’s Raptors are not just good. They are imperious. They lord it over other people.

The Kawhi-era Raptors were not that sort of club. They were resilient, but they didn’t dominate anyone. They dumped their first game of the 2019 postseason campaign to Orlando. Then they let Philadelphia beat them up. They lost the first two to Milwaukee. And they closed it out with a slapping contest against Golden State that would most likely have ended differently if Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson hadn’t both blown a tire.

Story continues below advertisement

That championship was a victory of the will. That doesn’t lessen it in the least. Rather, it ennobles it.

But there was no point during that run when you thought, “These guys have it in the bag.”

This year’s first game presages a very different sort of team. One that enjoys mind games. One that doesn’t care that you haven’t been here before and that that’s a little scary for you. They are going to biff you around like a red-headed stepchild until you have the good sense to run away. This Raptors team – easily the most likeable in recent history – is also the meanest.

Going into this, the Nets appeared to genuinely believe they had a puncher’s chance. They have been a lot of fun to watch in the bubble. Guard Caris LeVert had become something of a discovery.

When teams backed up in front of them, the fresh-legged Nets had fun running at them. But the seeding games aren’t the postseason. Nobody’s backing up any more.

“We know they’re the defending champs,” LeVert said a day ago. “But we’re going in there knowing that we like our chances against anybody, really.”

Story continues below advertisement

That second sentence now makes more sense if you change the punctuation from a period to three or four consecutive question marks. Because, really???

This is where you say something like, “It’s too soon to look ahead to …”

It’s not too soon. The Raptors should assign every coach but Nurse to scout the Philadelphia/Boston series. They don’t need them here.

This in the end may be the only drawback for the Raptors. That 3 vs. 6 Eastern Conference headliner could turn into a seven-game war. Which may very well leave the Raptors cooling their heels for most of a week. It might be in their interest to lay down for a game to Brooklyn, and draw out this torture for a while.

But it is clear this Toronto team is in a hellacious groove. There were some concerns coming in that offensive focal point Pascal Siakam had not rediscovered regular regular-season form. On Monday, he scored 18 points and was dive-bombing the rim like a spitfire. He’s fine.

Fred VanVleet is technically the other point guard. He scored 30 on 8-for-10 three-point shooting. At a certain point, in order to keep himself interested, Lowry appeared to devote himself entirely to drawing charges. The man, who never looks like he’s having fun out there, was very clearly having fun out there.

Story continues below advertisement

Man by man, the Raptors looked preposterously strong, while also breezy and at ease. It’s a rare combo.

The doubts about them will continue until they have eliminated a team of estimation. Giving the Nets a two-and-a-half-hour noogie for four days in a row isn’t going to change any minds. Nor you would imagine is beating either of Boston or Philadelphia.

The Raptors will not have a true reckoning until they meet Milwaukee. That’s a month from now. That’s a long time to stay mean. That’s going to be the real challenge.

Is talking this way tempting fate? Sure, it is. But some teams can do that and get away with it. It’s only one game, but however long you have been watching the Raptors, you have never seen them come out of the gate looking more like that sort of team."

For the second year in a row, the Calgary Flames have gotten exceptional goaltending in the postseason. As in 2019, it still may not be enough for them to advance to the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs.

Calgary’s high-flying offence remained grounded on Tuesday night in a 2-1 loss to the Dallas Stars, and now the Albertans face an elimination game two days hence. The loss came after a heartbreaking defeat in overtime on Sunday, and the Flames now trail in the best-of-seven series 3-2.

After having the second-best record in the NHL in 2018-19, they were eliminated in five games by the Colorado Avalanche. Calgary’s goalie in that series, Mike Smith, was by far the team’s best player but he didn’t get much help from anyone else.

The same is true of Cam Talbot, who turned away 30 of 32 shots in another tight game. He has faced 30 or more in four of the five games, and was deluged with 62 on Sunday.

John Klingberg, the Stars defenceman, scored the winning goal on a long wrist shot 72 seconds into the third period. Anton Khudobin had 28 saves in the win for Dallas. The game ended with Talbot on the bench and Calgary on a two-man advantage for the final 21 seconds.

Flames coach Geoff Ward felt that his players had the jitters at the start for the first time in this series. They gave up a shorthanded goal by Jamie Benn midway through the first period and were pinned in their end and outshot 14-7 over the first 20 minutes.

“Our team has not been in a 2-2 situation going into a Game 5 yet,” Ward said. “We don’t have many players with more than 20 games of playoff experience. When you know that the team that loses is going to be going into an elimination game, it’s tough to handle.

“It’s the first time I have seen us have a case of the nerves and it is understandable.”

Calgary didn’t get any production out of its first line, which went silent in last year’s defeat by Colorado. That series was a romp; this one has been tightly played but the Flames are still on the wrong end.

“We didn’t have the fight last year that this team has,” Ward said. “This team is going to battle back. I know comparison’s will be made, but to me these are two totally different situations.

The Flames were 12 seconds from taking a 3-1 series lead on Sunday when they surrendered the tying goal and then gave up the winner late in the first extra period. They were badly outshot and were similarly outplayed again at the start on Tuesday.

By the time Benn put Dallas ahead 1-0 midway through the first period, the Stars had already outshot Calgary, 9-2. Benn’s goal came from in close off a crisp cross-ice pass from Tyler Seguin.

The Flames coughed up the puck to the Stars’ tenacious defence 12 times in the first 20 minutes.

Despite being outplayed, Calgary went into the intermission tied at 1-1 behind a hard wrist shot from Mikael Backlund that beat Khudobin with just 46 seconds left in the period.

Talbot, who made 57 saves on Sunday and faced 159 shots in the first four games of the series, was sharp again. He stopped 13 of Dallas’ 14 shots in the first 20 minutes.

Before the game started, a ceremony was held to honour Dale Hawerchuk, whose family announced on Tuesday that he had died from stomach cancer. The 57-year-old member of the Hockey Hall of Fame scored 100 points six times and is best associated with his tenure with the Winnipeg Jets.

Dallas coach Rick Bowness, who coached Hawerchuk in Winnipeg during the 1980s, was visibly moved by the presentation. The Flames’ Rasmus Andersson and Andrew Mangiapane, both of whom played for Hawerchuk in the Ontario Hockey League, expressed regrets about his death after the game.

“Dale was just a great man,” Mangiapane said. “I don’t know where I would be without him. This was very sad news today.”

Calgary was much better in the second period, but Talbot still had to make a handful of brilliant stops to keep the score tied. After another giveaway, he denied Benn on a wrist shot from 25 feet away seven minutes into the period. He stopped Benn again and Corey Perry twice on dangerous chances during a flurry of shots in the last eight minutes of the period.

The Flames’ best chance came on a wraparound attempt by Sam Bennett that was knocked away by Khudobin less than two minutes before the second intermission.

Klingberg put the Stars up at the start of the third period and they simply held on for dear life the rest of the way. Calgary put tremendous pressure on Dallas late in the game but could never score the equalizer.

“I still think we have more than what we have showed here,” Mangiapane said.

Milan Lucic, the veteran forward, said the Flames were too passive at the start.

“The lesson there is that we have to be ready at the get-go,” Lucic said. “Right now, frustration is a waste of emotion. We have to look at what we can do to give us our best chance to win on Thursday.”

The Flames have played better than last year, but find themselves in a tough spot again.

“It’s time for us to come back and win a series when we are down,” Backlund said. “It is time for us to show we can have success in the playoffs.”"

It will forever be one of the iconic images of last year’s NBA championship run – Fred VanVleet on his back, arms outstretched, with his eyes looking up at the Oracle Arena ceiling while blood streamed from a gash under his eye.

It was nothing new to Anthony (Doc) Cornell.

VanVleet played for Cornell’s AAU team Pryme Time in his hometown of Rockford, Ill., and the coach said even as a seventh grader the Toronto Raptors guard had nerves of steel.

Story continues below advertisement

There was the tournament, Cornell recalled, where VanVleet reached in for a steal and took a headbutt to the eye.

“His eye literally is swollen shut, he looks like Rocky,” Cornell said. “So the physician at the tournament was like ‘Doc, this boy can’t play, he’s gotta go get stitches.’

“Fred looked at me and said ‘I’m playing.’ The doctor was like ‘Fred, you can’t see.’ Not only does Fred play, he leads us in scoring and assists with one eye in the championship game. People were like, ‘Man, Fred has one eye, and he’s killing y’all,’” Cornell said with a loud laugh.

“Those type of moments were always like ‘man, he’s just on a different level.’”

The undrafted star out of Wichita State was cut under the eye and chipped a front tooth in Game 4 of the Finals against Golden State. His battered face lent another layer to the already rich story when he poured in 22 points, including a huge three-pointer, late in the Raptors’ title-clinching Game 6 win over the Warriors.

The 26-year-old has picked up where he left off last postseason, erupting for 30 points in Monday’s Game 1 win over Brooklyn in the opening round of the playoffs in Florida. VanVleet knocked down eight three-pointers and assisted on another seven.

On one late three-pointer, VanVleet pulled up to leave his defender, skidding by him like a puppy on linoleum.

Story continues below advertisement

VanVleet said he’s been working on shooting from longer distances, sparked by conversations with coach Nick Nurse during last year’s playoffs. The six-foot guard was getting blocked too often, and the Raptors needed him scoring.

“So I started putting it in my game and I’ve just been working on it more and more since then,” VanVleet said Tuesday. “Obviously with the playoffs, it’s a little bit harder to get your shot off, and guys are flying around a little bit more. If you can knock it down from distance, it just makes it that much harder for the defence to run out to you. Sometimes you catch ‘em off guard or you just avoid that extra couple inches of hand to contest.”

Mr. Bet on Yourself has always loved a good challenge.

Cornell’s Pryme Time roster, which VanVleet helped transform into the most successful in Rockford AAU history, was unconventional. Where other AAU teams would load up with four or five bigs, Cornell preferred guards and shooters. They were the smaller team in any game. They usually played up an age group, often against powerhouse teams boasting shoe deals.

Other teams tried to woo him away.

“But he was always loyal, he’d say ‘Why would I leave? I’m the captain of the ship. These are my soldiers. I’m staying with my group,’” Cornell said. “As it turned out, he was the type of floor general and leader to help us get past all these bigger, higher-ranked so-called AAU giants.”

Cornell has loads of stories of VanVleet’s heroics from the five years he played for Pryme Time.

There was a memorable Friday night game of a major AAU tournament. Pryme Time, which was short-handed, needed to beat the Wisconsin state champions to get to the bracket round. With about 10 seconds left, one of VanVleet’s teammates tried to set a pick to get him the ball.

“Fred yells ‘give me the damn ball!’ then Fred takes one dribble from outside the three-point line and shoots it right down the middle,” Cornell said. “Nothing beyond net. Walks off and says, ‘I told you we wasn’t going home.’”

“I think I was 10 times more excited than him, I got on the phone and called his mom, I said ‘Sue, I know people say this all the time about different players, but this boy is going to the league.’ I said, ‘You should have seen what he just did. He shot it like ice water in his veins, like it was nothing.’”

VanVleet was the kid who only needed a foot in the door, Cornell said.

“His mindset going to tournaments was his bag was his briefcase, and this was a business trip to get him to where he intended to go in the future,” the coach said.

VanVleet committed to Wichita State ahead of his Grade 12 year, so Shockers coach Gregg Marshall caught most of his final two AAU seasons.

“Pryme Time was this little team out of Rockford, just a bunch of dudes, a ragtag group. But they were beating all of the great shoe-company, elite AAU programs and Fred was just orchestrating the whole thing,” Marshall said. “I’m sitting there going, ‘wow.’ I mean, he’s literally taking this group and winning.”

He did the same thing at Wichita State, taking the Shockers to the Final Four in 2013.

“No matter what the stage, he believes he’s put in the work, and he’s got the mindset and the calmness, and he’s precocious if you will,” Marshall said. “And he just seems to will his team to be … the sum is better than the individual parts, right?”

VanVleet was just a freshman when he led the Shockers to an upset of Gonzaga at the 2013 NCAA tournament. With a little less than two minutes to play, Wichita was up by a couple of points, and VanVleet fumbled the ball toward his team’s bench. He managed to retrieve it but not in time to fully turn to face the net.

“He didn’t hesitate, he just shot it, and as a freshman, to take a shot like that,” the coach marvelled. “And as it was going through the net, he just looked at me like, ‘Oh, that was good the whole way’ and gave me this little shrug.

“It reminded me so much of some shots that he hit in the clinching game for the title last year.”

VanVleet, who’s earning just more than US$9-million this season, will be a hot commodity in free agency come October, and re-signing him should be a top priority for Toronto.

Rockford Mayor Tom McNamara said he believes there’s no putting a pricetag on VanVleet’s efforts off the court as well, and the guard’s commitment to his hometown.

“Kind of weird to say about someone with such star power as Fred, but he’s a better person off the court than he is a basketball player on the court,” said the 37-year-old McNamara, whose dad, John, was Rockford’s mayor in the 1980s.

The city of 150,000 is infamous for being listed among the most dangerous cities in the United States in past years, with a violent crime rate ranking worse than nearby Chicago.

VanVleet’s roots there still run deep. He sells his “Bet on Yourself” sportswear line out of his downtown shop. The city held viewing parties – “our own mini-Jurassic Parks,” McNamara said – during last year’s Raptors playoff run. He was presented with a key to the city. McNamara joked the city’s nickname would forever be “Fredford.”

“He’s made a lifelong Bulls fan into a Raptors fan,” McNamara said.

VanVleet organizes annual backpack giveaways for Rockford kids. He posted a message to Rockfordians at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic urging them to stay safe. When McNamara implemented the Mayor’s Office on Domestic Violence and Human Trafficking Prevention, he reached out to VanVleet for support.

“Obviously with his schedule, he can’t go into every high school with me. But he did videos for us. I’ve never once called and asked him for anything where he’s said no to, that benefits the community,” McNamara said.

VanVleet’s father – also named Fred – was shot to death in 1999 in what’s been reported as a drug deal that went bad. VanVleet was 5 at the time, and was raised by his mom Sue and stepfather Joe Danforth, a police officer who introduced him to basketball at a young age to steer him away from trouble.

Kids in Rockford look up to VanVleet, McNamara said, but the appreciation goes beyond what he’s able to do on the court.

“It’s different with Fred, it’s different because he is just such a class act. He is quietly, steadily showing how to just be a good human, not just an exceptional basketball player but someone who cares, and doesn’t forget about where he came from,” he said.

His story of perseverance, McNamara said, mirrors so many people of Rockford.

“He’s kind of the model of what we would call ‘the Rockford grit and toughness,’” the mayor said. “A lot of wonderful people just working exceptionally hard to excel.”"

The Associated Press

It’s been six years since the Raptors reimagined what sports culture could be in Toronto.

Up until April, 2014, the local rooting tradition was based in quiet misery. The teams were awful. The players were anonymous. The fans were distinguished by their hopeless resilience. There was a shabby nobility in being able to bear so much mediocrity.

Then the Raptors played the Brooklyn Nets.

Story continues below advertisement

The magical moment in that series was first-year general manager Masai Ujiri’s Game 1 pep rally. Ujiri workshopped a last-minute addition with his lieutenants, got up on the podium at the fan site and baited the opposition with a geo-sexual impossibility.

The Nets were staffed by NBA old-money types such as Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett. They had NYC pedigree, bold-face owners and still had a bit of that new-car smell.

The Raptors were a bunch of losers who’d spent a lot of that season trying (and failing) to tank. The most famous story people told about that team was how their ostensible star, Rudy Gay, banned the distribution of stats sheets to players in the postgame locker room. He didn’t like being confronted in print by all the shots he’d missed.

With Gay gone, the Raptors were a team of nobodies led by a guy whose biggest accomplishment was trading Carmelo Anthony.

But the Raptors were the ones making threats. The first time you saw Ujiri in the midst of his profane outburst, you probably felt a thrill. It was knowing that for the first time in your life, you got to root for the villains.

Garnett tried shooting back – “I don’t know if you can say, ‘Eff Brooklyn’ and then come into Brooklyn.” To which Raptors assistant coach Jamaal Magloire responded with cannon fire – “He’s a talker who can’t back it up. And you can print that.”

When it got to the point where the Nets felt they had to respond to tabloid front pages (“Raptors vs. Dinosaurs”), you knew they’d lost the plot. Somehow, Brooklyn and Toronto had traded imaginary cities.

The Raptors didn’t win that series, but the team had already changed the civic tone.

You can trace a straight line between Ujiri’s new brand of boldness and then-Blue Jays GM Alex Anthopoulos’s decision to go all-in on trades the next summer. Ujiri also created the environment in which it was possible for the Maple Leafs to give up and start over.

Ujiri gave Toronto permission to be its authentic self. Wisely, Toronto decided to be someone cooler and began importing talent.

All those moments – Brooklyn/Raptors, Leafs teardown, the Bat Flip, Auston Matthews picked No. 1, the NBA title – are connected.

What connects them isn’t winning. That’s a small part of it. The current that runs underneath all those moments – every one of which was remarkable, if not always successful – is outsiderism.

“Eff Brooklyn” finally informed foreign athletes working in this country what Canadians wanted from them. They wanted them to absorb the national tendency toward feeling unrecognized and underappreciated. They wanted to feel chosen by people of estimation. They wanted something benign and largely meaningless to fight against.

In the United States, people signal their displeasure by tearing down institutions that keep the body politic together. Up here, we take a longer view. If we’re annoyed, we yell about things that don’t matter. It’s working so far.

For instance, the scheduling of this year’s NBA playoffs.

The NBA postseason starts Monday. Working off the tipoff times, the defending champion Toronto Raptors are the least interesting team in it.

The Raptors play the Nets on Monday at 4 p.m. ET, on Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. and again on Friday at 1:30 p.m.

That works really well for me because a) deadlines and b) watching sports for a living is not a real job, so if they schedule the games at 4 a.m. I just have to remember to stop drinking before dinner.

But I am going to presume that you have responsibilities that preclude you from taking a three-hour basketball break in the middle of the day.

Story continues below advertisement

Now on the one hand, this makes sense. The Nets aren’t any good. The Raptors will beat the snot out of them. The Eastern Conference series getting the evening slot – Boston/Philadelphia – is tighter on paper and therefore more interesting.

But you cannot be properly Toronto if you are not complaining about being ignored. More reliably than winning games, this sense of grievance is what juices local fans.

No Toronto-based athlete has understood that better than Kyle Lowry. Fred VanVleet has been taking pointers.

(If the Leafs’ current stars want to understand anything about how to talk to their customers, they should spend the next two months living inside the Raptors’ bubble.)

Now that the Raptors are champions, they don’t need to vocalize their complaints. It’s a tone of voice or a tilt of the head – “Yeah, they hate us. You know it and I know it. The only people we can trust are ourselves.”

To hear Toronto tell it, Toronto is badly underestimated (truth: its Vegas odds to win just shot up to 9 to 1).

Story continues below advertisement

Nobody likes the Raptors (truth: the team is the Sonic Youth of every U.S.-based NBA writer – the indie band they like to think no one else has ever heard of).

They don’t care what you think of them (actually, that part is probably true).

At this point, winning is no longer the issue for the Raptors. They proved they could.

They are the team that doesn’t want your approval, never mind need it. They have reached a sort of basketball nirvana. No noise can penetrate their self-contained world. At least, none has yet.

Just before this story flips back into the dreary world of wins and losses, it’s fun to reflect on how much this one team – a born loser for almost the entirety of its existence – has changed the conversation.

The Raptors have done something greater than win. Lots of teams win. But only a very few have ascended from a sports franchise to a state of mind."

Pablo Piatti opened his Major League Soccer scoring account with a 25-foot rocket, then added another in the second half as Toronto FC handily defeated the Vancouver Whitecaps 3-0 on Tuesday.

Piatti, playing his first game at BMO Field, made his presence known all night, giving the Vancouver (2-4-0) defence fits as Toronto (3-0-3) kept the Whitecaps hemmed in their own end for most of the game.

The Argentine midfielder opened the scoring in the 27th minute as he hammered the ball into the top left corner of the Whitecaps goal, leaving goalkeeper Thomas Hasal with no chance.

Piatti made it 2-0 in the 55th minute after getting a nice feed in the box from Jonathan Osorio and cooly sending the ball past Hasal.

Nick DeLeon put the game out of reach in the 83rd minute when he converted a nice pass from Alejandro Pozuelo.

Tuesday’s contest was the first of nine games between the three Canadian MLS teams. TFC, the Whitecaps and the Montreal Impact are staying in Canada for this phase of the season because of border restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Results during the all-Canadian stretch count in the MLS regular-season standings, and the top team through the nine games earns a spot in the Canadian Championship final.

TFC and the Whitecaps will face off again Friday at BMO Field.

Tuesday’s match was the first MLS game in Canada since March 7, when TFC beat New York City FC 1-0 in front of a crowd of 26,171.

Stands normally filled with raucous fans, chanting and stamping their feet to create a daunting atmosphere for opposing teams, sat empty due to COVID-19 safety measures. The Toronto FC starting lineup was belted out over the BMO sound system, each name being met with silence.

But the club’s most ardent supporters, normally found in BMO Field’s animated south end, did their best to inject some energy into the atmosphere. A number of fans congregated across the road from the north end of the stadium, chanting, waving flags, banging drums and lighting flares from the opening kickoff to the final whistle.

The Whitecaps were fortunate to come out of a Toronto-dominated first half down just a goal. Toronto had nine shots on goal (four on target) to Vancouver’s one, and the Reds had six corners, to just one for the Whitecaps.

Piatti had another chance in the 35th minute after a nice set up from Pozuelo, but his shot was deflected over the Whitecaps goal. Jozy Altidore, in the starting lineup for the first time since March 7, had a chance blocked a minute later.

The second half was more of the same, with Toronto continuing to press and Vancouver unable to muster an effective counterattack. Final shots were 24 (eight on target) for Toronto to four (one on target) for Vancouver.

Quentin Westberg picked up the clean sheet for Toronto. He didn’t have to deal with much, making saves. Defender Ali Adnan had one of Vancouver’s rare chances in the 73rd minute, but his shot sailed over the Toronto goal.

The Whitecaps, who impressed last month at the MLS is Back in Orlando by taking a depleted squad to the knockout stages, look disjointed all game despite having some key reinforcements in their lineup.

Forwards Lucas Cavallini, Fredy Montero and Tosaint Ricketts, along with defender Andy Rose and defender/midfielder Georges Mukumbilwa, did not make the trip to Orlando due to personal or medical reasons. Cavallini and Rose started on Tuesday, while Ricketts came on as a substitute in the 81st minute.

Among the supporters’ club flags that dotted the south stands was a large black-and-white banner that read “Love Football Hate Racism.” Players from both teams knelt before the game, some with a raised fist."

Forty “social-distance ambassadors” will monitor the US Open grounds to make sure players and others are avoiding close contact and wearing face coverings — the U.S. Tennis Association bought 500,000 masks to distribute — as part of efforts to avoid a coronavirus outbreak during the fan-free Grand Slam tournament.

“We’re trying to leave nothing to chance,” Billie Jean King National Tennis Center chief operating officer Danny Zausner said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press, “and make it as stress-free for the players as possible.”

The USTA announced Tuesday that one person, who is not a player, turned up positive for COVID-19 out of 1,400 tests administered in the controlled environment set up for the US Open and another tennis tournament preceding it at the same site in New York.

The Western & Southern Open, moved this year from Cincinnati because of the pandemic, begins Saturday. The US Open starts Aug. 31.

Two tests are taken 48 hours apart when a player or member of an entourage arrives at one of the two official hotels or one of the private homes the USTA made available for rent on Long Island. (Eight players chose the private housing option.)

The person, who is asymptomatic, came up positive on the second test and will be isolated for 10 days. Contact tracing will attempt to determine who might have been exposed.

“We expected this to happen,” USTA chief executive Mike Dowse said during a conference call with reporters. “Mathematically, we expected to have a positive, if not more than one. So we did anticipate this and we have put very specific protocol in place to prevent this from spreading broadly. … Our No. 1 priority is to take care of this person first, and secondly to prevent the spread from going any further.”

Once the US Open begins, a player testing positive would be kicked out of the tournament.

“This is all about mitigation of risk, lessening the exposure,” tournament director Stacey Allaster said.

She said about 350 players — roughly 90 per cent of the field — already are in the “bubble.”

Story continues below advertisement

Among the elements of the USTA’s plan, described to the AP by Zausner:

Similar to the on-site ambassadors, who will be split into two shifts of 20, monitors at the hotels will make sure people don’t leave their rooms for 24 hours after an initial COVID-19 test. “If they come down for whatever reason — because they’re young — a security person is there to say, ‘Excuse me. You need to be upstairs,’ and send them back up to their room,” Zausner said.

Instead of individual cars ferrying players and others between the hotels and tournament site, about 60 buses will be used, filled to 50-per-cent capacity. One person will sit by each window and the adjacent seat will remain empty.

Every room on the 40-acre USTA campus was measured and had its air flow analyzed. Some rooms were shuttered, others outfitted with filtration systems to rotate air and “meet hospital criteria,” according to Zausner.

Arthur Ashe Stadium locker rooms that normally hold up to 300 people are limited to 30 at a time — and only players, not coaches or other entourage members. And players’ access will be restricted to 15 minutes or so, tied to match and practice schedules. “That’s a big sacrifice for [players]. They’re used to hanging out in the locker room, the lounges in the locker room, spending quality time in there with other players,” Zausner said. “And that just can’t happen under this scenario.”

Most training and massage tables were moved from locker rooms to outdoors, such as under the viewing gallery for practice courts.

The player dining room’s capacity was reduced from 300 to 50; hundreds of rented tables and chairs were set up on the Ashe promenade.

Sixty-four suites in the main arena, each of which normally generates hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual revenue, are being assigned as personal lounges to the 32 women and 32 men who are singles seeds for the US Open.

“For the players, this has to feel like a US Open — like, even better than last year’s US Open,” Zausner said. “The only caveat is that we’re building it for 350-plus players but not 800,000-plus fans.”"

“He’s not feeling right, and so that’s why he’s going to get it looked at,” coach Craig Berube said. “It’s concerning, but we don’t know a lot yet, so I’m not going to jump to conclusions on anything.”

The 28-year-old Russian winger missed the majority of the season after having his dislocated shoulder operated on in October. He returned to the ice for training camp but had zero points and 10 shots in goal in four games since the NHL restarted and clearly didn’t look like himself.

“For sure he wasn’t full out, but in saying that, I didn’t think there was anything wrong,” Berube said. “I understood why, coming back from surgery and nine months off. ... It’s not easy being off that long and coming back and just jumping right into it and being full out. I knew he’d come back and probably ease his way in a little bit.”

The defending Stanley Cup champions played the majority of the season without Tarasenko and were first in the Western Conference when the season was halted in March.

“The way we play, too, is pretty simple and everybody play for each other and we work hard,” said winger Jacob de la Rose, who took Tarasenko’s spot in the lineup. “Blues hockey is get pucks deep, play hard, play good defensively and that’s what we’ve been doing here and I feel like that’s what we did all year, too, during the regular season, so even if we lose guys, it’s easy for a guy like me here coming into the series, too. You know what they expect of you.”

Tarasenko had 11 goals and six assists during the Blues’ title run last year. He had 10 points in 10 games this season before being injured.

Berube isn’t worried about not having Tarasenko for at least the next two games.

“We’re a team,” he said. “We play without players at times because you have to with injuries and different situations that come up. Our team is what makes us a good team. We just rely on each other and different people can come in and take people’s spots and just do the job.”"

The recently retired Winnipeg Blue Bombers superfan was hoping to fill up his summer schedule with football games.

“All hell broke loose,” he said Tuesday.

He was disappointed to learn his team won’t be able to defend its Grey Cup championship this year. However, he’s not letting the CFL’s decision to scrap the season affect his unbroken streak – he is considering 2020 a lost year.

“It’s not my fault they aren’t playing this year, so I’m going to consider my streak alive,” he said. “If it was happening this year in Regina, I would be going.”

Fans across the league shared in the sadness of the lost year after commissioner Randy Ambrosie announced the decision to cancel the 2020 season and focus on 2021.

There was hope Winnipeg – home of the 2019 champions – could serve as a hub city for the league. But the CFL was unable to secure financing from the federal government or resolve some other issues.

It marks the first year the Grey Cup won’t be presented since 1919.

Fan Mike Goodchild had a lot more time for vacation and house projects this summer in Manitoba, but said he’d rather be watching football games.

“We miss going to the games, watching our favourite players,” Goodchild said Tuesday. “It is what it is right now.”

That the Bombers remain the reigning champions is a small silver lining to the news, Emile Morrissette said. The Manitoba team won its 11th CFL championship with a 33-12 victory against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats last November, ending a 29-year drought.

Morrissette, a season-ticket holder, wanted to see what the champions would have done to defend the title on the field.

“Finally we win the Grey Cup and we have a very competitive team and we are probably going into the season to be one of the favourites again and then that COVID hit,” Morrissette said.

“You know, it just makes it tough as a fan.”

Some people plan their summers around the cottage or the beach, but Morrissette and his sister make their plans around going to football games together.

He supports the decision if the league can become stronger and more financially stable for future seasons.

In Saskatchewan, Nelson Hackewich said he was expecting the season would be cancelled, but it was still hard to hear.

“The league was in a situation where it couldn’t win. It was going to lose money either way,” he said. “It still hurts that we aren’t going to have CFL football this year.”

To say the Hackewich family are Saskatchewan Roughriders fans is an understatement – they bleed green and white, he said. They are known for the Rider Room in his parents’ Regina house. They converted Hackewich’s childhood bedroom into a place to showcase decades of Roughriders memorabilia.

To fill the hole left by the season, Hackewich began simulating the CFL season using a video game and livestreaming it online. Each Friday, he gets about 8,000 viewers. But it’s not quite the same as watching the game, he said.

It also feels like a bit of salt in the wound for Hackewich that the season was cancelled the year the Roughriders’ top rivals – the Bombers – hold the Cup.

“They ended one of the longest droughts in CFL history and the league decided they were going to shut it down. ... It’s all Winnipeg’s fault,” Hackewich said with a friendly laugh.

Morrissette responded from Winnipeg that it better not be another curse on the Bombers.

Ligue 1′s opening match of the new season has been postponed from Friday night after Olympique de Marseille said they had confirmed four cases of COVID-19, French professional soccer’s governing body the LFP said on Tuesday.

“In view of medical results passed on by Olympique Marseille … the LFP has decided to postpone the Olympique de Marseille/AS Saint-Étienne game to Sept 16 or Sept 17,” the LFP said in statement.

The game was the only fixture set for Friday, with the rest of Ligue 1′s first round of 2020-21 matches spread out over Saturday and Sunday.

The LFP told clubs last week it had set up a “COVID committee” to advise on whether to postpone matches. When a club reports more than three coronavirus cases, postponement is likely, based on the “COVID protocol” the LFP sent out to the clubs.

Among the “Big Five” European soccer countries, France was the only one to end its season prematurely because of the pandemic. Paris Saint-Germain was awarded the Ligue 1 title.

The Parisian club and Olympique Lyonnais have reached the semi-finals of the reformatted Champions League, the first time that two French teams will compete at that level. Olympique Marseille is France’s only winner of the biggest prize in European football.

Almost 40 players from 11 Ligue 1 clubs out of 20 have tested positive for COVID-19, including some at Saint-Étienne.

Spain’s Mediapro, which holds the rights to air top Ligue 1 matches for the 2020-21 to 2023-24 seasons, agreed in early June with TF1, France’s biggest private TV operator, to form a new channel to air top Ligue 1 league matches in the country."

The St. Louis Blues battled-tested vets gave the Vancouver Canucks a lesson on playoff resiliency Monday, shutting down the Canuck power play and fixing their own to draw even in their NHL playoff series.

Ryan O’Reilly scored twice and added an assist for the Blues in a 3-1 win at Rogers Place to give them their second consecutive win and tie the best-of-seven series at two games each.

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

“It was nice to get on the board tonight,” said O’Reilly.

“I haven’t been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it’s just one game. I’ve got to be consistent with it.”

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

“When we take care of the puck it’s effective and it’s hard on them,” said O’Reilly.

“I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We’ve got to stick to our structure.”

Pietrangelo said they’ve been working on fixing the penalty kill.

“We’ve been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,” he said.

“Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.”

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

“They’re blocking a lot of shots, they’re studying us. They kind of know what we’re doing,” said Miller.

He said they’ll make adjustments but aren’t going to go back to square one.

“We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,” he said.

“It’s not like we’re getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They’re a good team. We’re a good team. It’s going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.”

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O’Reilly, last year’s Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play – the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O’Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O’Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler’s stick and in.

O’Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Story continues below advertisement

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

All Western Conference games are being played in front of no fans at Rogers Place. The players are being kept isolated in a so-called bubble between games to prevent contracting COVID-19."

Jake DeBrusk, Brad Marchand and the Boston Bruins quickly went from trailing by two goals to overwhelming the Carolina Hurricanes with a dominating third period.

DeBrusk scored twice while the Bruins scored four straight goals to rally and beat the Hurricanes 4-3 on Monday to take a 3-1 lead in their first-round playoff series.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

“We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,” Marchand said. “That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.”

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

“We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do – little battles,” Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour said. “They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.”

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President’s Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk’s first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy’s hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina’s captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy put away from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston’s first six post-season games.

“There’s other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,” Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. “But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.”

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen’s late goal.

“That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,” Williams said. “We got it handed to us.”

NOTES

David Pastrnak had a goal and an assist in Boston’s double-overtime win in Game 1, but hasn’t played since. He had 48 regular-season goals to tie Washington’s Alex Ovechkin for the league lead. Carolina played without 20-year-old Andrei Svechnikov, who was injured when his leg twisted awkwardly beneath him late in the third period of Saturday’s loss. ... DeBrusk scored his 12th and 13th playoff goals since his 2018 post-season debut. The Hurricanes were also without D Joel Edmundson for the third straight game. Jake Gardiner assisted on Williams’ first-period goal for his first post-season point with Carolina."

Joel Embiid led Philadelphia with 26 points and 16 rebounds, and Josh Richardson and Alec Burks each scored 18. The 76ers played without All-Star guard Ben Simmons (knee surgery).

Brown, who missed time in the third quarter with a right thigh contusion, tied the score at 86 on a 3-pointer with 8:34 to go in the fourth. He hit four free throws in a 3-second span for a 92-86 margin.

The Colorado Avalanche scored three early goals, revved up their power play and hit Arizona with a barrage of odd-man rushes.

Their defence closed in around goalie Philipp Grubauer, shut down the Coyotes’ shooting lanes.

Dominating in all aspects, the Avalanche are now within one win of advancing in the Stanley Cup playoffs.

Story continues below advertisement

Nazem Kadri had two goals and an assist, Philipp Grubauer stopped 14 shots and the Avalanche overwhelmed the Coyotes 7-1 Monday to take a 3-1 lead their first-round playoff series.

“We had a real good night tonight,” Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. “We had some real good individual efforts and guys capitalized on their chances.”

The Avalanche jumped on Arizona after losing 4-2 in Game 3, scoring three first-period goals, two by Kadri on the power play.

Matt Calvert, Cale Makar and Mikko Rantanen each had a goal and an assist. Matt Nieto and Joonas Donskoi also scored. Grubauer was sharp after Pavel Francouz started Game 3.

A complete all-around game in the Edmonton bubble puts Colorado, the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference, in position to clinch the series in Game 5 on Wednesday.

“We had so many chances in Game 3 and obviously couldn’t get the puck in the net,” said Colorado forward Nathan MacKinnon, who had two assists. “It was nice to see us get that early one and we just kept going from there.”

The Coyotes had numerous defensive breakdowns and took three penalties while falling into the early hole, leaving goalie Darcy Kuemper defenceless.

Story continues below advertisement

Kuemper gave up four goals on 22 shots before being replaced by Antti Raanta in the third period and Jakob Chychrun scored for the Coyotes, who were held to 15 shots.

Coming off a big win in Game 3, the Coyotes are now one game from having their playoff bubble popped.

“I can’t tell you one player who played well today. We were embarrassed,” Coyotes coach Rick Tocchet said. “It was men against boys today.”

Arizona played its rope-a-Yote style to near perfection to win Game 3, absorbing Colorado’s near-constant pressure and counterattacking when the opportunities arose.

Kuemper made it work, stopping 49 shots for the second time this post-season, and the Coyotes blocked 27 shots in front of him.

Arizona wanted to be more aggressive offensively, as it was in Game 2, but Colorado had the game’s first six shots and scored late in the first period when a Coyotes turnover led to an odd-man rush. Nieto scored it by angling his skate to knock the puck past Kuemper on a feed from Calvert.

Story continues below advertisement

Colorado kept up the pressure, leading to Arizona’s third penalty in the opening period. The Avalanche converted on the power play, going up 2-0 on Kadri’s rebound two minutes after Nieto’s goal.

Kadri scored again on a power play in the closing seconds of the first period, punching in a rebound after the Coyotes allowed MacKinnon an open rush at Kuemper.

“It’s not good enough to come out like that when it’s a 2-1 series,” Coyotes captain Oliver Ekman-Larsson said.

Donskoi made it 4-0 midway through the second period on another odd-man rush, one-timing a pass from Andre Burakovsky past Kuemper’s glove side.

Arizona finally showed some signs of offensive life, scoring its first power-play goal of the series on a wrist shot by Chychrun from the right circle.

Raanta, who had been out since Game 2 against Nashville, replaced Kuemper to start the third period and gave up a goal 19 seconds in. Makar, a Calder Trophy finalist, shook defenceman Alex Goligoski with a nifty move and beat Raanta stick side to make it 5-1.

“That was an amazing and what made it more amazing was how easy he made it look,” Nieto said.

The same thing could be said about Colorado’s entire roster in Game 4.

Notes

Colorado C Vladislav Namestnikov missed his second straight game after leaving Game 2 in the second period. ... Arizona leading scorer Nick Schmaltz missed his eighth straight game since suffering a head injury in an exhibition game. ... MacKinnon has a least a point in all seven post-season games (two goals, seven assists). ... Conor Garland, Arizona’s leading goal scorer during the regular season, was injured in the first and did not play the final two periods."

“I’m heartsick for our players,” Randy Ambrosie told reporters. The league’s board of governors made the cancellation decision Monday morning, after learning late Friday that the Liberal government had denied its request for a $30-million interest-free loan.

The league, which was originally scheduled to kick off its 2020 campaign in early June before the coronavirus hit, had drawn up a hub-city plan under which it would gather all nine CFL teams in Winnipeg this fall. Each team would play a six-game regular season, with no fans in stands at the Blue Bombers’ IG Field, with the top eight advancing to three weeks of playoffs. The league would have staged a total of 34 games, including the Grey Cup.

The cancellation means this will be the first year since 1919 that the Grey Cup will not be awarded.

The hub-city plan was itself a change of strategy from the spring, when Ambrosie all but ruled out playing games without fans.

On Monday, he said that, in retrospect, “there are things I would have liked to have done differently,” adding that he does feel “responsible for the fact that we are not on the field this year.”

In late April, Ambrosie came under fire from politicians, fans and even the CFL’s own players’ union for requesting a federal bailout of up to $150-million. The league later modified and then revoked that request, but it continued to seek federal help.

Last month, the league was reportedly in talks with a pair of government agencies, including the Business Development Bank of Canada, for a loan of up to $44-million, but the commercial terms it had been offered were too onerous to accept.

During an appearance in front of a parliamentary finance committee in May, Ambrosie said CFL teams collectively “lose between $10-million and $20-million a season.” He added that if the season were scrapped and the teams were forced to give back season-ticket deposits and refund money they had received for TV rights, “our financial crisis will become very real and very big.”

More than most big sports leagues, which earn the bulk of their revenue from high-priced TV contracts, the CFL’s business model leans heavily on the sale of game tickets. In 2018, the last year for which figures are available, gate receipts and other game-day revenue accounted for 55.7 per cent of income for the Edmonton football team. TV revenue made up less than 17 per cent of the team’s revenue.

Ambrosie said that it had been “frustrating” to see other leagues, such as the NHL, NBA and even Canadian Premier League soccer pivot to fan-less games. “The big leagues, the financial resources they had at their disposal to throw at a hub [city plan], as they have, we don’t have.”

While the CFL projected that a truncated season staged without fans in stands would still lose tens of millions of dollars, an entirely scuttled season could lose more.

It also hoped this fall could give it a rare, relatively unobstructed access to Canadian sports fans during a year of chaos. “We did see a real opportunity, particularly in that October-November window, to really kind of dominate the landscape, where the NHL season would end and the NBA season would end, and we would really have some space to tell our story,” Ambrosie said.

The league hoped it could “really put our football on display and really take centre stage in Canada. We felt very, very good about that.”

Instead, Ambrosie said, the league will lick its wounds and take the opportunity of the extra few months it now has to work on “operational efficiency” to improve its financial framework.

Ambrosie also told reporters the league planned to court a broader fan base, using “this time to reach into communities of newer Canadians we have not had the opportunity to tell how amazing it is to sit in a CFL stadium and cheer on your local team, how much you’ll feel more Canadian when you do these things, using our stadiums to celebrate being Canadian, using our stadiums to celebrate our diversity.”

The executive director of the CFL Players’ Association said that while the cancellation was “devastating” for the athletes and the families, the pandemic had highlighted some of the structural weaknesses in the league’s operations. “We have an opportunity now to fix this, moving forward, including the relationship between the players and the league,” said Brian Ramsay, in an interview on Monday.

The players are not expected to be paid any of their 2020 salaries. The league is scheduled to meet with the players’ association on Tuesday to discuss helping them access the federal Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy program."

Angela Buxton, a British tennis player who was the doubles partner of Althea Gibson when the American became the first Black person to win a major title in 1956, has died. She was 85.

The International Tennis Federation announced the death of Buxton on Monday, describing her as “an early pioneer of equal rights.”

World No. 2 Simona Halep of Romania will not travel to New York to play in the US Open because of COVID-19 concerns, she said on Monday, leaving the women’s draw at the Grand Slam tournament without six of the world’s top-10 players.

Halep joined world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty, defending champion Bianca Andreescu, Elina Svitolina, Kiki Bertens and Belinda Bencic in skipping the event at Flushing Meadows.

“After weighing up all the factors involved and with the exceptional circumstances in which we are living, I have decided that I will not travel to New York to play the U.S. Open,” Halep, the reigning Wimbledon champion, wrote on Twitter.

“I always said I would put my health at the heart of my decision and I therefore prefer to stay and train in Europe. I know the USTA and WTA have worked tirelessly to put on a safe event and I wish everyone there a successful tournament.”

Halep, 28, won the Prague Open over the weekend – her first event since COVID-19 pandemic shut down tennis in March – and said she would announce her decision about playing in the US Open on Monday.

The United States has become the world’s biggest hot spot for the novel coronavirus, recording more than 5.4 million cases and more than 170,000 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.

The US Open, due to start on Aug. 31, will be played behind closed doors and Halep’s absence is another blow to organizers after a spate of withdrawals.

World No. 2 and defending men’s champion Rafael Nadal decided to skip the tournament, while five-time winner Roger Federer is taking the rest of the year off to recover from knee surgery.

The Montreal Canadiens didn’t play poorly Sunday.

Carter Hart just played better – and got some help from his friends.

The Philadelphia goalie made 23 saves to record the first playoff shutout of his career as the Flyers defeated the Canadiens 1-0 to take a 2-1 lead in their opening-round series.

Montreal, which chased Hart from Friday’s emphatic 5-0 victory with four goals on 26 shots, hit two crossbars and three posts in a grinding, low-event encounter.

“That was style of game we expected,” Canadiens winger Brendan Gallagher said. “They find a way to put one in our net and we were unable to beat their goaltender.

“You give up one goal, you should be able to win.”

Jakub Voracek scored for Philadelphia, the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference as part of the NHL’s restart to its pandemic-hit season.

“It was a greasy hockey game,” Flyers head coach Alain Vigneault said. “Both teams worked extremely hard. It was hard to make offensive plays. Both teams were not giving a lot of room.”

Carey Price stopped 19 shots to take the loss for Montreal inside an empty Scotiabank Arena.

Game 4 of the best-of-seven matchup goes Tuesday afternoon.

After the Flyers opened the scoring early in the first period, Montreal centre Jesperi Kotkaniemi hit the crossbar 30 seconds into the third – the fifth time the Canadiens found iron in just over 40 minutes.

Hart then took an Artturi Lehkonen shot off the mask on a short-handed 2-on-1 with under eight minutes to go in regulation.

“Just got to do my job,” said 22-year-old Hart, who grew up idolizing Price. “That’s what it comes down to at the end of the day.”

Kotkaniemi shovelled a shot towards the Flyers’ net with Price on the bench for an extra attacker with 50 seconds left, but Hart was there again as Philadelphia, which blocked 24 shots on the night, improved to 34-0-2 this season when leading after two periods.

“Their goaltender played well,” Price said. “Sometimes you gotta tip your hat to a hot goaltender. We did all the right things to win.”

The Canadiens were coming off that Game 2 where they dominated the Flyers, who sat 18 points ahead of them in the standings when the NHL suspended its season because of COVID-19 in March, from start to finish minus head coach Claude Julien after he was rushed to hospital with chest pains Wednesday night.

Resting at home and expected to make a full recovery, the 60-year-old had a stent installed in one of his coronary arteries.

Perhaps looking to draw attention away from his team’s embarrassing performance Friday, Vigneault criticized Montreal associate coach Kirk Muller, who is running the bench in Julien’s absence, for putting his No. 1 power-play unit out in the dying minutes of a blowout.

The Flyers had a much better start Sunday against the speedy Canadiens after failing to register a shot until there was 3:36 left in the opening period of Game 2. Philadelphia nudged in front at 5:21 of the first following an offensive zone faceoff when Voracek redirected the puck up off himself and in past Price after Claude Giroux took the initial shot.

Montreal came close later in the period, with Kotkaniemi, who has four goals during the restart, whipping a shot off the post before Brett Kulak blasted his effort off the crossbar seconds later.

“It was a tight game,” Kotkaniemi said. “We had the chances we needed. Just need to bury them.”

The Canadiens then had to kill off a four-minute penalty to Kotkaniemi for high-sticking on former Montreal teammate Nate Thompson, and got some good fortune of their own when Travis Konecny found iron on a shot through a screen.

Ranked 24th of the 24 teams included in the resumption of play, the Canadiens didn’t have the same jump as in Game 2, but still had a number of chances in the second to get even.

“We didn’t get the same flow through the middle as the last game,” Muller said. “We got caught more into the boards. There’s some corrections that we can make, but we didn’t you utilize our speed as much.”

Gallagher, who has yet to find the back of the net in the post-season tournament despite a league-high 31 shots, hit the outside of the post and then forced a good save out of Hart off a turnover.

“No sense in feeling sorry for yourself,” Gallagher said of his dry spell after scoring 22 times in 2019-20. “Gotta find a way to battle through that. You gotta try and fight the urge to be frustrated.

“It’s a waste of emotion.”

The Flyers netminder then stopped Nick Suzuki with his glove on a Canadiens power play before the Montreal rookie hit another post on a short-handed 2-on-1.

Jonathan Drouin then jumped on a Scott Laughton giveaway, but Hart was there again to shut the door on a night where Montreal probably deserved a better fate.

“Our guys didn’t quit,” Muller said. “It was great effort.”

JASON FRANSON/The Canadian Press

Corey Crawford made 48 saves in a stellar performance, and Chicago beat the Vegas Golden Knights 3-1 on Sunday night to stay alive in their first-round playoff series.

Drake Caggiula and Matthew Highmore scored first-period goals for Chicago, and Alex DeBrincat added an empty-netter with 10 seconds left. Chicago handed Robin Lehner his first loss in a Golden Knights uniform since the goaltender was acquired in a trade with Chicago in February.

Vegas suffered its first loss since arriving in Edmonton for the NHL restart. The Golden Knights will have another chance to close out Chicago in Game 5 on Tuesday.

Shea Theodore scored his fourth playoff goal for Vegas in the first period when his shot from the point slipped through traffic in front of the net. But it was the only time the Golden Knights managed to beat Crawford on a night when the playoff-tested veteran was the best player on the ice.

Crawford, who was in net when Chicago won the Stanley Cup in 2013 and 2015, set a playoff career high for a regulation game.

Playing less than 24 hours after a 2-1 loss in Game 3, Crawford was under attack from the outset, especially after Chicago took a 2-0 lead on Highmore’s unexpected goal. Highmore threw a shot on net from below the goal-line and got a fortunate deflection when Lehner attempted to redirect the puck with his head, but instead sent it into his net.

Theodore’s shot slipped through, but nothing else did. Crawford was up to every challenge, especially as the Golden Knights continued to test him with high shots to the glove side. Crawford made a diving save on Max Pacioretty and stuffed William Karlsson on a breakaway in the second period.

But Crawford’s best sequence may have come midway through the third period when he stopped Karlsson’s attempt with his mask, and then gloved Zach Whitecloud’s wrist shot from inside the right circle.

Chicago’s penalty killers also had a solid night. Vegas went 0 for 3 with the man advantage and has not scored a power-play goal in the series. Chicago has killed off the past 14 power plays dating to its qualifying round matchup with Edmonton.

Lehner had won all seven of his starts since arriving in Vegas – three in the regular season and four in Edmonton. Lehner made 22 saves.

The CFL’s board of governors will meet Monday to determine the fate of the 2020 season after the league was unable to secure financial assistance from the federal government.

The CFL presented Ottawa with a $30-million, interest-free loan request Aug. 3 to stage an abbreviated 2020 season during the COVID-19 pandemic. But two sources familiar with the situation said Sunday night the plan fell through when the assistance couldn’t be provided to the league under the terms it sought.

The sources were granted anonymity because neither the CFL nor the federal government had divulged details of the loan request.

Story continues below advertisement

It wasn’t the first time the CFL had been unable to reach a deal for government assistance. Last month, the league ruled out a loan from the Business Development Bank of Canada because it felt the interest rate was too high.

The $30-million, interest-free loan request was essentially seen as the league’s last-ditch effort to secure government support for an abbreviated ’20 season

The CFL’s board of governors will meet Monday to determine its next course of action. However, it’s hard to see the league going ahead with a shortened season given the time of year and it stating repeatedly that government assistance was needed in order to stage an abbreviated campaign.

Earlier, a CFL source had told The Canadian Press that even with an abbreviated season the league would lose upwards of $50 million compared to between $60 and $80 million with no football at all.

The CFL sent Ottawa its $30-million loan request Aug. 3. It was a reduction of the $44-million amended requisition it presented last month.

The CFL first approached the federal government in April for up to $150 million in assistance due to the pandemic.

Until Friday, the CFL’s loan request rested firmly in the hands of the Public Health Agency of Canada, which had been in talks with the league and Manitoba health officials regarding the CFL’s return-to-play safety plans. The league had previously chosen Winnipeg as a tentative hub city for a shortened season.

Story continues below advertisement

On Friday, Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada’s deputy chief public health officer, reiterated he was encouraged about the CFL’s health-and-safety protocols. However, he couldn’t say when approval of the plan might come.

That painted a rather bleak picture for the CFL as a continued delay further diminishes chances for a season to be played.

Players would need to fulfil quarantine requirements and make their way to Winnipeg for training camps before a six-game season could begin. With a three-week playoff, the league is running out of time if it hopes to finish a season by early December.

But government money isn’t the only hurdle the league faces. It also has to reach an agreement with the CFL Players’ Association on an amended collective bargaining agreement, something that hasn’t happened yet.

The CFL regular season was supposed to kick off June 11. But many provincial governments had stated there would be no sports with large crowds over the summer due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.

That struck a serious blow to the CFL, a gate-driven league that relies heavily on ticket sales to operate.

Kei Nishikori, the 2014 U.S. Open runner-up, tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday and said he will pull out of the tune-up tournament at Flushing Meadows that starts next week.

Nishikori posted what he called “some unfortunate news” on his mobile app.

While he is withdrawing from the Western & Southern Open – a hard-court event usually held in Cincinnati but moved this year to the U.S. Open site in New York because of the coronavirus pandemic – he did not say what his plans are for the Grand Slam tournament that begins Aug. 31.

The 30-year-old from Japan said he is in Florida, where he is based, and had planned to fly to New York on Monday. But that plan was scrapped.

He will offer an update on his status Friday.

Top-seeded Simona Halep defeated third-seeded Elise Mertens 6-2, 7-5 in the Prague Open final on Sunday to claim her 21st WTA title.

The second-ranked Romanian broke Mertens for a 6-5 lead in the final set before converting her first match point to win her second title this year after the Dubai Championships in February.

Before the Wimbledon champion recovered from a foot injury she sustained in Dubai, the coronavirus pandemic forced a five-month break.

It was the eighth title on clay for Halep, the first since she won the 2018 French Open. Among the active players, only Serena Williams with 13 and her sister Venus with nine, won more titles on clay.

The No. 23-ranked Mertens jumped to a 2-0 lead in the opening set before Halep took charge, taking six straight games.

Halep improved her record against her Belgian opponent to 4-1 at WTA tournaments.

After the final, Halep said she would decide on Monday if she is ready to play at the forthcoming U.S. Open.

The Prague Open is the second European tournament since the WTA restarted last week with the Palermo Open amid the coronavirus pandemic, with strict health protocols in place and no fans in the stands and no media except a television broadcaster.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prorogued Parliament Tuesday, saying he needs a Throne Speech to launch a new recovery plan and insisting the move is consistent with his party’s pledge not to misuse the procedural move.

Mr. Trudeau made the announcement the same day that he named Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland as the new Finance Minister, a position vacated Monday by the resignation of Bill Morneau. She is the country’s first woman in that role.

In proroguing Parliament until Sept. 23, Mr. Trudeau shuts down committee investigations into the Liberal government’s WE Charity controversy. The Prime Minister promised a Throne Speech when Parliament returns and a confidence vote, which could trigger a federal election if the minority government Liberals fail to win the support of at least one of the three main opposition parties.

The Prime Minister said prorogation and a Throne Speech are necessary because the world has changed since the government approved its initial Throne Speech in December, which was based on the Liberal Party’s 2019 campaign pledges.

Background: For Chrystia Freeland, the political is personal

Freeland’s appointment completes the centralization of power in Trudeau’s office

Freeland just inherited the hardest job in Canada. How long can she keep it?

“We do not want an election. But it is obvious that the Throne Speech we gave eight months ago is no longer relevant for the reality that Canadians are living and that our government is facing,” Mr. Trudeau told reporters at a news conference on Parliament Hill. “There are many things we committed to Canadians in that Throne Speech that we will be continuing to work on, but many others that aren’t the priority that they once were. ... I think it is important that Canadians have a clear idea of the plan that we have for building a stronger economy that is more inclusive, that is greener, that is fairer for all Canadians.”

The Liberal Party’s 2015 election campaign platform included a specific pledge not to abuse the use of prorogation, after criticizing the former Conservative prime minister’s use of the procedural tool.

“We will not resort to legislative tricks to avoid scrutiny,” the platform said. “Stephen Harper has used prorogation to prevent Parliament from properly reviewing and debating his proposals.” The platform said House of Commons rules would be changed “to bring an end to this undemocratic process.”

Mr. Harper faced criticism for proroguing Parliament in December, 2008, during the onset of the global financial crisis, at a time when opposition parties were planning to defeat his minority Conservative government. The prorogation bought the government time and allowed it to survive confidence votes when Parliament resumed the next month. Mr. Harper’s third of four prorogations in power was also controversial. The December, 2009, prorogation had the effect of shutting down a politically sensitive parliamentary investigation into the government’s handling of Afghan detainees.

During the Trudeau government’s first four-year term, Parliament was never prorogued.

When asked about that campaign pledge, Mr. Trudeau insisted the current situation is different.

“Stephen Harper and the Conservatives prorogued Parliament in order to shut it down and avoid a confidence vote. We are proroguing Parliament to bring it back on exactly the same week it was supposed to come back anyway and force a confidence vote,” he said.

The House of Commons was scheduled to sit for one day next week as part of an agreement with the NDP earlier in the year to continue the suspension of regular sitting days while allowing some committee work to continue. There have only been 45 regular sitting days since the October, 2019, election because of suspensions related to the novel coronavirus.

Regular sitting days were scheduled to resume on Monday, Sept. 21. Mr. Trudeau could have decided to allow committee work to continue and to prorogue just before the Throne Speech, rather than immediately.

The effect of prorogation is that regular committee work is shut down as all bills and committee studies die.

The existing bills and committee studies are not necessarily ended for good, however. Procedural options exist for MPs to approve motions that would reinstate bills and studies back to the stages they were at at the time of prorogation.

Mr. Trudeau said that documents related to the now-cancelled contract with the WE Charity designed to help students during the pandemic would still be released.

“I can say that we have released all those documents to the members of the committee so that they can spend their time going through those mountains of documents over the coming weeks so that they can continue to ask any questions they like on this issue,” he said.

Opposition MPs on the House of Commons finance committee have received an estimated 5,000 pages of documents.

At the time of the Speech from the Throne, a new Conservative leader will be in place. A leader is to be named on Sunday and will have to hit the ground running in preparation for a possible election.

The decision to prorogue Parliament was met with disdain from opposition parties on Tuesday.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the prorogation is aimed at blocking the WE Charity investigation.

“Earlier this year, Justin Trudeau shamefully shut down Parliament to try and avoid accountability. Now he has locked out opposition MPs who were working hard to fix his government’s pandemic programs [and] help Canadians and get to the bottom of his corruption scandal,” he said in a statement. “Justin Trudeau is walking out on Canadians in the middle of a major health and economic crisis, in a disgusting attempt to make Canadians forget about his corruption.”

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said shutting down Parliament in the middle of a pandemic and an economic crisis is wrong.

“Canadians shouldn’t be forced to pay the price for Mr. Trudeau’s scandals,” he said on Twitter.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Singh told reporters in Vancouver that this week’s events are “deeply troubling” and a sign that the Liberals are more focused on themselves rather than dealing with the pandemic.

“It seems like the Liberal government is more interested in throwing the finance minister under the bus than the Prime Minister taking responsibility for his own breaches of conflict-of-interest laws and his own breaches when it comes to scandals,” Mr. Singh said.

Prior to Mr. Trudeau’s prorogation announcement, he was at Rideau Hall for a ceremony to swear in Ms. Freeland to the critical finance portfolio.

On Monday, Bill Morneau, who had served in the role since 2015, announced he was leaving the Trudeau cabinet. Mr. Morneau is also resigning as an MP. The resignation followed several media reports of disagreements between the two men, but both praised each other in their public comments this week.

Both are the subject of investigations by the Ethics Commissioner related to a now-cancelled contract with WE Charity to administer a program for students during the pandemic.

The Ethics Commissioner will proceed with his report on Mr. Morneau even if he is no longer an office holder, his office confirmed on Tuesday.

At a committee hearing into the issue last month, Mr. Morneau revealed that he had reimbursed $41,366 to WE Charity for travel expenses that the group covered for personal trips his family took to Kenya and Ecuador in 2017.

He is the only finance minister that Mr. Trudeau has had since his government came to power in 2015.

Mr. Trudeau thanked Mr. Morneau for his service, adding that he counted on the minister’s leadership, advice and close friendship over the years.

The swearing-in of the new cabinet was the first of its kind during the pandemic. Those attending the ceremony wore masks, and chairs at the ceremony were spaced out to enable physical distancing.

Ms. Freeland, who was first elected in 2013, will be the first female finance minister in Canadian history, and she is regarded in Liberal circles as a good listener, strong communicator and as being able to take on significant undertakings for the government.

From 2015 to 2017, Ms. Freeland served as the international trade minister and oversaw the renegotiation of Canada’s free trade agreement with the European Union.

From January, 2017, to November, 2019, she held the Foreign Affairs portfolio and concluded the renegotiation of the North American free-trade agreement between Canada, Mexico and the United States.

Ms. Freeland is also a former journalist and author.

She expressed hope that her appointment will inspire other women and signalled that her focus is on crafting an economic recovery plan that includes a strong environmental focus and addresses the fact that the economic impact of the pandemic “is hitting women particularly hard.”

“I am conscious of the fact that I am Canada’s first woman Finance Minister,” she said. “It’s about time that we broke that glass ceiling. I’d like to say to all the Canadian women across our amazing country who are out there breaking glass ceilings: Keep going.”

Representing Canada during trade talks with the United States involved regular discussions with provincial and territorial premiers, who must approve aspects of any trade deals that fall under their jurisdiction.

As Deputy Prime Minister, the Alberta-born Ms. Freeland was assigned to keep working closely with the provinces on a range of issues including sensitive such as energy policy. That role increased substantially at the onset of the pandemic, as she was placed in charge of a special COVID-19 cabinet committee and was Ottawa’s main contact with the premiers to co-ordinate Canada’s pandemic response plan.

Ms. Freeland negotiated with the provinces on a federal pandemic support package, which increased from an initial offer of $14-billion to $19-billion when it was finalized in July.

“It’s very likely that all the premiers would share the perspective that Minister Freeland, in her previous roles, whether it was COVID or prior to that with trade discussions, was very willing to reach out to the premiers, me included,” Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister told The Globe and Mail Tuesday.

“I appreciated that dialogue and I think that’s going to be essential moving forward.”

Mr. Pallister said “of course I’m concerned” about the instability in Ottawa as the finance minister is replaced in the middle of a pandemic, but praised the fact that Mr. Morneau’s replacement was announced quickly.

Another Progressive Conservative Premier also had high praise for Ms. Freeland and her appointment as Finance Minister.

“There’s no secret, I think the world of Chrystia,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford told reporters at an event in Scarborough that included a call for more federal funding for public transit.

“I sent her a message this morning. She was strong as Deputy Prime Minister, and if there is one person I have confidence in, it’s Chrystia Freeland, that we can work together, we can sit down, pick up the phone. And one of the first phone calls – I’ll let her get settled in – but we need money for the transit system,” he said. “There’s no better person I’d want to work with than Chrystia Freeland. She’s going to do an incredible job. She’s a good friend and I can’t wait to start working with her to move our projects forward.”

Jerry Dias, the president of Unifor, said Tuesday that he worked hand-in-hand with Ms. Freeland during the renegotiation of the new U.S. free-trade agreement. Mr. Dias said she will bring a broad understanding of people to her new role as Finance Minister.

“She is deeply principled ... I watched her dealing with the United States, I watched her dealing with [U.S. President Donald] Trump on the softwood lumber dispute. I watched her deal with the aluminum tariffs during the [free-trade] debate,” he said. “I know her. I respect her.”

The decision by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to shut down Parliament for six weeks could disrupt opposition efforts to probe the WE Charity controversy and mean the end of a special committee investigating the crisis in Canada-China relations, which the Liberals initially voted against creating.

Opposition MPs outnumber the members of the minority Liberal government on committees and can therefore override the governing party to call hearings, but Mr. Trudeau’s move to prorogue Parliament shuts down all committee activity until the new session begins Sept. 23. Even after that, there will likely be weeks of delay before committees resume operating.

Three different Commons committees were investigating the WE Charity controversy, including the finance committee, the ethics committee and the government operations committee. As standing committees, they will be reconstituted when Parliament comes back.

Trudeau prorogues Parliament until Sept. 23 after appointing Freeland Finance Minister

Prorogation of Parliament: what does it mean and what happens next?

‘Proroguing’ isn’t a dirty word in itself – but the power to reset Parliament demands our vigilance

“This makes the investigation go dark for six weeks,” Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre said.

The Conservative Party and New Democrats also registered serious concern Tuesday about the future of the Special Committee on Canada-China Relations. As a special committee created by a vote in the House of Commons, it would need to be voted back into existence when Parliament returns.

The committee was in the midst of preparing a report on the crisis in Hong Kong and was expecting to hear from former ambassador John McCallum in September. Any planned reports cannot be issued now.

For its part, the finance committee had planned to hold more meetings on the WE controversy in August and early September, according to Mr. Poilievre.

He accused Mr. Trudeau of proroguing to tamp down a controversy that has hurt his government. The Prime Minister could have held off on prorogation until the night before a planned Throne Speech this fall and let the committees keep operating, Mr. Poilievre said.

“Justin Trudeau is desperate to hide the truth,” Mr. Poilievre said.

Before taking power, Mr. Trudeau campaigned against using prorogation to avoid tough questions. “Stephen Harper has used prorogation to avoid difficult political circumstances. We will not,” the Liberal Party’s 2015 list of campaign promises said.

Still, an estimated 5,000 page of documents related to the WE Charity contract have been released. Mr. Poilievre said the clerk of the Common’s finance committee has made this commitment. The documents are being saved on USB sticks for committee members.

WE Charity is affiliated with several related charities and the for-profit ME to WE company. It has been embroiled in controversy since striking a deal with the federal government for a contract to run a $543.5-million program to pay students for volunteer work. The agreement was cancelled on July 3 amid conflict-of interest allegations against Mr. Trudeau.

The minority Liberal government opposed the formation of the China committee and voted against its creation in December, 2019, but it was outnumbered by opposition votes as the Bloc Québécois and NDP backed the Conservative motion. Relations between the two countries have deteriorated significantly since China locked up two Canadians in apparent retaliation for Ottawa’s arrest of a Huawei executive on a U.S. extradition request.

Conservative MP Garnett Genuis, who was a member of the Canada-China committee, said its dissolution interferes with an urgent need to issue recommendations on what Canada can do to help Hong Kong as the Chinese Communist Party cracks down on democratic freedoms in the former British colony.

NDP MP Jack Harris, another member of the China committee, said he’s angry about what has happened and will seek to resurrect it.

Peter Fragiskatos, a Liberal member of the committee, said he would like to see the China committee resume after prorogation. “I think the committee has done very good work and we’ve heard from some extremely strong witnesses who have given us a really good idea about the nature of the Canada-China relationship.”

Philippe Lagassé is associate professor at Carleton University. He researches the Westminster system.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced that Parliament will be prorogued until late September – and Canadians can be forgiven for thinking that this move is suspect.

Ever since Stephen Harper advised governor-general Michaëlle Jean to prorogue parliament in 2008, saving his minority Conservative government, the very word “prorogue” has been associated with controversy. Last fall’s aborted prorogation of the British Parliament by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which the United Kingdom Supreme Court quashed in an unprecedented ruling, has only fuelled the sense that this is an illegitimate power.

Prorogation’s bad rap probably explains why Mr. Trudeau avoided proroguing the last Parliament altogether; nothing prevented him from proroguing, but not doing so set him apart from his predecessor. His decision now to prorogue until Sept. 23 – amid the simmering scandal over WE Charity and after the resignation of his finance minister – looks cynical as a result. Given that Parliament was to return in late September anyway, a prorogation of just over a month may not seem all that dramatic, but the fact that the committees holding hearings into the WE Charity will no longer be meeting is significant. Whether this is a fair characterization depends on the government’s ability to show it was necessary, and for Canadians to decide if they agree.

Trudeau prorogues Parliament until Sept. 23 after appointing Freeland Finance Minister

Prorogation of Parliament: What does it mean and what happens next?

But the mere mention of the word “prorogue” need not, on its own, trigger alarm bells. Prorogation does serve a purpose, and is usually deployed without nefarious intent. It is important to judge each prorogation on its own merits.

Prorogation ends a parliamentary session, allowing a new one to start. When a session is ended, all parliamentary business stops: Government bills that haven’t become law must be reintroduced, unless the House of Commons reinstates them, and committees cease to function, their inquiries halted, and they must be reconstituted when the new session begins. When Parliament resumes, the governor-general reads a new Speech from the Throne outlining the plans for the new session – allowing the government to highlight new priorities, with the deck cleared of parliamentary business to make room for them – before the legislature’s business gets under way again.

Prorogation, then, is an act of renewal within a single parliament. Used in this way, it shouldn’t raise eyebrows. If a parliament has been in session for a while, it may be time for a refresh.

The problem is that this power can be abused, especially in minority parliaments, to allow prime ministers to delay scrutiny, avoid votes of non-confidence or otherwise undermine the will of parliament. Mr. Harper’s 2008 prorogation prevented the opposition from bringing down his government and replacing it with a loose-knit and ultimately unstable coalition. On Dec. 30, 2009, Mr. Harper again prorogued Parliament, until March 3, 2010, leading critics to charge that he was interfering with a committee inquiry into Canada’s handling of Afghan detainees. The U.K. government’s attempted prorogation last year, meanwhile, was a naked effort to take back control of Brexit from Parliament.

Prorogations that last weeks or months are usually bad news. There’s no need for prorogations to last very long – Canada has no standard length, but the British average is eight calendar days – and Parliament should sit as often as it can. A long prorogation is obviously made worse when committees are looking into troubling government behaviour. Ending a parliamentary session when a vote of non-confidence is looming amounts to a constitutional crisis. When used in these ways, prorogation is the effective equivalent of what U.S. constitutional scholar Mark Tushnet calls “constitutional hardball,” employing legitimate powers in ways that violate wider norms.

Is there a way to prevent prime ministers from abusing prorogation? The 2008 prorogation led many to argue that Ms. Jean should have rejected Mr. Harper’s advice to prorogue. Had she done so, that would arguably have prompted Mr. Harper’s resignation, leading to a change of government before the Commons formally withdrew confidence. Tempting though it may be, expecting the viceregal representative to refuse a prime minister’s advice to prorogue – even if the government appears on the cusp of losing confidence – risks dragging the governor-general into partisan frays. In the end, Ms. Jean judged – rightly – that it was for the Commons to decide Mr. Harper’s fate, rather than make that decision herself.

Story continues below advertisement

Another option is to regulate prorogation in law. While the British Parliament can do whatever it wants with the prorogation prerogative, our legislature is more constrained, given our codified constitution. The power to prorogue Parliament belongs to the office of the governor-general under paragraph 41(a) of the Constitution Act, 1982, meaning that passing a law to terminate or modify the power would require the unanimous consent of all the provinces and the two Houses of Parliament. Imposing statutory limits on prorogation without a constitutional amendment would be legally dubious.

In a Canadian context, preventing improper prorogations depends on making them politically costly. Our heads of government should be named and shamed if they advise extended, tactical prorogations rather than short, purposeful ones. This isn’t a great solution, but it may be the only one we’ve got – now, it’s up to Canadians to decide if this prorogation is too long given the Trudeau government’s troubles.

Lori Turnbull is the director of the School of Public Administration at Dalhousie University and the deputy editor of Canadian Government Executive magazine.

Back in 2015, Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party ran on an ambitious platform that promised to do government differently. They proposed a fresh, modern take on what they defined as antiquated institutions: cabinet, the Senate, the electoral system and the appointments process.

The Liberals would go on to win a majority government, and in those early days, Mr. Trudeau spoke of his intent to employ a “government by cabinet” approach, which would trust and empower ministers to own their own files and do their jobs. He would support rather than script and second-guess the ministers in his gender-equal cabinet, whom he said he chose because of their personal and professional credentials rather than their loyalty to him or the Liberal Party. It would be on the basis of these qualities, he said, that he would pledge his confidence in his ministers.

But in that “antiquated” system of parliamentary governance in which we operate, the concept of “confidence” has tremendous significance. The legitimacy of a government ultimately depends on whether it holds the confidence of the elected legislature. Cabinet ministers serve in their roles as long as they enjoy the confidence of the Prime Minister. And while the meaning of confidence is hard to pin down with any degree of exactness, it is not achieved simply by meeting expectations with respect to competence or compliance with rules. Confidence goes deeper than that; it is synonymous with trust.

That’s relevant now, as we’ve been hearing a lot about confidence lately – and, in some cases, a possible lack thereof. A year after Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott resigned in connection with the SNC-Lavalin affair, with both citing a lack of confidence in the government’s handling of the issue, another high-profile cabinet minister – Bill Morneau, who has tended to the Canadian economy during the pandemic – announced Monday that he would be stepping down.

The Finance Minister’s departure comes amid probes by the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner and two standing House committees around a now-cancelled multimillion-dollar distribution arrangement between the federal government and WE Charity. Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Morneau, who failed to recuse themselves from cabinet’s decision despite family ties to WE Charity, have been at the centre of the controversy. In recent weeks, Mr. Trudeau has assured Canadians that his crisis-time Finance Minister had his “full confidence.” Now, he’s headed for the door.

In his evening news conference, Mr. Morneau – rather than the Prime Minister himself, notably – told Canadians that he was not pushed out. From an optics perspective, a voluntary resignation is the only version of events that remaining cabinet ministers could hope to defend. After all, how could the Prime Minister fire his most senior minister for the same kinds of mistakes he is alleged to have made himself on the same file?

On the other hand, keeping Mr. Morneau around wasn’t working, either: The Prime Minister’s frequent expressions of confidence in him sounded forced. And Mr. Trudeau’s words would’ve been more reassuring had he not been himself involved in the WE situation and if he hadn’t begun a public courtship of former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney to assist with Canada’s economic recovery.

The WE scandal damaged Mr. Morneau’s reputation, but the fallout from that could have been managed. Still, it seemed to be the tipping point in the Prime Minister’s confidence in his Finance Minister, despite his ambitious visions of a new style of government.

The departures of Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott were noteworthy for how they expressed a lack of confidence in the Prime Minister, rather than the other way around. And with Mr. Morneau – left out in the cold as he watched his boss make inroads with Mr. Carney, but apparently still interested in public service as he prepares to run for secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development – there appeared to have been the same crisis of confidence.

For now at least, Mr. Morneau will be replaced in the finance portfolio by Chrystia Freeland, the “minister of everything” in whom the Prime Minister clearly has boundless confidence. He has hers, too: When asked to comment on her boss’s role in WE Charity, she said she has “complete confidence” in Mr. Trudeau. Her appointment will surely help the government reset itself, but Mr. Morneau’s departure remains a loud statement on what confidence means in Justin Trudeau’s “government done differently.”

The blockade, which began at 7 a.m., saw dozens of demonstrators occupy two ramps leading to the parking garage at the Superior Court of Ontario.

The event was organized by tenant advocacy organizations People’s DefenceTO and Keep Your Rent Toronto – both of which have been fighting efforts by landlords to evict tenants during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Kabir Joshi, an organizer with the two groups, said the demonstration was just one of a continuing series of community-organized events to prevent property management companies from evicting vulnerable tenants.

“This conversation has been happening for six months,” Mr. Joshi said, pointing out calls from housing activists to freeze rent payments going as far back as March.

“People who are just holding on by the skin of their teeth to continue existing in this city … this pandemic was gonna push them out.”

The Ministry of the Attorney General of Ontario did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Last month, Queen’s Park passed Bill 184 – the Protecting Tenants and Strengthening Community Housing Act – which received widespread condemnation from housing-rights activists who say the law gave landlords excessive power to evict tenants.

Under the new law, landlords can offer a direct repayment plan to tenants who are behind on rent without going through the Landlord and Tenant Board.

The province has said the bill actually helps tenants, but critics and legal analysts have warned that the law would permit landlords to use a tenant’s refusal to sign onto a repayment plan as justification to evict.

At the end of July, Toronto city council voted 22-2 to mount a legal challenge against the bill, citing concerns over the potential for vulnerable tenants to be coerced into a high-interest repayment plan or face eviction and potentially homelessness.

Paterson Hodgson, a tenant at Westlodge Towers in Parkdale and housing-rights organizer, is not confident elected officials will make much of a difference in the battle against pandemic evictions.

“There’s always opportunity for politicians to support their constituents, but in my relatively short life, I haven’t seen them do a lot,” she said.

“Community organizing, regional-based organizing is showing results that we don’t get from politicians. We don’t have to wait for them to step up, we can do it ourselves.”

Although she hasn’t been served a notice of eviction yet, Ms. Hodgson said she is currently behind on rent, and has repeatedly been asked to sign an unreasonable repayment plan by her landlord.

Ms. Hodgson, a work-from-home illustrator, said it has been difficult getting in contact with everyone in her building because of physical distancing restrictions owing to COVID-19, but she believes dozens of her neighbours are in a similar situation.

Alberta, which is struggling to pinpoint sources for hundreds of new coronavirus infections, intends to beef up its contact-tracing team, according to the provincial health authority.

Alberta Health Services (AHS) plans to hire 140 contact tracers over the next several weeks, spokesman Kerry Williamson said. This is on top of the 560 people AHS expects to be on the team by the end of the week. In April, when the first wave of the pandemic hit the province, about 440 people were assigned to investigate infections.

AHS has been slow to identify the roots of a burst of new COVID-19 cases in the Edmonton zone, 405 between Aug. 11 and Aug. 17. While the number of new daily cases is now lower than it was in April, AHS is expanding its detective unit because investigations have become more complex. People widened their social circles after public-health restrictions eased and pandemic fatigue set in. They are also travelling more. This means it takes contact tracers longer to determine who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, giving the virus more time to spread.

“It is taking longer than we would like right now,” Deena Hinshaw, Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer, told reporters on Tuesday. “We’re working on resolving that.”

Dr. Hinshaw wants people who test positive for COVID-19 to be notified within 12 hours. Sometimes, to get the results out as soon as possible, AHS splits notification calls from contact-tracing calls, she said.

Now, 78 per cent of people who test positive are notified by contact tracers within 24 hours, AHS said. The rest receive word within 48 hours. Contact-tracing investigations start within 48 hours of test results in 43 per cent of cases, AHS said, and the rest generally begin within 72 hours. A contact-tracing investigation currently takes about six hours, AHS said.

British Columbia last week said it was hiring 500 contact tracers.

Alberta has 1,169 active COVID-19 cases, and the Edmonton region accounts for 636 of those. Mayor Don Iveson on Tuesday said he was “concerned and disappointed” with the rising case count.

“We’re reaching out to [AHS] to get more details on this rise in cases so we can help protect communities most at risk,” he said in a tweet.

Dr. Hinshaw last week said investigators needed more time to identify the sources. On Tuesday, she pointed to several social events.

Alberta has linked 15 cases to a prayer gathering dubbed It Is Time Canada on the August long weekend near Deadwood, a hamlet in the northwestern part of the province. B.C. has tied 17 COVID-19 cases to the event. Dr. Hinshaw said about 200 to 300 people attended, and she expects more related cases.

Edmonton’s Bible Pentecostal Church is the source of a separate outbreak, with 15 confirmed cases, she said. About 150 people worship at the church, Dr. Hinshaw said. Further, Alberta has traced 26 cases to a private gathering and 17 to another.

“It is a stark reminder that coming together in large gatherings risks sharing more than fellowship,” she said. “It risks sharing the COVID-19 virus.”

In central Alberta, a meat-processing plant sent more than a dozen employees home after a worker tested positive for the virus last week.

The employee at the Olymel facility in Red Deer was sent home and told to get tested after showing symptoms of COVID-19 on Aug. 11, a company spokesman said. Richard Vigneault said the positive result came in two days later, and 13 other employees were tested. Mr. Vigneault said the company expects the results soon.

British Columbia and Alberta racked up hundreds of new coronavirus infections over the weekend, a surge among young adults that set a new pandemic record in B.C. and has made Edmonton a national hot spot for COVID-19.

B.C., in an effort to stamp out community spread, on Monday said it is examining the legal tools it has to crack down on people partying on private property, a break from the government’s light-handed approach. It counted 236 new cases of COVID-19 over the weekend, bringing active cases to 743, a new high for the Western province. Alberta added 359 new cases on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, bringing the provincial total to 1,132 active cases. The Edmonton region counted 593 active cases as of Sunday, with the number of cases in the capital surpassing those in Montreal by a factor of four, when adjusted for population.

As the number of new cases in Ontario and Quebec, the two hardest-hit provinces in the country, hold steady, the surges among young adults in the West have prompted officials to beg people under 40 to stick to the public-health guidelines. But COVID-19 statistics show they are resisting the recommendations.

“Young people are getting out more,” Donna Wilson, a nursing professor at the University of Alberta, said. “Young adults tend to have confidence that they have the health so even if they catch it, it won’t be serious.”

In British Columbia, Health Minister Adrian Dix told reporters on Monday that while it can be maddening to see beaches and sidewalks of Vancouver’s Granville Strip nightlife area very crowded as they were this past weekend, smaller groups partying indoors pose a much greater public-health risk.

Half of the Vancouver area’s eight public spaces linked to outbreaks currently listed by the local health authority happened at high-end lounges and nightclubs. Three of those, Pierre’s Champagne Lounge, West Oak and the IVY Lounge in Trump International Hotel and Tower have been ordered closed, Mr. Dix said.

The province has already put in new rules limiting guests at Airbnb and other short-term rentals, but is having a harder time stopping people from welcoming groups of friends into their homes at night, Mr. Dix said.

""The places where there's greatest danger is private parties where alcohol is involved and it's inside,"" he said.

The provincial government has been reticent to crack down on indoor events given the importance of respecting a person’s privacy in their own home, which Mr. Dix said “dates back to the Magna Carta.” But these parties are now a driving force in new infections and the Solicitor-General is studying new ways to enforce physical distancing inside private properties, Mr. Dix said.

“Don’t hold private parties,” he said. “Twenty to 40 may be seen as young ... but it’s not young, and the people I’ve met over this weekend understand that and understand their obligation to one another, and to their parents and to their grandparents.”

Deena Hinshaw, Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, last week said her province has not yet determined what is driving the wave of new cases in Edmonton, save for exposure at home. People under the age of 40 accounted for 77 per cent of cases in northeast Edmonton and the median age for infected Edmontonians is 30, she said in her update last Wednesday.

“We have seen in Edmonton, many of our recent cases, have been spread within households,” she said last week. The Edmonton zone added 407 new cases between Aug. 10 and Aug. 16.

There are roughly 52 active cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 in the city of Edmonton, according to Alberta’s data. By way of comparison, the rate of cases on the Island of Montreal clocked in at 13 per 100,000 last week.

Key differences for students

Attendance: In Quebec - which has the strictest policies for in-class instruction - attendance is mandatory for all elementary and high-school students. The only exceptions occur if a class suffers an outbreak (in which case they’ll be sent home and continue studies there), a student has a doctor’s note saying they’re at high risk of COVID-19, or a student lives with a high-risk individual. Ontario, by contrast, requires school boards to provide remote-learning options for those who want them.

Ontario, by contrast, requires school boards to provide remote-learning options for those who want them. Masks: Masks will be mandatory in all classrooms in Ontario for grades 4 to 12. Alberta has restrictions for the same grades in settings where physical distancing can’t be maintained; Calgary’s two main boards are going a step further, requiring masks for all grades, though not necessarily in classrooms. In Quebec, B.C., Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, masks are required for middle- and high-school grades in common areas like halls and buses. But in other jurisdictions, it’s generally up to students or school boards to decide on masking practices, and schools may vary in their policies about when and how many masks can be provided to students who don’t have their own.

But in other jurisdictions, it’s generally up to students or school boards to decide on masking practices, and schools may vary in their policies about when and how many masks can be provided to students who don’t have their own. Cohorting: Most provinces will aim to have cohorts (B.C. calls them “learning groups”) to limit how many students come in contact with each other. In Quebec, Ontario and Alberta, the cohort is the class itself, though Ontario is also capping the size of high-school classrooms in high-risk areas to 15. B.C. allows the largest cohorts: 60 for elementary- and middle-school students, and 120 for high schoolers.

Key differences for teachers and staff

Masks: Mandatory mask policies will be more common for teachers and other school staff than for their pupils, but the rules aren’t consistent nationwide. They’ll be mandatory in many settings in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta schools. In B.C. and Nova Scotia, masks are optional. In Prince Edward Island, gloves and face shields are strongly recommended if staff are interacting with students with complex medical needs.

Indoors vs. outdoors: The federal COVID-19 guidance for schools encourages classes to be moved outside when the weather allows it, and jurisdictions like Nova Scotia plan to follow that advice. But thinking ahead to the winter, when outdoor instruction won’t be as easy, many school boards are pressing for ventilation upgrade that could reduce the airborne spread of the virus: Ontario has pledged $50-million for heating, ventilation and air conditioning improvements.

Transportation: In some provinces, the most complicated physical-distancing challenges fall to bus drivers, who will have to consider capacity limits (Quebec buses can have no more than 48 passengers) or fixed seating arrangements (Alberta pupils will have to stick to assigned seats). B.C. and Saskatchewan buses may have partitions for drivers. As for masks, they’re required for Manitoba’s bus drivers and encouraged in PEI but not necessarily required everywhere else.

Key differences for parents

Transportation: The Prairie provinces and PEI are strongly encouraging parents to take their children to school whenever possible, while in other jurisdictions, boards are adding new buses or walk-to-school programs to make physically distanced transportation easier.

Visiting: Some jurisdictions are limiting access to schools to staff and students only; parents may not be allowed to enter buildings. Instead, there will be designated outdoor pickup areas. Manitoba schools plan to have areas where students who report COVID-19 symptoms can be quarantined before pickup.

My child is going back to class. What can they do to get ready?

Learn how COVID-19 works

Because closing schools was one of the first steps taken in Canada and abroad when the pandemic was declared, little is known about how children contract or spread COVID-19. Children aren’t invulnerable to the virus, but the good news is that they make up far less of the infection toll than older people, and when they do get sick, their symptoms are often less severe. The bigger risk is that students with mild or absent symptoms will spread COVID-19 to teachers, family members or immunocompromised classmates who are more likely to get seriously ill. To prevent that, it’s essential that children know the COVID-19 symptoms (a dry cough, fever and difficulty breathing) and isolate themselves quickly if they’re not feeling well.

Talk about hygiene

Students at school will be expected to wash their hands a lot more often than usual, and may be given dedicated break times to do so. The video below demonstrates the federal government’s recommended practices for good hand-washing.

Talk about mental health

The pandemic has been a stressful time for everyone, including children who’ve been unable to see their friends or enjoy normal summer activities. But going back to school may give students new and more immediate anxieties to manage. Here are some pointers from the federal government on listening to your child’s concerns, and a mental-health hub for youth that includes various provincial crisis lines your child can contact if they’re in distress.

Help children stick to a routine

New school routines will be more regimented. They could include staggered lunch and recess breaks to avoid crowding, different lengths to the school day or an alternation between in-class and at-home learning on designated days of the week. Make sure that your child has a day planner or scheduling app and they keep it up to date.

Items to bring

The old standards: Pencils, pens, paper, scissors and other back-to-school staples are still as necessary as ever, even more so in schools with no-sharing policies to stop the spread of the virus on surfaces. Consider buying a washable pouch to store these items.

Consider buying a washable pouch to store these items. Computer: Some jurisdictions, like Nova Scotia, expect students to have their own computers that can be used for remote learning. If an outbreak sends the rest of the class home, this may be students’ only option for continuing lessons. If your child has a laptop or tablet, make sure they’re familiar with the software needed to stay in contact with their class; if they don’t, check with the school board to see if they provide computers or subsidies to buy one.

The trick is finding one that’s the right size for your child and can be worn comfortably for long periods of time.

I don’t want my child back in class. What are my options?

Virtual studies or home-schooling are still an option in some provinces, notably Ontario, but every family’s situation is different. Ultimately, it’s a question of assessing risk: Is it better to send a child to school and be ready if they get sick, or to keep the child at home and disrupt your family’s working routine? Risk-assessment experts who spoke with The Globe caution that, in a new situation like a pandemic, gut feelings can be less reliable than the advice of experts. But “there’s no right answer as to how that trade-off should go. Everything depends on your own values,” says Paul Slovic, a psychology professor at the University of Oregon.

Some families, skeptical of their local back-to-school plans, have begun organizing “education pods” like those that emerged in the United States over the summer. The idea is to have families pool resources to hire a private teacher to instruct children in small groups. But many education advocates say pods will only segregate privileged families from racialized and low-income ones who will have to face the risks of public education alone. “Wealthy families have the resources to do whatever they want. It’s not a luxury for us parents who have four or five kids,” says Sureya Ibrahim, an Ethiopian-Canadian community organizer in Toronto’s Regent Park neighbourhood.

Sustaining energy through four days of a political convention is never easy. It’s even more challenging during this, the first virtual convention. On the second night of the Democratic National Convention, party leaders tried to blend its past with its future.

Here are key take-aways from night two.

DEMOCRATS DISPLAY BIG TENT

Joe Biden, who was being formally nominated Tuesday night in a virtual roll call of states, doesn’t shy away from the obvious: He’s a 77-year-old white man leading a party that celebrates its racial and ethnic diversity and gets a majority of its votes from women.

Story continues below advertisement

He has at times offered himself as a bridge to bring together that coalition, calling himself a “transitional figure” for the party and the country.

Democrats tried to put that on vivid display, an ideological arc that spanned the New Democrat centrism of former President Bill Clinton to the new century progressive, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was born in 1989, the year after Biden’s first presidential run.

Democrats were trying to show that their party tolerates differences in ways that the Republican Party led by President Donald Trump does not. The Democrats honoured Clinton, and former president Jimmy Carter, along with the party’s nominee in 2004, former Secretary of State John Kerry. Cindy McCain, whose husband, John, was the Republican nominee in 2008, appeared in a video praising Biden.

Former President George W. Bush, the only living GOP ex-president, and Sen. Mitt Romney, the party’s nominee in 2012, will not be part of the Republican convention next week.

In a 17-person keynote address that was part relay, part reminder of the party’s blended constituencies, followed by a roll call of the states, the ethnic and racial contrast with Republicans is obvious. For Democrats, that was the point.

PUNCHES LANDED, NOT PULLED

Donald Trump’s journey to the presidency began with then-President Barack Obama mocking the reality TV star relentlessly during the White House correspondents’ dinner in 2011 – a brutal ribbing that propelled the notoriously sensitive mogul toward his 2016 run.

But nobody’s making jokes now. During the first two days of the Democratic National Convention, the party’s luminaries – and even some Republicans – have grimly warned the public that he represents a fundamental danger to democracy.

“He treats our country like it’s his family business,” warned former Assistant Attorney General Sally Yates. “America, Donald Trump has quit on you,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. Even senior leaders like Michelle Obama and Bill Clinton devoted chunks of their speeches to warning that the president is a fundamental threat to the country.

Usually conventions feature stinging put-downs of the rival standard-bearer and the occasional lacerating speech. But the 2020 Democratic convention is notable for the consistency of dire warnings about the other party’s leader.

KEYNOTE BY COMMITTEE

Conventions usually follow a standard ritual. But it’s not surprising that a virtual convention would change that.

Biden’s campaign used the moment not to anoint a single emerging party star, but rather 17 of them, reflecting the diversity of race, age, geography and identity.

It was a stunt for sure, with selfies, ring lights and tightly scripted hits on Trump. But it also seemed effective to make the point, that Biden, 77, wants to provide a gateway for young leaders.

“A new generation of leaders is rising up,” said Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, an openly gay lawmaker who praised Biden for supporting marriage equality earlier than many older politicians.

Kenyatta and 15 other speakers led up to Stacey Abrams, the 46-year-old Georgian who in 2018 narrowly missed becoming the first Black woman elected governor of a U.S. state. Abrams also was among the 11 women that Biden interviewed as finalists for his running mate.

The keynote was bookended Monday by a lineup of the Democratic old guard, led by Kerry and two former presidents, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.

Biden has made clear he’s casting a wide net in November. The convention’s first night was mostly showcasing ideological diversity. The keynote and the rest of Tuesday showcased what Biden hopes is generational diversity in his coalition.

CLINTON, BRIEF FOR ONCE, HAMMERS TRUMP

Bill Clinton has now spoken at 11 Democratic national conventions. But he’s never had a more tentative grasp on the party, or a tighter window, than he had Tuesday.

That Clinton was speaking at all was mildly surprising given how his sexual dalliances appear to some in the post-MeToo era. But the notoriously prolix president – whose 2012 speech for Barack Obama ran nearly 50 minutes – was kept to five minutes during the tight, all-online convention. And he wasted no time scorching the man who defeated his wife in the 2016 election.

“If you want a president who spends his day watching hours of TV or zapping people on social media, he’s your man,” Clinton said of Trump in his pre-recorded speech. He slammed Trump for making the Oval Office “the storm centre” rather than “the command centre” during the pandemic, and for the nation’s dismal track record fighting the disease.

For once, Clinton showed that less was more.

LATINO SNUB? ‘TWITTER IS NOT REAL LIFE’

Every convention has an off-script moment, and for Democrats this week, that came when Twitter was aflutter over the snubbing of Julian Castro, who gave the Democrats’ keynote address in 2012 and challenged Biden, sometimes quite personally, in the primaries this year.

The criticism was that Biden was taking the Latino vote for granted. The actual roster of speakers says otherwise.

A famous Latina actress, Eva Longoria Baston, hosted the first night of the convention, which also featured a cameo by labour icon Dolores Huerta, remarks by Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and a breakout speech from Kristin Urquiza, an Arizona Latina who told the story of her father’s death from COVID-19 with the memorable line, “His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump.”

On Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez gave the official nominating speech for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid, and the party’s “rising stars” keynote mash-up of 17 young Democrats featured Hispanic Democrats from California, Nevada and Texas.

The Biden campaign’s mantra during the primary was that “Twitter is not real life.”

Story continues below advertisement

So far it’s been notable that the convention’s main critique of Trump has been over his handling of the pandemic. It’s the biggest issue affecting people right now, but it’s also a disease disproportionately sickening Latinos, who routinely list health care, rather than immigration, as their top priority. That focus may have more of an impact than the speaking list."

U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said a massive shift to mail-in voting in the November presidential election could cause so many problems officials might have to redo the vote.

Trump has said repeatedly and without evidence that a shift to universal mail-in voting – something most states have not proposed doing – will lead to fraud in the Nov. 3 election, when he faces Democratic challenger Joe Biden who currently holds a substantial lead in public opinion polls.

Trump does not have the authority to reschedule an election. A national election “redo” has never occurred in the more than 200 years the U.S. has held elections, including during the Civil War, the Great Depression and two world wars.

“It will end up being a rigged election or they will never come out with an outcome,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday. “They’ll have to do it again, and nobody wants that.”

As much as half the ballots in the November election could be cast by mail due to America’s coronavirus crisis, election experts say. That is up from about one in four ballots that were cast by mail in 2016.

Trump himself votes by mail.

As with other forms of voting, documented cases of mail-ballot fraud are extremely rare. But Trump on Tuesday repeated an allegation he has made in recent months that mail-in voting will lead to massive ballot fraud.

U.S. states run presidential elections and most only plan to mail absentee ballots for November’s election to voters who request them.

A handful of states regularly hold elections with what is known as universal mail-in voting, in which every voter receives a ballot by mail. A few other states, including California and Nevada, plan to mail ballots to all voters for the November election due to the health crisis.

“Absentee is great but universal is going to be a disaster,” Trump said.

The latest flashpoint in a country that has politicized almost everything – wearing masks, the number of people who can crowd around the polished metal bar in the neighbourhood pub, whether college football teams play their fall schedules – is perhaps the most prosaic function of government.

And so it was almost inevitable in the Donald Trump years that the local American post office – founded by Benjamin Franklin, revered as a village gathering place, dreaded by criminals pictured on “most-wanted” posters, defended even by those who revile Washington as perhaps the only essential domestic function of central government – has become the most controversial place in the United States.

But there it stands – the brick building with the white trim and the musty smell inside, on Main Streets from coast to coast – as a 2020 election battleground.

Like the post office itself, the contretemps is simply described. The pandemic has made lines at polling stations into a threat to public health. Democrats, who hope a big turnout will elect Joe Biden, support massive mail voting. Mr. Trump sees peril in near-effortless voting and seeks to curtail postal services by limiting funding, prompting mail delays and undermining perhaps the most favoured institution in American life. Indeed, according to the Pew Research Center, the United States Postal Service has a 91-per-cent approval rating – higher than Congress, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and twice Mr. Trump’s own.

This month the President, who for months has sowed distrust in the postal service, opposed US$25-billion in emergency funding and a separate, supplemental US$3.5-billion to handle a flood of mail ballots. The House of Representatives will hold a special session Saturday to approve funding to assure the postal service can redeem its revered motto that “neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.”

The rush to register for postal ballots is real. In tiny Conway, N.H., population 10,266, the town clerk is getting 30 to 50 applications a day. Already North Carolina officials have received 163,374 applications for mail ballots – seven times the 2016 requests. Ballot-drop boxes to bypass the post office are sprouting on the landscape.

And Monday night, Eva Longoria, the moderator of the virtual Democratic National Convention, made postal voting a prominent theme, with Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto describing it as “a secure, proven” voting method employed by Mr. Trump himself. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota complained the President’s actions meant “seniors won’t be able to get their [mail] prescriptions because he wants to win an election.”

The controversy is less about the USPS’s capacity to handle a ballot flood than about operational changes – overtime, work rules – being implemented by Mr. Trump’s appointees that could affect the processing and delivery of mail ballots, and that already are leaving mail in depots for days. On Tuesday, under heavy pressure from state attorneys-general, Democratic lawmakers and the public, Postmaster-General Louis DeJoy announced the suspension of changes until after the election. It did little to quell the furor.

This post office controversy is not only about the present threat of Trump voter suppression nor about the future of the mail in an era of texts, e-mails and Amazon deliveries. It is also about the past.

No institution is so embedded in American culture as the post office – and no art form is so esteemed in American life as the letter.

William Hill Brown’s 1789 book, The Power of Sympathy, structured as a series of letters, is considered the first American novel. (It was preceded by 20 years by the first Canadian novel, The History of Emily Montague, also an epistolary work.) The horse-mounted 19th-century mail carriers of the Pony Express may have operated for 18 months but they remain a well-loved element of American folklore.

The American Revolution was foreshadowed by the publication of Letters from a Pennsylvania Farmer. The French-born J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur, later a Canadian cartographer who served with Louis Montcalm and was wounded in the 1759 Battle of Quebec, introduced the new American character to Europeans through essays he published in 1782 called Letters from an American Farmer. Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1963 civil-rights manifesto was called the “Letter from the Birmingham Central Jail.” Richard Nixon’s resignation from the presidency came in a letter. It was a single sentence of 11 words.

And perhaps the most poignant American letter came from Major Sullivan Ballou, a Union soldier wounded and dying during an 1861 Civil War battle, addressed to his soon-to-be-widowed 24-year-old wife: “If there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath; or the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.”

Mr. Trump’s offensive against the post office has erased its mystique. In the coming week, the House oversight and reform committee will question Mr. DeJoy and USPS board chair Robert Duncan; Mr. DeJoy will face the Senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee in a separate hearing. Democratic Representatives Ted Lieu of California and Hakeem Jeffries of New York of the House judiciary committee this week called for an FBI criminal investigation into Mr. DeJoy over nationwide USPS delays.

And yet the mail – especially in a time of pandemic – endures as a public necessity as well as a symbol of romance.

Shakespeare’s double-death 1597 tragedy of Romeo and Juliet was the result of the very sort of failure of mail delivery Democrats fear in 2020. Friar Lawrence’s letter about the plan to salvage the fate of the famous lovers never arrived. The letter carrier was quarantined, having been “visiting the sick … in a house /Where the pestilence did reign.”

The new illness that emerged last December in China – officially called COVID-19, previously known as 2019-nCoV – is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Corona means “crown” or “halo” in Latin, describing the viruses’ typical shape when seen under an electron microscope. The common cold is a type of coronaviral illness, but it tends to cause nasal congestion, which COVID-19 doesn’t always do. COVID-19′s symptoms (dry coughing, fever and aches) resemble more serious and dangerous coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS. Initially the symptoms can also look like flu, which is caused by a different virus type, but don’t let the similarity fool you: COVID-19 is far more dangerous (more on that below).

Human coronaviruses most commonly spread from an infected person to others through: The air by coughing and sneezing Close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands Touching the eyes, nose or mouth after touching an infected surface Rarely, fecal contamination WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF THE VIRUS? Headache Dry cough Fever In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death SOME FACTS ABOUT THE VIRUS Belongs to large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS and SARS Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people There are no specific treatments for coronaviruses, but symptoms can be treated MURAT YÜKSELIR / THE GLOBE AND MAIL, SOURCE: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Health Canada, WHO Human coronaviruses most commonly spread from an infected person to others through: The air by coughing and sneezing Close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands Touching the eyes, nose or mouth after touching an infected surface Rarely, fecal contamination WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF THE VIRUS?

How COVID-19 CAN KILL YOU

COVID-19′s death rate varies considerably from country to country and among age groups, but even conservative estimates put it tens of times higher than seasonal influenza (0.1 per cent), though generally lower than SARS (10 per cent). The graphics below offer a step-by-step explanation of COVID-19′s lethal effects on the body in severe cases.

VIRUS The virus enters the lungs and attaches itself to cells which make up the lungs’ protective lining. CELLS RNA RECEPTOR VIRUS Once attached to a cell’s receptor, the virus injects its RNA into the cell, providing it with the blueprint to build copies of the virus. IMMUNE CELL INFECTED DEAD The infected cell eventually self-destructs, releasing the virus to infect neighbouring cells. Exponential growth in infected cells triggers an excessive response by the immune system. Immune cells sent to fight the virus begin to destroy both infected and healthy cells. ALVEOLI BACTERIA BACTERIAL INFECTION If enough of the protective lining is destroyed, it leaves the alveoli – the tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs – vulnerable to bacterial infection. This can lead to severe respiratory problems, making mechanical ventilation necessary to help the patient survive. The immune system can become overwhelmed while the bacteria multiply. If bacteria enter the blood, they can overrun the body and cause death.

Transmission

Though SARS had a higher death rate than COVID-19, it infected and killed far fewer people (8,098 infections and 774 deaths worldwide, according to the U.S. CDC’s estimates). One possible reason for this is that unlike SARS, whose carriers generally knew they were sick, the new coronavirus is transmissible before symptoms develop. On average, it takes about five days for people infected with COVID-19 to show symptoms, according to a U.S.-based team’s estimates published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. SARS’s incubation period was longer, about 10 days.

Testing

Health officials in Canada and other countries have a test to make sure whether a patient has COVID-19 or some other illness. Depending on where you live in Canada, these may be available either at dedicated clinics or in at-home visits from health officials. If you start showing the symptoms of COVID-19, contact your local health authority or family doctor and do as they advise.

Physical distancing

Various governments have introduced new limits on public assembly and events since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in mid-March.

Public gatherings: Provincial governments have used state-of-emergency powers to limit public assemblies to just a few people, and will use fines or other penalties to enforce that. Check our guide of the rules by province and territory to see what it’s like near you.

Essential businesses: Most provinces issued lists of businesses deemed “essential” and barred others from operating, except as work-from-home or e-commerce operations. Since June, a lot of the closed businesses have reopened under stricter rules for physical distancing.

Schools: Most provincial governments have closed their K-12 public school systems, though Quebec’s and B.C.‘s have reopened in limited form. High schools, junior colleges and universities have moved to e-learning and many are not planning to reopen until September.

Travel restrictions

International travel: The United States and Canada suspended non-essential border traffic, except for essential supply chains, on March 20. Canada had already barred most non-American foreign nationals from entering and restricted international air travel to the airports in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal. Canadians abroad are urged to come home and self-isolate for 14 days, but only if they’re asymptomatic: Airlines will refuse passage to anyone showing COVID-19 symptoms.

Interprovincial and intercity travel: Getting on a train, plane or bus has been an increasingly complicated process across Canada, and masks may be mandatory if you’re using one of those. Some provinces and territories closed their borders, and have reopened them only selectively, such as the “Atlantic bubble” that will allow free movement among Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick starting July 3.

Federal economic relief

Since mid-March, the Trudeau government’s stimulus measures have grown to tens of billions worth of direct supports and tax deferrals, which Ottawa has continued to add to or extend. The measures include:

Canada Emergency Relief Benefit: A $2,000-a-month, 16-week emergency benefit to pay workers whose income drops to zero, even if they have been furloughed by employers but technically still have jobs.

The shifting epicentres

Since the virus emerged last year, three countries – China, then Italy, then the United States – have taken turns as the most infected ones on the planet. Here’s how their governments have responded.

China

Last December, authorities in Hubei province initially dismissed warnings of a new virus, and even punished the Wuhan ophthalmologist who tried to sound the alarm. But within weeks, when the outbreak was spreading fast, China put millions of people in Wuhan and its environs under near-total quarantine, just as the Lunar New Year travel season was getting under way. Chinese lawmakers also banned the trade and consumption of wild animal meat, the suspected source of the virus. As the quarantines brought China’s economy to a standstill, local governments faced conflicting demands to bring people back to work but still prevent the spread of COVID-19. In March, after the number of new Chinese cases levelled off, travel restrictions began to lift. Since then, China’s focus has been on preventing the reintroduction of COVID-19 from other countries, leading in some cases to discrimination and violence against foreigners.

Italy

COVID-19 hit northern Italy’s Lombardy region fast and hard in February after hospital staff failed to isolate a super-carrier who visited them several times. Soon, Italy had hundreds of cases, then thousands, and many countries across Europe and Africa traced their first COVID-19 cases back to the Italian epidemic. After local quarantines and the closing of schools and universities failed to stop the virus’s spread, by early March, the Italian government put Lombardy under a total lockdown – measures that were soon extended nationwide, affecting 62 million Italians. The quarantine required most Italians to stay home, prohibited public assembly and non-essential travel and closed pools, theatres and sporting events. Additional measures announced on March 11 also closed all stores except groceries and pharmacies. Soon, Spain, France and the Czech Republic instituted Italian-style quarantine measures. Italy’s lockdown began to ease in May, and since June travel within Europe has slowly reopened.

United States

Through February and early March, U.S. President Donald Trump, who is up for re-election later this year, generally told Americans that they were not at great risk from COVID-19 and economic activities should go on as normal. He also contradicted public health officials on everything from the virus’s fatality rate to the risks posed by workers who come in sick. Meanwhile, U.S. health officials performed far fewer tests than other jurisdictions, including Canada. Under mounting pressure to act, Mr. Trump declared a national state of emergency in mid-March and prodded Congress to pass three relief packages worth trillions of dollars. But by the end of April, when his home state of New York remained the worst-affected in the country, Mr. Trump allowed federal lockdown recommendations to lapse. Since then, he and his supporters put state governments under mounting pressure to reopen quickly, even as cases began to surge again in June thanks to new outbreaks in different states.

How do I ‘flatten the curve’?

When diseases reach uninfected populations, a graph of the new infections will generally follow a curve: Infections rise, then peak, then fall. You’ll see a lot of officials talk about “flattening the curve,” or preventing the peak infections from exceeding their health systems’ ability to handle them. A big part of this is physical distancing: Avoiding public gatherings, staying home from work or school and changing social habits, like waving instead of shaking hands. If front-line health workers are spared from a sudden and overwhelming increase in new cases, lives will be saved. And when the pandemic is over, those workers will be better-equipped to act once there’s a vaccine available for the new disease, like the one researchers are racing to develop for COVID-19.

HOW TO ISOLATE AT HOME WHEN YOU HAVE COVID-19 Isolation means staying at home when you are sick with COVID-19 and avoiding contact with other people to help prevent the spread of disease to others in your home and your community. If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, it is expected that you take the following measures. AVOID CONTAMINATING COMMON ITEMS AND SURFACES At least once daily, clean and disinfect surfaces that you touch often, like toilets, bedside tables, doorknobs, phones and television remotes. Do not share personal items with others, such as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic devices. CARE FOR YOURSELF Monitor your symptoms as directed by your health-care provider or Public Health Authority. If your symptoms get worse, immediately contact your health-care provider or Public Health Authority and follow their instructions. LIMIT CONTACT WITH OTHERS Do not leave home unless absolutely necessary, such as to seek medical care. Do not go to school, work, other public areas or use public transportation (e.g. buses, taxis). Arrange to have groceries and supplies dropped off at your door to minimize contact. KEEP YOUR HANDS CLEAN Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and dry with disposable paper towels or dry reusable towel, replacing it when it becomes wet.

Stay at home: The country’s top public health officials have urged Canadians to avoid going out unless necessary for grocery runs, exercise or medical emergencies, but the relaxation of local states of emergency has given people a wider range of activities. But if you’ve got COVID-19 symptoms like dry coughing, fever or difficulty breathing, or have been in contact with someone showing those symptoms, self-isolation for 14 days is crucial.

The province is at Level 2 of its five-level alert system, which increased the gathering limit, reopened more public facilities and allowed more free movement within the province. Level 1 will be as close to a “new normal” as possible until a vaccine or effective treatment for COVID-19 is found.

Public gatherings: Restricted to 50 or fewer people outdoors or at functions like weddings and funerals. Two individual households are allowed to form exclusive “double bubbles” to gather together in person, and each bubble can invite up to six others from different households to join, as long as they’re not exceeding the limits for their own bubbles by doing so.

Since June, most businesses and community activities have been reopened with physical distancing in place, and since the start of July, the Atlantic bubble allows Nova Scotians to more freely travel within the region.

Public gatherings: Events like weddings, funerals, festivals and concerts can have up to 250 people outdoors and 200 (maximum half-capacity) indoors, and family gatherings can have up to 50. Physical distancing is required. But Nova Scotians are also allowed to form 10-person circles that can meet without physical distancing.

All health regions of New Brunswick are currently in “yellow” mode, the second-lowest of four colour-coded stages in its recovery plan. The lowest stage, green, won’t be reached until there is a COVID-19 vaccine or another effective method for preventing the virus’s spread.

Public gatherings: Restricted to 10 or fewer people, with the limit for outdoor gatherings in most of New Brunswick due to increase to 50 in June. One household is allowed to “bubble” with one other household.

Quebec

Montreal reopened at a much slower pace than the rest of Quebec, but relaxation measures in June brought them a little closer together: Restaurants can now have dine-in service provincewide, and gyms, arenas, concert venues and movie theatres can open too.

Public gatherings: Limited to 50 people outdoors and 10 indoors, with no more than three households at any one indoor gathering. Some indoor venues like restaurants and theatres can have 50 people at a time if physical distancing is in place. Children under 16 are also able to interact at a closer distance than adults: One metre instead of two.

Ontario

As of July 31, all of Ontario’s health regions except Windsor-Essex are at Stage 3 of the reopening plan. Stage 3 still prohibits overnight camping, saunas, dancing at restaurants and bars and table games at casinos.

Public gatherings: In most of the 34 health regions, gatherings of 50 inside and 100 outside are allowed as of July 17, as long as physical distancing is observed. That doesn’t include the Windsor-Essex area, where the Stage 2 limits of 10 people (indoors or outdoors) still apply. Ontarians can also form “social circles” of up to 10 people that they can visit freely, but are discouraged from joining more than one circle at a time.

Saskatchewan was the first province to set specific dates for reopening its economy, a five-stage process that is now in Phase 4.2. Indoor pools, indoor sports and casinos are due to reopen in the next stage of the plan. Details are scarce about what Phase 5 would look like, but the province might consider lifting limits on public gatherings.

Public gatherings: Restricted to 30 indoors and outdoors, with exceptions for church services, weddings and funerals (up to 150 people or a third of the venue’s capacity, whichever is less) and graduations (30 graduates and an overall attendance of 150).

Since June 12, the territory has been in Phase 2 of a four-phase plan. The implementation of the next phase depends on when the rest of Canada clears a second wave of infections, which could come between August and October. The final phase would lift all restrictions, but only if there is a vaccine or an effective treatment accessible within the territory.

Public gatherings: Outdoor gatherings of up to 25 indoors and 50 outdoors are allowed with physical distancing, but at home, Northwest Territories residents can have only five people over, to a maximum of 10.

In less than a month, millions of kids will return to school. What do parents need to know?



Join André Picard and Nicole MacIntyre for a live Q&A on Aug. 19

Ontario school boards can stagger the first two weeks of children returning to classroom, the government says, as the Toronto District School Board looks at unused spaces for classrooms and targets more resources for schools in areas with high rates of COVID-19.

In a memo to school boards Tuesday, Education Minister Stephen Lecce said some boards had requested to stagger reopening beyond the first week of school, adding that the “foremost priority is the health and safety of students and staff in the reopening process.”

Trustees at the TDSB were looking at several options on reopening on Tuesday evening. Carlene Jackson, the TDSB’s interim director, also confirmed that the board was given the “green light” on a new secondary school model. It sees students doing a combination of live, synchronous online learning and independent work at home, with about 40 per cent of their time spent in classrooms.

High-school students learning in-person will be in classrooms for the first half of every second day, break between 12:30 p.m. and 2 p.m., and follow the remainder of their lessons online at home.

Jim Spyropoulos, the TDSB’s executive superintendent, said the board still needs to finalize what will happen over the midday period aside from students travelling back home.

“I don’t want to leave people with an idea that teachers are going to be sitting on a lunch break from 12:30 to 2:00, that’s not going to happen,” Mr. Spyropoulos said.

In less than a month, millions of kids will return to school. Here’s what parents need to know

Teachers could use the time to provide additional help to students, contact families whose children have been missing class, co-ordinate with colleagues about lessons and more, he explained.

“We still need to finalize some of those details.”

The TDSB and other large urban boards in Ontario were sent back to the drawing board late last week after the province rejected their plans for in-person elementary and secondary school instruction. The TDSB’s previous high-school schedule had students in classrooms for 25 per cent of the time. Mr. Lecce recently said he wanted high-school students in class for about 50 per cent of the time.

The board, the country’s largest, also planned to shorten elementary school days by 48 minutes, a move that would have kept classes between 15 and 20 students while ensuring teachers maintain their daily 48 minutes of preparation time.

The government is now asking teachers to be flexible with their prep time, typically used to grade assignments, prepare lessons or conduct research – a request the province says teacher unions refuse to discuss. The unions have said the government is attempting to shift blame amid growing unrest among parents and educators about last-minute changes to reopening plans.

TDSB trustees also revealed data from their parent pre-registration survey, to which 67 per cent of parents responded. At the elementary level, 29 per cent of parents said they would keep their children at home if class sizes remained the same. If they were reduced, 23 per cent of parents would be doing the same.

Some 17 per cent of parents with high-school students in the TDSB system have opted for full-remote learning.

This summer, experts from Toronto’s SickKids Hospital and the Public Health Agency of Canada both emphasized that smaller class sizes were crucial to maintaining physical distancing among children, and helping limit the spread of COVID-19. However, the task has proven difficult across the country, with provinces such as Alberta and Ontario not mandating smaller class sizes.

Children – who have been out of schools since March – and their parents are now trying to make the difficult decision of either pursuing education remotely or returning to school buildings amid warnings of a second wave of the virus.

Ontario’s Ministry of Education had earmarked $309-million for the purchase of masks and other personal protective equipment, cleaning, and the hiring of public-health nurses in school boards across the province. It had also committed $50-million for heating, ventilation and air conditioning upgrades in schools, and has designated $30-million for the hiring of additional teachers and assistants.

Last week, Mr. Lecce also announced school boards could use their reserve funds to cover additional hiring costs, but boards have said that it won’t be nearly enough to lower all class sizes at the elementary level.

Several boards, including the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board (OCDSB) and the Halton District School Board (HDSB), have been scrambling to rework timetables as the government changed direction with just weeks before school starts.

Andréa Grebenc, chair of the Halton District School Board, said that her board, like others, presented their plans to the Ministry of Education in late July and there were no concerns expressed at that time.

“Boards are now back at square one with classes beginning in exactly three weeks,” said Andréa Grebenc, chair of the HDSB. “It is time for the Minister to start truly listening and collaborating with school boards as education partners instead of making intermittent proclamations that just sow chaos.”

The board, she said, had to pause its survey of how many students are returning to the classroom after Mr. Lecce changed direction.

The OCDSB said the changes from Mr. Lecce came three days before its survey of families was set to close.

“We understand that the upcoming adjustments to the return to school plan may result in a change of decision for some families,” director of education Camille Williams-Taylor wrote in an e-mail to parents last week. “We will establish a process to allow families to make a change. However, timelines are tight and we need to do as much forward planning as possible.”

Earlier this week, the Ottawa board said that about 26.9 per cent of its elementary students opted for remote learning, while 21.5 per cent of secondary school students did the same.

Other boards are seeing similar results. The York Region District School Board said 33 per cent of elementary school families opted for learning online, and 20 per cent of high-school students made that choice. The Durham District School Board said about 20 per cent of its elementary and high-school students chose remote learning.

Victim after victim lined up on Tuesday to describe Joseph DeAngelo as a “sick monster,” “horrible man” and “subhuman” who stole their innocence and changed their lives during a more than decade-long reign of rape and murder that earned him the nickname Golden State Killer.

The daughter of one rape victim gave him an obscene hand gesture and cursed him during the first of four days of hearings in Sacramento County Superior Court before he is formally sentenced to life in prison on Friday under a plea agreement that allows DeAngelo to avoid a death sentence.

Some read statements on behalf of their loved ones who could not testify in person, while others proudly gave their names now that DeAngelo, 74, is heading to prison.

“He and his knife had complete control over me for the next two hours,” Patti Cosper, the daughter of rape survivor Patricia Murphy, read from her mother’s statement. “He truly is an evil monster with no soul.”

DeAngelo is a former police officer in California who eluded capture for four decades. He was identified and arrested in 2018 by using a new form of DNA tracing.

Nearly two-dozen of his Sacramento County rape victims or their family members confronted him in the courthouse that is otherwise still sealed from the public because of the coronavirus. Others planned to tell Superior Court Judge Michael Bowman on Wednesday and Thursday how DeAngelo’s crimes changed their lives.

“I was a normal 15-year-old kid. I loved going to school, having sleepovers and going to church,” Kris Pedretti told the judge. “My world was small, predictable and safe.”

Then DeAngelo attacked her just before Christmas in 1976.

“I sang ‘Jesus Loves Me’ in my head as I waited – waited to die,” Pedretti said. “The knowledge that DeAngelo will spend the rest of his life in prison for his heinous acts has ended my dark journey so that I may begin a new one.”

Lisa Lilienthal described DeAngelo as a sadistic “boogeyman” as she testified by video about the attack she witnessed on her mother. Until his arrest, she said, “something lingered in the shadows – our sense of normalcy, our sense of safety had been raped too.”

In June, DeAngelo pleaded guilty to 13 murders and 13 rape-related charges between 1975 and 1986. He also publicly admitted dozens more sexual assaults for which the statute of limitations had expired.

All told, he admitted harming 87 victims at 53 separate crime scenes spanning 11 California counties in the plea deal that spares him the death penalty, prosecutors said.

That’s more victims than prosecutors disclosed after his admission in June to 161 crimes involving 48 people. The higher number includes those who chose not to participate in having DeAngelo publicly admit to crimes in which he could not be formally charged, Ventura County District Attorney Greg Totten said.

DeAngelo’s nicknames showed the escalation and geographic sweep of his crimes: the Visalia Ransacker, thought to be responsible for about 100 burglaries and one slaying in the San Joaquin Valley farm town; the East Area Rapist; the Original Night Stalker; and finally, the Golden State Killer when investigators finally linked the crimes that stretched across much of the state.

The family of Debbie Strauss, who died in 2016, recounted what became the signature that marked DeAngelo’s crimes after he escalated his attacks to couples instead of single women and girls.

He would force his victims to bind themselves with shoelaces before balancing plates on the man’s back with a warning that he would kill both victims if he heard the plates rattle while he raped the woman.

“He spent hours raining his terror through threats and unspeakable abuse,” said Strauss’ mother, Dolly Kreis. “He would leave his victims shaking in fright while he went to the kitchen to eat, only to return and then the abuse and vileness started all over again.”

Sandy James, Strauss’ sister, was among the many speakers who repeatedly tried to rattle DeAngelo by bringing up what they said was his small penis, a description that numerous victims gave investigators when they reported the rapes.

The killer, however, sat silently in an orange jail jumpsuit, staring straight ahead and wearing a mask as protection against the coronavirus.

Some said they believed his day of reckoning would never come.

Among them were two sisters who took turns testifying. Peggy was 15 when she was raped, and Sue was 16 when she was bound and gagged in another room. Neither gave their last names as they described the trauma that still haunts their otherwise successful lives.

“My God, we were just high school kids,” Peggy said, noting that she was stunned when DeAngelo was arrested.

“Finally the end of this trauma is here,” Peggy added. “He’s a horrible man and none of us have to worry about him any more.”"

Premier Doug Ford says Ontario teachers’ unions are “playing politics” by opposing his government’s back-to-school plan.

Ford says the plan to reopen schools next month was designed with input from health experts.

His comments come as officials with the Toronto District School Board meet to redraw their reopening plan after the province rejected their proposal to cut class sized by shortening the school day.

Canada’s back-to-school plans: The latest news, and resources on COVID-19 and your kids

Along with the teachers’ unions, some parents and school boards have expressed concern about the government plan, which does not cut elementary school class sizes.

In response to those concerns, the province said boards can access $500 million of their own savings to achieve physical distancing in classrooms.

Meanwhile, Ontario is reporting 125 new cases of COVID-19 and four new deaths related to the virus.

The total number of cases now stands at 40,870, which includes 2,793 deaths and 37,126 cases marked as resolved.

Health Minister Christine Elliott says the “uptick” in cases is due to increases in Peel Region, Toronto and Windsor-Essex. She said 27 of Ontario’s 34 public health regions reported five or fewer cases, while 16 reported no new cases.

The province was able to complete 23,067 tests in the previous day.

The hundreds of millions in developer “contributions” that the City of Vancouver has relied on for years to pay for housing, parks and child-care centres has dried to a trickle as builders refuse to agree to the same levels of fees in a collapsing real-estate market.

Builders say they have not been able to move projects forward because the city is still asking for the same kinds of contributions that were being negotiated at the height of the market.

That flow of money, which depends on leveraging Vancouver’s valuable real estate by allowing more density on key sites in exchange for developer payments out of their increased profit to pay for needed community services, has dried up in the past 18 months.

Story continues below advertisement

It dropped from $706-million in 2018 to $86-million in 2019 and a dribble so far in 2020, according to city reports and industry analysts. That includes both cash and in-kind contributions, such as social-housing units or child-care spaces that are included in a project and then turned over to the city.

What is still being collected is coming from projects where the community-amenity contribution, or CAC, is a non-negotiable amount for that area. Missing are the larger contributions that typically come from big, complex condo projects, usually downtown, where the price per square foot is set after complex calculations about the project’s finances.

As well, some developers who had contribution agreements prior to 2019 are putting those projects on hold.

The last major project with an agreed-upon community-amenity contribution, a condo tower in Coal Harbour, had its CAC set at $325 a square foot at the end of 2018. Another one near BC Place stadium was set at $315 in that pre-2019 period.

Builders say the city is continuing to ask for the same levels of contributions as it was getting in 2018, even though the market has slowed significantly. As well, the province has layered new taxes onto expensive or “speculator” homes, which is putting more downward pressure on prices.

“The city has said ‘We think you can sell for more than you’re saying.’ We say that isn’t working,” said Anne McMullin, the CEO of the Urban Development Institute, which represents most of the large developers in the region.

But the city’s head planner, Gil Kelley, said the city has to find a way to pay for growth in the city and it can’t function by just reducing or eliminating those amenity contributions in slow markets.

“We are really trying to protect the public’s interest to make sure new growth pays it share,” Mr. Kelley said.

As well, he said, the current council has made it clear it wants more housing affordability – therefore more of a contribution from developers – in every project, not the same or less.

But the tussle over what to do about Vancouver’s real estate golden goose has produced a near standoff between city staff and many developers.

Reliance Properties Ltd. CEO Jon Stovell said he has had a project on hold for a year as his team and the city’s real estate department, the group that assesses how much a developer should have to “contribute” back if its project gets rezoned to allow a lot more building on the site, can’t agree on an amount.

Mr. Kelley, who has the final say on staff recommendations about what CAC should be charged for a project, said Monday the city has just issued this week some new guidelines on how community-amenity contributions should be calculated to provide more transparency and certainty.

And he said the city is willing to consider some new approaches, recognizing that no one has a real handle on what condo prices are these days because there are so few sales.

One would be to reduce the required contribution from previous high levels, as long as that builder committed to starting construction within a certain period. “We don’t want to negotiate lower CACs than we did in 2018 and then not have them build for seven or eight years,” Mr. Kelley said.

Another option is to set a high CAC, based on the sales price city staff claim that builders will get, but delay the payment until the project has enough sales at high prices to go ahead.

The bigger conundrum facing Vancouver, Mr. Kelley said, is that many developers are switching their projects for the foreseeable future from condos, which they’re having a hard time selling, to rentals, which Vancouver never seems to have enough of. Rental-project developers typically pay much lower or no CACs at all.

Richard Gwyn was one of Canada’s most influential political journalists of the past 60 years. He worked at a number of outlets, from the old news agency UPI to Time Canada, but he was best known for his political and foreign affairs columns in the Toronto Star. Mr. Gwyn, who died on Aug. 15 at the age of 86, was also the author of seven books, including a two-volume history of Sir John A. Macdonald and The Northern Magus, a portrayal of the enigmatic prime minister Pierre Trudeau.

Most of all, he was a reporter, a man who never gave up on a story and often embarrassed his peers by beating them to a scoop. His first big exclusive came in 1958 when he was working in Ottawa for UPI.

“Gwyn scored a world exclusive that Princess Margaret, then 27, had asked that John Turner, a 29-year-old Montreal bachelor, be added to the guest list for an official ball in Vancouver in the summer of 1958, where they danced the night away,” said Bob Lewis, former editor of Maclean’s, who interviewed Mr. Gwyn for his book Power, Prime Ministers and the Press: The Battle for Truth on Parliament Hill.

“Richard was the journalist you wanted to be,” Mr. Lewis said. “You could never stay ahead of the guy.”

Mr. Gwyn, who became such a part of Canada’s political commentariat, was an alumnus of a British public school. He had one of those hyphenated surnames and never quite lost his English accent, though he did drop the hyphen once he landed in Canada.

Richard John Philip Jermy-Gwyn was born on May 26, 1934, in Bury St. Edmunds, a picture-book English town 130 kilometres northeast of London. He was the son of Brigadier Philip Jermy-Gwyn, an army officer who served in India, and the former Elizabeth Edith Tilley. Young Richard went to Stonyhurst, a private Jesuit school for the Anglo-Catholic elite. He remained a Catholic all his life.

He next went to Sandhurst, the British military school, but soon left for Canada. He was 19 and found life in postwar Britain stifling. His first stop was Newfoundland, where he eked out a living selling subscriptions to a Catholic magazine. He then landed a job at a Halifax radio station. On the ferry over, he met Sandra Fraser, the Newfoundland-born woman who became his wife and literary partner.

They went on to become the journalistic power couple of Ottawa, she as a writer and contributing editor for Saturday Night magazine, he as a high-profile columnist for the Toronto Star. Both became officers of the Order of Canada; she won the Governor-General’s Literary Award, and he was nominated for the same honour.

After a stint in Ottawa’s press gallery, Mr. Gwyn went on to be executive assistant for the Liberal minister of communications, Eric Kierans. Two years later, he moved into the civil service under deputy minister Allan Gotlieb. Most people who leave journalism for such jobs never return. But Mr. Gwyn, fortified with insider knowledge of how government worked, returned to work as a journalist, eventually joining the Toronto Star.

When the paper hired Mr. Gwyn for its Ottawa bureau, the managing editor, Martin Goodman, told him: “What we’re looking for from you is a sense of the inside.” He delivered on that. Mr. Gwyn didn’t wait for something to pop up in Question Period or hang around the media scrums. He was out digging, using his contacts with civil servants, politicians and their army of aides.

In 1984, other columnists mused about when an election might be called. He gleaned the date through a careful analysis of inside dope, not guesswork. He knew that prime minister John Turner had flown to London to meet secretly with the Queen, asking her to postpone her visit because he wanted to call an election. “Circle the date September 4 on your calendars,” he wrote in his column. The prime minister’s office denied it all. But when the election was called, it fell on the date Mr. Gwyn had predicted.

In 1985, Mr. Gwyn was posted to England as the Star’s international affairs columnist. He covered everything from the fall of the Berlin Wall to the end of apartheid in South Africa. He returned to Canada in 1992.

Ian Urquhart, a former managing editor of the Toronto Star, said in addition to being a natural journalist, Mr. Gwyn had two great strengths: “He worked in government for five years, so he had insights most of us didn’t have. And he had the perspective of an outsider, coming from England as he did,” Mr. Urquhart said.

That outsider’s point of view applied not only to Mr. Gwyn’s journalism but to his books on Canada. Mr. Urquhart remembers being at a book launch for one of Mr. Gwyn’s volumes on Sir John A. Macdonald when he was chatting with University of Toronto historian Michael Bliss.

“Michael said to me: ‘Richard has put the professional historians of Canada to shame,‘” Mr. Urquhart recalled.

John Honderich, editor and then publisher of the Toronto Star, said above all Mr. Gwyn was a hard-working reporter.

“His genius was to take two giant steps back and analyze the situation. He was incredibly reliable, and he was a great digger. Pundits today do it off the top. Richard always did the work. He was a great reporter,” Mr. Honderich said.

The author Charlotte Gray says Mr. Gwyn was helpful and generous to colleagues.

“At one point, someone plagiarized one of his books, but he thought the novel was so good, he never said anything,” said Ms. Gray, who was Mr. Gwyn’s friend. “He didn’t pass a lot of moral judgments. He was quite amused when Sir John A. Macdonald or Joey Smallwood flirted with scandal. He was a pragmatist and understood what politics requires.”

Mr. Gwyn was also a force on television even though he was not naturally telegenic. He did several programs at TVO, the Ontario public TV network, starting with Realities, a program he did with journalist Robert Fulford. From 1994 he was a regular on Studio 2, the daily current-affairs program on TVO. That was so popular TVO expanded it to a program called Diplomatic Immunity, where he would appear with his fellow panelists, Eric Margolis and Janice Stein.

Steve Paikin said Mr. Gwyn was a natural on television.

“The guy could communicate. He could organize his thoughts well and articulate them well, and he played well with others. He could disagree with somebody else if he was in the midst of a debate without being personal or resorting to ad hominem attacks. That’s what made him so good at what he did,” Mr. Paikin said.

“Richard was a particular kind of guy. He didn’t know about sports, nothing about the Leafs or the Blue Jays, he didn’t golf, and as a result, his passion in life was issues, the country and the world. Policy, thinking, writing and reading were the things that he loved to do, and he could do all of them with the best of them,” Mr. Paikin said.

Mr. Gwyn was modest about his success. He said he was lucky to be born when he was, 11 years before the start of the postwar baby boom.

“The big thing in life is to time your birth. I was just ahead of the baby boomers. You didn’t have to worry about getting jobs. [Today] I would be struggling,” he told Mr. Lewis.

Mr. Gwyn felt he was lucky to come to Canada.

“The Canadian values of tolerance, civility, and decency are precious and are becoming more and more rare the world over,” he wrote in 1997. In one of his last columns in the Toronto Star in 2016, he said: “For some time now, it’s been obvious that Canada is one of the most successful countries in the world.”

Mr. Gwyn stopped writing and appearing on television as he realized he was suffering from dementia. He leaves his wife, Carol Bishop-Gwyn."

Justin Tang/The Canadian Press

In 2005, philosopher Harry Frankfurt wrote a bestseller titled On Bullshit. In a tight 80 pages, the Princeton University professor defines his subject as speech whose goal is persuasion without regard for the truth.

When Finance Minister Bill Morneau suddenly announced his resignation on Monday night, the words he was forced to use – starting with the howler that this was a long-planned, voluntary “resignation” – were of the genus explored by Mr. Frankfurt. As were high-level government leaks, each more Frankfurtian than the last, which over the previous week had been designed to besmirch Mr. Morneau and set the stage for his departure.

Like someone emerging into the light after a long Maoist struggle session, on Monday night Mr. Morneau said that his abrupt leave-taking was, in fact, part of a “plan” he’d had since entering politics. He’d always intended to serve for only two terms. And so, in the middle of an economic crisis on which he was the lead minister, just 10 months after re-election and with the next fixed election date 38 months away, he had to resign. Immediately.

And in any case, leaving would give him time to apply for his real dream job: secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. So, it was time to go. After a hastily called news conference. With Prime Minister Justin Trudeau not in attendance, but tweeting out fulsome praise – all the sincerity of a drugstore condolence card; all the personalization of a form letter – for someone his minions had spent the previous week smearing.

The explanation for Mr. Morneau’s surprise “resignation” is as covered in Frankfurt as Mr. Trudeau’s surprise claim last month, before a House of Commons committee, that when he found out WE Charity was about to be awarded a huge contract, he “pushed back” and demanded more due diligence. If that’s what happened, then why didn’t the PM and the ministers and bureaucrats defending him say a word about it, for weeks? Why was the most exculpatory explanation not the first thing he had to say, but the last?

In the parliamentary system, cabinets get shuffled, and ministers with them. It happens. There’s no reason for there to be anything dishonourable about the business. Mr. Morneau, the only finance minister the Trudeau government has ever known, has been in the job for nearly five years. It was a long run. It was a good run. If the PM felt it was time for a change, a change could have been made with grace.

If the PM believed Mr. Morneau’s oversights on the WE file demanded a resignation, that could have been done, too. Apologize for the error, step down, do time in the penalty box and eventually return to the ice. In the old tradition of ministerial responsibility, that’s how it went. Though, owing to Mr. Trudeau’s similar, bigger WE problem, perhaps that couldn’t be given as the public reason for Mr. Morneau’s removal.

And if this was about making room for Mark Carney – opening up a safe Liberal seat, and the most powerful ministry – then why not just say that? The government could sell it as going from strength to strength. Ditto for moving Chrystia Freeland into Finance.

But that’s not how this went down. Instead, anonymous Liberal sources were dispatched to insinuate that the Trudeau government was Animal Farm, and Mr. Morneau was Snowball. The tale being shopped around last week was that the erstwhile Finance Minister of The Middle Class and Those Working Hard to Join It had secretly been working hard to stick it to hard-working Canadians – and it was only thanks to the PM’s intervention against this Conservative mole in his cabinet that Ottawa’s generous pandemic economic bailout package came to be.

Who comes up with these whoppers? But these off-the-record allegations against Mr. Morneau do serve a purpose, namely aiming to brand the next election as a binary choice between open-the-taps Liberals and cut-now Conservatives. Right-leaning commentators have unwittingly furthered this rebranding, by repeating it as gospel.

However, the trouble with a government smearing its most prominent minister is that, in trying to dirty him, it has mostly soiled itself.

In a Trudeau cabinet of spokesmodels – men and women who dutifully recite whatever script is handed them – Mr. Morneau was one of the few who offered something more. There aren’t many like that in this government, and today there’s one fewer.

“You’re going where? In February? At your age?”

Friends’ voices rang with disbelief when I announced plans for my first-ever solo holiday – a two-and-a-half-week jaunt from balmy Victoria to snowbound Churchill, Man. I listened to dire pronouncements about vicious polar bears, frigid temperatures, shut-down tourist facilities and expensive air-ambulance evacuation.

Story continues below advertisement

Having thoroughly researched my trip, I shared none of these qualms. I explained that polar bears are not skulking around town in February. They are far out on Hudson Bay, hunting seals on the ice. In late winter, the average temperature in Churchill is -20 C, familiar to me after 45 years on the Saskatchewan Prairies. February/March is the aurora borealis season, so services would be open for tourists. Not as many as summertime but, on the plus side, there wouldn’t be black flies or mosquitoes.

“At your age?” There was only one answer to this rebuke: “I won’t be younger next year.” I have embarked on a campaign called “Embracing 80,” doing 80 new things before I reach that venerable age. The occasion of my 78th birthday seemed an ideal time to visit Churchill. And just in case – Churchill has comprehensive hospital facilities.

Besides, this was a research trip. I’m writing a novel about Scottish Highlanders evicted from their land in 1813 and forced to immigrate to the New World. Unforeseen circumstances caused them to spend the winter near the small Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) outpost at the mouth of the Churchill River. Obviously, I needed to experience Churchill in winter to fully imagine their ordeal. This argument convinced my family there was a compelling reason for my madcap adventure, other than incipient dementia.

Before embarking, I showed my walking group my new waterproof hiking boots, guaranteed to protect to -40, Celsius or Fahrenheit. “Those won’t be warm enough,” admonished well-meaning friends recently returned from Mexican beaches. “I’ll wear thick socks,” I countered.

I did feel a twinge of anxiety about being lonely, travelling on my own. That concern was quickly dispelled. From my first phone call to the Churchill Chamber of Commerce, I felt warmly welcomed. When I chatted with Bill, the proprietor of the Iceberg Inn, he promised to arrange personalized tours. In addition, he offered to bake a birthday cake. A woman I met on the plane ride north gave me a scenic tour of the area before dropping me off at my cozy lodge.

After checking in, I donned my borrowed winter gear – snow pants, down-filled coat, fur-lined mitts – and took my first walkabout. My new boots were perfect for crunching over the dry snow that squeaked with every step. That sound reminded me of winter in Saskatchewan. As I strolled down the main street, the wind stung my cheeks. Pulling down my hat flaps, I carried on to the edge of town, about 10 minutes away. The snow-swept flatlands extended to a line of trees far off on the horizon. I felt right at home.

On the way back I stopped at Polar Bears International House, the destination Bill had suggested for my introduction to Churchill. The instant I stepped inside, I was offered tea and cake. The curator and I bonded and spent the next hour play-fighting with polar bear skulls. Did I mention I was the only visitor?

Back at my hostel, Eva, a 25-year-old traveller from Germany, had prepared supper for herself, Bill and me. Did I feel lonely? Not for a second. Eva became my close companion for restaurant meals and strolls about town. The age difference didn’t matter. We recognized the same curiosity and exuberance in each other, and shared the same awe for the barely touched northern terrain. I quickly realized that wilderness outposts like Churchill attract free spirits who think outside mainstream cultural constraints.

I threw myself into each new adventure. With snowshoes on my feet, I sank down mid-calf into fresh snow, as opposed to floundering waist-deep without them. Yes, I could waddle adequately on a hard-packed trail, but I wanted to experience the challenge of travelling through deep drifts. Each foot had to be drawn straight up with bent knee and carefully placed a step ahead. It required mental concentration to teach leg muscles this new way of walking, not to mention these same muscles protesting for several days. Now I have some understanding of the struggles my poor Highlanders faced on their 150-mile snowshoe trek to York Factory.

Bill arranged an excursion across the Churchill River, about two miles wide at its mouth. My guide, Steve, took me in his side-by-side Ski-Doo. He assured me he was a Northern Ranger, so I was safe with him. Focused on the forthcoming adventure, I hadn’t worried for an instant about my welfare. But just in case, the rifle slung on his back instilled confidence. Near both shores ice ridges erupted from the frozen surface like grotesque sea monsters. I yelled “Stop!” several times to take photos.

On the far shore, Steve took me wherever I wanted to go. The first stop was Sloop’s Cove, an extended area of flat rocks where various HBC employees from the past had carved their names. This was where my characters had been dumped off their ship, instead of at York Factory where accommodation awaited them. At the ruins of Fort Prince of Wales the only other footprints had been made by an Arctic hare. Another advantage of the off-season – I fully experienced the isolation of the desolate, treeless tundra.

When the wind was still, the silence of the snow-shrouded tundra was overpowering. There was no sound except my own breathing. If I moved, I heard my footfall on the creaking snow. On the frozen water near shore, I heard ominous groaning as the ice shifted with the flowing tide. At night, the Northern Lights evoked body-tingling awe no photograph could duplicate. These memories will enliven winter-survival scenes in my novel.

The railway station is a two-minute walk from the Iceberg Inn. During my birthday dinner, two French guests started getting restless about missing their 7 p.m. boarding time. At 6:45 p.m., Bill and Eva were just lighting candles for the cake. Well, who should emerge from one of the bedrooms but the train engineer after an afternoon nap. Problem solved. We invited him to share some cake, knowing the train could not leave without its driver.

Story continues below advertisement

When my own departure date arrived, I was torn between reluctance to leave and giddy anticipation of riding the rails. The train crew was another cast of quirky characters who pampered me for the next two days. Munching treats in the dome car, I watched tundra slip into forest and signs of human habitation emerge bit by bit. When I couldn’t stay awake another minute, I snuggled into my own private sleeping cocoon.

At no point did anyone in Churchill imply that I was too old to be there. We were all busy exploring the environment and the history. The next time I have an opportunity for some offbeat adventure I’m going to take it. And so should you. You won’t be younger next year.

“Hey, what’s that?”

The middle-aged man stepping out of the pizza shop startled me as I closed the car door after parking. He was staring intently at my new ride, a 2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer in an eye-wateringly bright robin’s-egg blue. “I love the look, man. I even love the colour.”

A bit surprising, considering he didn’t seem to be part of the demographic for this subcompact crossover. I explained to him that the Trailblazer is all-new for this year, just going on sale this month, but that I couldn’t tell him much because I had just picked it up from a dealer and was on my way home. “Read about it in The Globe and Mail,” I said cheekily.

Well, sir, if you are reading this, I can tell you that you would probably like almost everything about the Trailblazer. Slotting in just above the woeful Trax in Chevrolet’s SUV portfolio, the Trailblazer mimics its Blazer big brother in styling, and in a week of city driving and over a good return highway haul between Toronto and Kingston, I grew more and more impressed with it.

The pizza guy is right, too; it is an attractive little car. More angular and boxy than others in the class, this RS version also has an aggressive grille that could remind you of a Camaro. If you squint.

But it’s the performance that will win over drivers. The base engine is a 1.2-litre three-cylinder coupled to a continuously variable transmission, but this RS has a 1.3-litre three-cylinder with a nine-speed automatic. That may sound tiny, but it packs 155 horsepower and 174 lb.-ft. of torque. In both city and highway travel, it proved more than peppy and seemed happy with spirited driving. The transmission is smooth, though with a stab of the throttle from lower speeds, it takes more than a second to jump down gears and get going.

Open this photo in gallery The cloth seats are tight but comfortable. Neil Vorano/The Globe and Mail

However, the Trailblazer, especially in top trims, has a bit of a price problem. The $23,698 base price of the LS is on the higher side compared with its subcompact rivals. The LS, with its 1.2-litre engine and standard front-wheel drive (all-wheel drive is optional), lacks some basic standard equipment such as cruise control and a cargo cover. Stepping up to the LT is probably what most people will do, as it’s the best value of the lot with a few more driver aids and comfort features.

The top-tier RS and Activ, both AWD, share the same base price, but here’s the problem: My RS tester, with added Sun and Liftgate package, Convenience package, Technology package and red metallic interior inserts, is a whopping $35,578. Add in freight and taxes, and it’s close to the $40,000 mark. Only the Honda HR-V approaches that price, and it’s thousands more than others in the subcompact-crossover class.

Regardless, this little Chevrolet in its bright-blue paint won over quite a few people, including myself and the pizza guy. With good looks, better-than-average performance and a host of available features, it can be a standout addition to the crowded subcompact crossover segment.

Looks

Open this photo in gallery 18-inch alloy wheels add a touch of urban style. Neil Vorano/The Globe and Mail

It’s a winner here, swapping swoopy lines for sharp angles, and the grille configuration with its hexagonal inserts in black gloss has a high-end look. The black plastic cladding is just enough to suggest a more rugged attitude without looking cheap, while the 18-inch alloy wheels add a touch of urban style.

Interior

Open this photo in gallery Rear-seat legroom is best-in-class. Neil Vorano/The Globe and Mail

The Trailblazer has a well-designed and attractive interior, though some panels are still hard plastic. The RS trim has contrasting stitching on the cloth seats, which are a bit tight but still comfortable. The controls are ergonomic, and the cockpit even gets a D-shaped steering wheel. Seats are a bit tight, but legroom for both front and rear passengers is good. Front passengers have ample space, while rear passenger legroom is best-in-class.

Performance

The 1.3-litre is surprisingly peppy, even on the highway, where getting to passing speed is relatively quick after a brief pause for turbo lag. It’s in town that the delay of the nine-speed transmission kicking down a gear is noticeable and sometimes a little disconcerting, especially if you’re making a left turn through an intersection. The ride is decently sprung, but steering is numb and overboosted.

Tech

Open this photo in gallery A small Chevy logo shows where to wave your foot to trigger the automatic lift gate. Neil Vorano/The Globe and Mail

The LS and LT get quite a few standard driver-assist features such as automatic forward braking, but the RS is fully loaded with many more, including adaptive cruise control and creature comforts such as automatic climate control, eight-inch touch screen and a panoramic sunroof. A small Chevrolet logo is projected on the ground to show you where to swing your foot to activate the automatic lift gate. Of course, you do get what you pay for.

Cargo

Open this photo in gallery The rear seats drop in a 60/40 configuration. Neil Vorano/The Globe and Mail

Overall, the Trailblazer has a respectable 1,540 litres of cargo volume. Not only do the rear seats fold in a 60/40 configuration, but the front passenger seat folds almost flat to accommodate longer items such as a kayak.

The verdict

While the Chevrolet Trailblazer RS is loaded with features, has surprisingly good power and a comfy ride, this one is just too expensive for a subcompact crossover. My money would be with the Trailblazer LT AWD with the 1.3-litre engine.

Layton Reid was a globe-trotting photographer—then came a melanoma diagnosis. He returned home to Halifax to work as a wedding photographer. After remission, he got married and had a son. But, the melanoma returned and it was now at Stage IV. This Is Not the End of Me is Dakshana Bascaramurty’s tale of her friend’s three-year journey as he tried desperately to stay alive for his young son, Finn, and then found purpose in preparing Finn for a world without him.

As her return to work and Finn’s transition to daycare loomed, it was difficult for Candace to come to terms with the fact that Finn was no longer a baby, no longer an appendage whose survival was dependent on her. And that, more than anything, made her long for another baby. But Layton had now made it clear that wasn’t going to happen. This wasn’t something she could wear him down on like she had with so many things before. What bothered her was that Layton couldn’t cut her any slack, couldn’t bring himself to see her perspective, or even sympathize with what was a natural hormonal, emotional response to this point of transition. Why did he see her motivations as selfish?

Candace brought up the possibility of marriage counselling, but with so much on both their plates, it seemed like an inaccessible luxury—to even find the time to go to an appointment or coordinate a house call with a therapist was out of reach. The solution was what it had been since Layton began Gerson: Candace gave in and told her husband that their marriage was more important than having another child. As soon as she let it go, she could feel things thaw between them.

Finn had now gotten used to life without his dad, who had been relegated to a sort of supporting character in his world. At Finn’s daycare, there was a corner where they posted pictures of the children’s parents and siblings, and if a child ever felt particularly homesick or upset, one of the staff would walk him or her up to the wall to stare at their family snapshot. The idea of that was so heartbreaking to Layton: that these children might be traumatized by being separated from their families for only a few hours. What would happen if it wasn’t only one day? What if it was forever? Surely a photo on the wall wouldn’t cut it.

The sadder thought: would Finn even take comfort from seeing his father’s photo on the wall? Now Layton, in recovery from lung surgery, could see Finn for only about an hour a day after Candace brought him home from daycare. Before, when she carried Finn through the door, he’d screech in excitement at seeing his daddy again, but now he was more subdued. Layton couldn’t hold him or play with him or do much more than watch him while they were in the same room together. He’d become a stranger to his son. Still, it was thrilling to see Finn’s independent personality developing. He had his own language he spoke now, a highly articulate baby babble, and he’d mimic his parents and dance and give high fives to anyone who asked for one. This was the motivation to get better that outweighed all the rest. Layton believed that Finn needed him to some small degree, but he needed Finn more.





In a house with a loud, obnoxious dog, a wild toddler, and the frequent presence of two extroverted women, Callie the cat was in many ways the member of the household most like Layton. And so when she died in the new year, Layton took it harder than Candace did. He and Callie could be in each other’s company, silent, not needy, but a mutually comforting presence. In Ottawa, in those difficult months following Layton’s first diagnosis, Callie would sit on his chest: a warm, furry mound lightly breathing as he watched TV or worked on his laptop. She always found a way to lighten the mood. But as new members moved into the household, the attention she received steadily decreased.

Their veterinarian thought Callie had leukemia and had advised they put her down. At the appointment, Layton found it chilling to see a warm body inhaling oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide suddenly go cold and still.

When Layton returned home, it was as if Finn knew his father had experienced loss: he reached out to him more to play, to snuggle. Even though Layton knew intellectually that his son was too young to understand death or mourning, he took comfort in explaining this extra affection this way. It was a wonder that this child, who so recently had been a clump of cells, was now showing early signs of empathy. Layton’s favourite framed photo in the house was the one of Finn on the day he was born: freshly pulled out of Candace, a wrinkled mass, eyes wide and adjusting to the light and, more broadly, to the world outside his mother’s body.





In April, Layton went in for a CT scan and he was feeling optimistic. If things came back clear, he’d wind down Gerson and return to something of a normal life again. He’d been figuring out how to re-enter the photography scene—a full-day wedding would be too much for him to dive right into, but maybe he could set up some kind of portrait business, an interesting way of capturing all the guests who attended a wedding.

On the day of the appointment, Candace and Layton took a bottle of champagne with them. Layton had previously joked with his parents, “If it’s clean, I’m gonna pop it open. If it’s not, I’m going to get on the bridge and jump.”

The scan was clean. No cancer. Layton and Candace walked out of the office beaming, playfully shoving each other and saying, “You were scared!” “No, YOU were scared!”

They strolled down the bridge, the one Layton now didn’t have to jump off, popped the cork on the champagne, and both glugged some down. Layton was aware that he’d feel terrible the next day, but wouldn’t it be nice to feel terrible from a good, old-fashioned hangover than from cancer for a change?

They headed to Willie and Phil’s. Layton raced up the stairs to the den, the same place where he’d told his parents about the stomach and lung tumours two years earlier, and shared the news with them.

“That’s great, that’s great,” Willie said, smiling, and then she and Phil started talking about other things. Layton’s face fell.

“Well, fuck, this is the best news!” he said, annoyed that they weren’t understanding the significance of what he’d told them.

Willie reminded him gently that he’d always asked that they not get too high on the highs or too low on the lows. Willie knew she couldn’t be too happy about this because things could change at any moment.

Layton had asked the surgeon for a digital copy of his CT scan and received a stark greyscale image of his abdomen: his lungs asymmetrical black masses; his stomach a little blob nestled into his liver; his ribs a string of small rounds, like slices of calamari. Everything looked a little skewed and to the wrong scale, but what was important was that there were no tumours—what had been cut out with surgical instruments had stayed out. He thought about blowing up the scan at Kinko’s, sticking it in a big frame and mounting it in the bathroom or living room—visitors might take it to be a macabre art piece, but to him it would be a source of inspiration. Maybe seeing that scan would help his parents understand how huge this news was.

But Willie and Phil had been right to hold back from celebrating with their son. A week later, Layton, Candace, and Finn were playing in the yard when the colour suddenly drained from Layton’s face. He told Candace he was tired and needed to sit down, and she followed him inside. As he stood in the kitchen, he suddenly looked up to the ceiling, his neck tracing a circular path as though there was a bird or wasp flying overhead. Then his legs buckled under him and his whole towering frame fell to the kitchen floor and he began convulsing.

An essential building block for many classic cocktails, from martinis to manhattans, vespers to negronis, vermouth continues to enjoy a welcome resurgence. It’s such a staple for mixology that it’s easy to overlook that it doesn’t need to be mixed with other spirits at all.

Traditionally produced in Italy and France, vermouth is made from wine that’s been fortified with neutral grape spirit (unaged brandy) and bottled between 16 and 18 per cent alcohol. Its real character, however, comes from flavour enhancement by various herbs, botanicals and spices, and whether it’s made in dry (typically white) or sweet styles (red or white).

Story continues below advertisement

Mildly bitter red vermouth is usually sweet and more closely associated with Italy: Carpano Antica Formula represents the high end, while Cinzano Rouge and Martini & Rossi hold forth as brand champions. Floral and fragrant white vermouth was popularized by French brands, such as Dolin and Noilly Prat.

Eight innovative spirits to up your summer mixology game

Purists would insist that I explain how the honeyed and citrus-flavoured Lillet Blanc, the fortified wine brand made popular by James Bond’s Vesper Martini order from Casino Royale, isn’t technically vermouth. It contains citrus liqueur and doesn’t include wormwood, which is one of vermouth’s key botanicals and the inspiration for its name. Wormwood in German is “wermut.”

The cocktail boom and rise of craft distilling has created room for an increasing array of vermouths and other wine-based apéritifs to come to market. New and more strongly flavoured styles, including barrel-fermented examples as well as rosé expressions, have joined the ranks and added greater variety for mixologists and consumers to appreciate and explore. Because of the wide assortment of botanicals and selection of wines used in production, vermouth comes in a range of styles based on the producer’s recipe.

In Italy, Spain and France, traditionalists enjoy vermouth served chilled, on the rocks or with soda water with a twist of orange or lemon. (Having occasionally reached for the wrong can in haste, I can attest tonic water works, too.) That’s how I propose you embrace vermouth as summer rolls into fall.

Keep it simple. Keep the bottle in the fridge. (That’s always good practice as vermouth starts to oxidize after a month’s time). Leave mixing cocktails for another day. Embrace its ethereal, floral and refreshing nature, and if you’re so inclined, imagine you’re drinking with the locals in Barcelona.

With communities on Haida Gwaii adapting to increased travel restrictions after a recent COVID-19 outbreak, staycations have taken on a new importance in the remote islands. The 20-person outbreak is believed to have occurred after residents who travelled off-island returned home. So now, in addition to new provincial restrictions banning all visitors to Haida Gwaii, Carla Lutner, chief operations officer of the Gwaii Trust Society, says local leadership is encouraging residents to stay on Haida Gwaii whenever possible.

To help, the Gwaii Trust is offering up to $250 in grants for Haida and residents of Haida Gwaii (Haidagwaii’an) for staycation expenses. “The grant helps locals explore and provides assistance for local tourism businesses,” says Lutner.

Lutner says the grants have been well received. They’ve also provided some much-needed distraction on the hard-hit islands. “A popular topic of conversation is people asking each other, ‘What are you going to do with your staycation money?’” she says.

Families can pool their money, and so far requests for the funds have ranged from cabin rentals on North Beach to cultural tours in Gwaii Haanas to fishing charters for entire families.

A Tourism Industry Association of Canada report predicts that without further support, some 61,000 tourism businesses in Canada, or 57 per cent, are projected to fail, putting 1.66 million Canadians out of work. To stem the losses, government programs have been offering emergency wage subsidies and other grants. Meanwhile, professional organizations have been teaching tourism businesses enhanced cleaning techniques and offering marketing tips to entice locals. But there’s still a need to find innovative ways to get people out exploring safely and spending money locally.

New Brunswick recently announced a $3-million staycation rebate program for residents. The province’s grant encourages locals to stay and spend in nearby communities, and offers a 20-per-cent rebate of up to $1,000 per person. Eligible expenses include travel costs like fuel and car rentals; accommodation including hotels, motels, inns, B&Bs and campsites; restaurant meals; and activities like museum fees and outdoor tours.

Local travel must include a paid overnight stay in the province up to Sept. 30. According to a statement by Tourism, Heritage and Culture Minister Bruce Fitch, “the rebate will not only encourage New Brunswickers to travel and discover the natural beauty and diversity of the province,” but support tourism businesses when they need it the most.

PEI is also exploring ideas that will spur in-province travel. Internationally, Ireland has recently announced its own program. Ireland’s staycation voucher offers citizens a refund of 20 per cent on restaurant and hotel bills in the form of a tax credit. The rebate, which begins in October and is expected to run until April, 2021, is good for individual expenses up to €625 (with the rebate worth up to €125, or roughly $195), and double that for couples. Regionally, 56,000 households in Kerry are receiving an additional €100 that can be used for a range of registered county accommodations, in an effort to keep them even closer to home.

James Cowpar, co-owner of Haida Style Expeditions, which specializes in cultural adventure tours, says for businesses, the $250 individual grants are a lifeline. The Indigenous-owned company, which normally hosts travellers from around the world on its daily tours, had been expecting a banner season. Instead, as trips were cancelled and deposits returned, the company initially fell through the cracks of the federal stimulus funding.

Now, Cowpar says they hope to run two to three tours a week for August and September. “The benefits will help to keep local businesses alive, and will give people an opportunity to visit Gwaii Haanas and enjoy outdoor recreation,” he says.

Destinations that don’t have financial incentives to encourage locals to visit are still hoping travellers bust out their travel savings and splurge on local experiences.

Maya Lange, vice-president of marketing at Destination BC, says local support is going to be crucial to the long-term survival of many tourism businesses: “When you support tourism businesses, you support your friends, families and neighbours, and the small businesses that make up the foundation of our industry.”

Equally important, says Lange, is the fact that tourism businesses contribute to a region’s identity. “Tourism plays a positive role in preserving, sharing and celebrating the rich culture and history of B.C.‘s diverse communities and people,” she says. “Think about the things we enjoy that would not be as viable without the tourism engine: museums and galleries; festivals and sports events; air, highway and coastal transportation; dining and wine touring; and parks and recreational facilities.”

Paramount Resources Ltd. said Monday the amalgamation of Strath Resources and Cona Resources is not in the best interests of shareholders and exercised its right of dissent under Alberta Business Corporations Act. The move means Paramount is entitled to a cash payment of the value of its common shares.

Waterous Energy Fund (WEF), run by former investment banker Adam Waterous, announced last week it is merging its heavy oil and natural gas companies and has bought a large stake in a privately held oil sands producer to gain economies of scale and maintain access to capital.

Story continues below advertisement

The new Calgary-based company, called Strathcona Resources Ltd., will produce about 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, around two-thirds of which is in the form of condensate and heavy oil. The rest is natural gas.

According to Mr. Waterous, WEF invested $1.5-billion in six transactions to create Strathcona Resources. The last acquisition was Cona’s purchase of debt-hobbled Pengrowth Energy Corp. early this year, which brought with it the Lindbergh steam-driven heavy oil project near Cold Lake, Alta.

Paramount president and chief executive Jim Riddell did not return requests for comment, but the company said in a statement it didn’t think the amalgamation – nor the process under which the deal was approved – were in the best interests of shareholders.

Mr. Waterous told The Globe and Mail in an interview Tuesday he was “surprised” with Paramount’s decision, given WEF received a comprehensive fairness analysis from ATB prior to the merger.

“We had other very large, very sophisticated shareholders in WEF that had different interests in each business [Strath and Cona], and we had unanimous support for this,” he said.

In 2018, Strath bought Paramount’s oil and gas producing assets in the Kakwa region of northwestern Alberta for $340-million, with half paid in cash and the rest by 85 million common shares at $2 each.

The deal gave Paramount 15.6-per-cent ownership of Strath and a seat on its board of directors, but Mr. Waterous said the merger would have seen Paramount’s share of the new business slip back to single digits.

Story continues below advertisement

Paramount held common shares of Strath valued at $170-million prior to the amalgamation, according to investment analysts Stifel First Energy.

However, Stifel also noted the value of those shares likely fell in the face of the global economic slowdown and oil price retreat because of the COVID-19 pandemic. That decline was reflected in Paramount’s second-quarter results, which valued its “level three” investments (including its stake in Strath) at $97-million at the end of June.

Paramount’s net debt sat at $810-million at the end of the second quarter, which Stifel said would make any sort of cash injection a positive move for the energy company.

But the introduction of artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies promises to challenge this century-old model. In fact, this could be an opportunity to rethink a post-work component of the model that may no longer fit: retirement.

Why our perception of retirement is outdated

The idea of retirement was invented in 1881 by Otto von Bismarck, then-minister president of Prussia. According to Bismarck, “those who are disabled from work by age and invalidity have a well-grounded claim to care from the state.” The idea took nearly a decade to implement, but the official age of retirement was eventually set at 70. Other countries followed this model. But in the 1880s, the life expectancy in Prussia was also 70. The benefits were designed to last people a year, at best.

In Canada, the average retirement age is 64, but the life expectancy is now 82 (and rising). Moreover, the number of people over the age of 65 is expected to double by 2036. Canadians, in combination with a small supplemented income from the federal government (if you qualify), have to save enough money to last almost 20 years without a salary. Economically speaking, both government budgets and citizen savings accounts are becoming more strained.

Studies suggest that early retirement is not good for our health. In 2019, U.S. researchers concluded that “pension benefits and retirement actually resulted in reduced cognitive performance,” with the largest indicator being delayed recall, an early sign of dementia. In fact, the OECD has recommended the eventual elimination of all mandatory retirement policies.

Moreover, age alone does not necessitate retirement. Indeed, the World Health Organization has confirmed that “age is not a reliable indicator when judging a worker’s potential productivity,” and that “policies enforcing mandatory retirement ages do not actually help create jobs for youth.”

But most compellingly, Harvard Business Review concluded that the concept of retirement itself may be flawed. The islands of Okinawa in the East China Sea are home to the people with the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world. Okinawan women are three times more likely to reach the age of 100 than North American women. In the Okinawa Islands, the concept of retirement simply does not exist. According to the Harvard Business Review, “literally nothing in their language describes the concept of stopping work completely.” Instead, the Okinawa people have ikigai, “the reason you wake up in the morning.” In other words, the thing that drives you and is fundamentally critical to your existence. Even after controlling for variables such as diet, age and education, a seven-year study conducted by Tohoku University’s Graduate School of Medicine revealed that 95 per cent of seniors with ikigai lived until the end of the seven-year study, compared to 83 per cent of those without an ikigai.

How artificial intelligence can help

By 2030, the most dominant form of work is forecasted to be independent contracting – self-employed individuals who are contracted for specific projects or services – for both blue-collar and white-collar jobs. This is because organizations will need to stay nimble to adapt to the dynamic state of technology. Hiring workers for specific tasks and projects instead of hiring full-time employees allows for more flexibility. However, since independent contractors are self-employed, this presents an opportunity for people to control the capacity of their workload and redefine the work week around a schedule that works for them, a solution touted by Harvard Business Review for managing a multigenerational workforce. For someone over 65, this could mean taking on a project that requires only one day of work a week, for example, or only working in the afternoons.

Other examples of making jobs more accessible to an older workforce include:

Modified tasks: Physically taxing jobs, such as manufacturing lines, that still require human involvement can be accompanied by collaborative robots to help older workers with tasks that are physically complex or require heavy lifting. Nissan has successfully taken this approach.

Remote work: For more knowledge-based jobs, video-conferencing platforms and communication tools have enabled remote work. This may be a more favourable option for older workers.

Rethinking retirement is not about taking away people’s opportunity to finally rest, but about empowering people with the choice to live life in a way that works for them. It can be a way that allows all of us to find – or hold onto – our ikigai.

The record confirms, according to a widely accepted definition, that Wall Street’s most closely followed index entered a bull market after hitting its pandemic low on March 23. It has surged about 55% since then.

That makes the bear market that started in late February the S&P 500′s shortest in its history.

Since the March 23 closing low, the S&P posted the largest gain in a 103-day period in 87 years, according to Refinitiv data.

Trillions of dollars in fiscal and monetary stimulus have made Wall Street flush with cash, pushing yield-seeking investors into equities. Amazon and other high growth technology-related stocks have been viewed as the most reliable to ride out the crisis.

Doubts about the underlying health of the economy, however, persisted in Tuesday’s session, with lukewarm reactions to bumper results from Home Depot and Walmart limiting gains.

The S&P 500 flirted with all-time highs for several sessions before finally hitting a new record, raising questions about whether this run of gains could last.

“The S&P 500 has been impressive and has created a lot of wealth, but I am not sure that reflects the overall health of the economy,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital.

“The rally has more to do with asset inflation, which is fueled by all the liquidity and all the continued support in the economy as well as the weakening dollar,” he added.

Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 67.32 points, or 0.24%, to 27,777.59, the S&P 500 gained 7.79 points, or 0.23%, to 3,389.78 and the Nasdaq Composite added 81.12 points, or 0.73%, to 11,210.84.

In Canada, stocks closed slightly lower, pressured by a 1.58% dip in the energy sector. The S&P/TSX Composite Index lost 30.06 points, or 0.18%, at 16,626.06. The Canadian benchmark index remains more than 7% below its all-time high set in February of this year, in part because of its heavy weighting in the oil and gas sector and its minimal exposure to technology names.

The October crude futures contract in New York retreated five cents to US$43.12 per barrel.

The December gold contract advanced US$14.40 to US$2,013.10 an ounce and the September copper contract gained seven cents to nearly US$2.98 a pound - but the TSX materials sector ended the day with a 0.42% loss.

Meanwhile, the Nasdaq clocked its 18th record closing high since early June, when it confirmed its recovery from the coronavirus sell-off. Tuesday’s record was its 34th record close so far this year compared with 31 record closing highs in 2019 and 29 in 2018.

Consumer discretionary rose the most among major S&P sectors on strength in Amazon while technology stocks provided another major support to the benchmark index.

Home Depot Inc reported its biggest rise in quarterly same-store sales in at least two decades, however, its shares fell about 1% after analysts cautioned that its sales might have hit their peak.

Walmart Inc traded marginally higher after posting its biggest-ever growth in online sales as shoppers cashed in stimulus checks and ordered everything from electronics and toys to groceries from the safety of their homes amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data on Tuesday showed U.S. homebuilding accelerated by the most in nearly four years in July in the latest sign the housing sector is emerging as one of the few areas of strength in an economy suffering a record slowdown. That further added to market optimism.

Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s recent meeting due on Wednesday, meanwhile, may provide some insight into how the central bank sees the recovery playing out. The Fed has cut rates to near zero to bolster business through the pandemic.

“Some couples should not share a double kayak,” said the guide who came up beside us as my husband wildly waved his paddle in the air.

My husband and me were fighting in the double kayak.

Story continues below advertisement

It was 2005, and we were kayaking with a group in Desolation Sound, up the B.C. coast from Vancouver. The rain was dripping into the water; a seal came up behind the kayak and then disappeared. It was beautiful, but we had missed a part of it while we were arguing. I had volunteered us for the double kayak, dreaming of a romantic shared experience, while my husband looked leery about my expectations. In retrospect, my husband and the guide were right – we would have enjoyed our time better together while each paddling our own boats.

The guide’s comment reminded me that I’ve tended to make assumptions and control experiences rather than enjoying the moment and letting the current flow. I have often pondered that moment since. After that trip, I realized the trick to our relationship was in how we could balance shared experience with personalized autonomy – how we could move in parallel without being too tightly coupled on our path.

We never fit the cliché of a traditional relationship. We met in 1999, when I was sleep-deprived after a night shift as a neurology resident. He was a chef, and served me a coffee. As a pickup line, he told me he was a man of the 90s, able to cook; I told him I was a woman of the 90s and couldn’t. He then told me his favourite medium to work with was chocolate – almost too much to bear. The rest was history, as they say.

We had some idyllic months while first dating, until reality struck. As we settled into our relationship, I told him he needed to change his cooking habits because I was exhausted from trying to run off the calories. I was too focused and found him to not be focused enough. I liked to plan, he preferred spontaneity. We repeated these criticisms, not always seeing the strengths in the other’s approach. While we sparred, life happened. Our relationship dynamics appeared to follow a pattern: first careening through challenges like unplanned pregnancy and rushed marriage, followed by my deliberate deceleration of our lives, buckling down to study and pass my neurology fellowship exams within the same year. We’ve always gotten to our destinations and goals, but our marriage has never smoothly glided over the waves.

We moved to Vancouver, and he became the caregiver for our two children. On the surface, he was the “househusband” stereotype: cooking, nurturing and maintaining our home. However, I never thought of him in the traditional domestic role. In fact, he wasn’t much of a “housewife,” instead contributing to a chaotic and messy home. He held multi-course dinners for his friends, keeping our children up late while music blasted and dishes piled up. But I began to see the beauty in this different type of household, watching our children being soothed by hairy, muscled arms. I learned to not expect a Martha Stewart-style home. The children were cared for, and I was the family breadwinner with a full-time medical practice. Somehow, our unusual relationship dynamic kept us afloat, and I learned to love the swirling whirlpools of my husband’s currents in the otherwise slow-flowing routines of our lives.

At times, I chafed at the responsibility of being the primary earner; he chafed at the need to feed a toddler three times per day, when humdrum routine interfered with adventure. It was during these ruminations that we stepped into the double kayak in Desolation Sound. In a way, our guide rescued our marriage when he saw our distress flare across the water. He altered our relationship’s trajectory with his uncomplicated advice that day. After that day, we began to learn to communicate about where we each wanted to go together, charting a course back to each other’s priorities and values. After that day, I resolved to hold my husband’s journey and goals front and centre as I knew he would hold mine, tacking our relationship’s course as a co-ordinated team.

Since then, despite our best efforts, there are still some times of tumult. We have each made mistaken assumptions about what was best for the other. I don’t know what I was thinking when I decided he should perform yoga each morning before starting his 7 a.m. baking shift. The yoga video would advance from the first lying-down corpse pose while he stayed supine on the ground, snoring. And he’s been similarly deluded at times. I took up cycling to support his interests, dreaming of meandering aimlessly in sync. Our relationship temporarily hit a speed bump after he exhibited his coaching fervour, yelling at me to sprint for badges on the Strava activity app. Each time, a clarifying conversation has reoriented us.

Story continues below advertisement

This year marks our 20th year of marriage. Each new year, he humours me as I seriously ask whether we should stay the course for another year. We converse about our individual and shared intentions for the upcoming year, strategizing about how to integrate his adventures into my plans. This planning has helped us to reach further destinations than we would have ever achieved individually. I feel comfortable with the scheduling, and he doesn’t feel constrained in pursuing adventures. Feeling confident in my husband to serve as an anchor if needed, I have sailed further than I ever imagined: becoming a physician, an associate professor, an associate dean, a mother and a wife. I think our sustained enthusiasm for our relationship is in the thrills of surfing over shared waves of family drama balanced with the joys of gliding over still seas of routine while we remain tethered on our individual paths.

We’re charting new territory as a family; our eldest is in university, and she’s drifting down her own tributary. Unexpectedly, my husband has wished to moor the boat, encouraging my daughter to stay. I see his pride in what he built for our family, and his joy in memories of school trips and lunches. Conversely, I wish to see her move forward, having observed her elegant navigation toward her own success. Maybe I’m recalling my own ambitious career path as a woman – I want her to experience the same thrills in life’s ups and downs. And now, I want to provide a base for my husband to launch renewed career goals and exploits.

Through this journey, I am secure in knowing that after we steer through this fork in the river, my husband and me will paddle down the new passage together. However, despite where we have come to and where we have come from, I still won’t step back into a double kayak with him. Instead, I would rather take my own kayak and float down the river, buoyed by him cresting the rapids. That kayaking guide’s advice has never steered me wrong.

Over the years, I can safely say I’ve had every kind of wine opener in my possession. For a tool that’s built for one purpose, there is an incredible variety of designs that range in price from cheap to extravagant.

A few models were prized for their ease of use, a couple were most effective for a specific task – say, opening older wines with a natural cork – and countless others have been passed along to students, family and friends or seized at the airport, having been forgotten in carry-on luggage over the years.

Aging well: These eight wines are here for a good time or, should you choose, a long time

The best corkscrew is whichever style you’re comfortable with. I’m not fond of electric corkscrews, but know how essential they can be for wine lovers with arthritis or limited hand strength.

For ease of use, many look to the wing or winged style devices. Lever models are even simpler to handle – two swift motions: worm goes in, cork pulls out – but are a significant investment.

A number of family members and friends swear by their continuous pull corkscrews, popularized by the Screwpull brand, which is now sold as Le Creuset. These call for a bit of pressure and clockwise turns that drive the worm into the cork and gently remove it. They are pricey, but really effective. I’ve given a number of these as gifts over the years.

The two-pronged cork extractor, which goes by the name Ah-So or butler’s thief, is a specialized piece of equipment. Its best use is for opening aged wines. There’s no worm, just two thin blades that you wiggle back and forth down the neck of the wine bottle before pulling the cork up. They’re not for the faint of heart, as it’s easy to push the cork into the wine by mistake.

If I had to single out one essential model, I’d default to a double-lever waiter’s friend corkscrew. These are the industry standard for good reason. Durable. Affordable. Functional. Pulltap’s or Koala are the brands to look for. Knock-off versions tend to break easily.

It may take you a few attempts to get the hang of it, but once perfected that technique will serve you for life. Widely available for less than $20, these corkscrews last and free up your disposable income to spend on what really matters – bottles of wine to open and enjoy.

Bodies are so unruly. We like to think we have control over them: that we can schedule meltdowns and malfunctions, or that we can eat to beat disease and ingest enough teas and tinctures for our bodies to remain docile and adherent to our commands.

But I’ve learned that’s not how it works.

I sat on the toilet one morning recently and noticed the sticky note on the wall looking back at me. “Pee in container!” I had written on it. “Darn,” I thought, “I really do need reminders more than I want to admit.” I ran upstairs and grabbed the large orange collection container I had picked up at the lab the day before. I shut the toilet lid and put the container on top for next time.

Just over a year ago, I had a kidney stone removed surgically. The procedure went fine but afterward, I developed sepsis – the body’s extreme response to a severe infection – and endured a frightening and painful week in hospital. When I was better, I committed to doing everything I could to avoid that experience again. And so began the referrals and tests to figure out why I am apparently very prone to kidney stones.

Collecting your urine in a giant orange container for 24 hours is one of the tests used to understand kidney stone formation, and I have completed it only somewhat successfully four times now. You’d think with each passing urine collection that I would get smarter, more practical, a urine specimen whiz. But every time the test comes due, I find myself dumbfounded as to how one goes about collecting urine in a three-litre jug while carrying out the rest of their day.

This lack of insight doesn’t surprise me, though. I’m a registered nurse who has taken care of a lot of people, and I can’t tell you the number of times I have asked patients to fit an unrealistic medical something-or-other into their day, always crossing my fingers they’ll succeed. “Please take this pill, on this day, at this time, with this food but not that food, and not if you are going to be in the sun, and don’t forget to drink lots of water.”

The urine collection container is handed to you in a large brown paper bag that looks like it might contain enough burgers and fries to feed a family. However, the lack of grease on the bag makes it obvious you’re trying to hide something other than emotional eating. When I take the bag from the lab receptionist and it crinkles loudly in my hand, I always find myself looking left and right as if I might find an even bigger sack to quickly hide the obvious quirkiness of how I will be spending my next 24 hours.

The paper bag masking the unsightly container reminds me of what we do with our bodies all the time. We think we can hide what we don’t want others to see by creating elaborate versions of ourselves using clothing and makeup and showcasing our favourable traits. Underneath the costumes, though, and despite all the supplements, lives a human body with its own calendar of mishaps and its own agenda.

Really, the body we inhabit is an entity unto itself. It doesn’t always align with the human energy that lives inside, which can be due to anything from rapid aging or unforeseen illness. And at some point in all of our lives, we are destined to come face to face with what is happening within our bodies. To step back and realize we are only human. To ask for help from our friends, neighbours and families. To be humbled when they show up for us, change our sheets and bring us soups. To seek counsel from experts. And hopefully, in the process, to learn how to say, “Thank you for caring about my unruly body.”

The 24-hour urine collection container instructions ask that you keep the container and its contents refrigerated. This is a conundrum because my fridge has no obvious spot for a massive jug of pee. Large jars and yogurts on the top shelf. A 12-pack of something fizzy, butter and bowls of cut-up fruit and veg on the middle shelf. And on the bottom shelf goes all the rest. The jug won’t fit in a crisper drawer – I’ve tried. An entire fridge reorganization is required in order to house the specimen, and I never remember to do this the night before. At 6 a.m. on collection day, there I am perched in front of the fridge laying off expired Worcestershire sauce and furloughing items that will last at room temperature for a day or so. All this in hopes of creating a welcoming spot for a container of urine but not welcoming enough that the jug could be said to be enjoying a cozy experience with the milk and O.J. It is pee, after all.

Through enduring painful experiences – whether it be sepsis or other physical or mental-health challenges – you gain a new perspective. You realize that you can, in fact, be stopped in your tracks. That you don’t have a say in everything. And with the treatment and tapering of excruciating pain comes the realization that idleness and existing in a state of neutral calm can be a beautiful thing. We don’t need to always be numbing the in-between moments with distractions.

Enduring pain and coming out the other side teaches you to let go a little, to take yourself a little less seriously, to stop putting on the costumes day after day. You learn that life at its best is a constellation of millions of small moments: moments that can be hard, moments that can be awful, moments that are always fleeting. You strive to make the most of your moments. To make them worthwhile. To make them joyful. To make them lasting. To make them as warm as the pee that runs down your leg when you miss the orange jug.

Not only is there a new moon on your birthday but Saturn is strong as well, which suggests you possess the ideal combination of self-belief and stamina. Whatever you start this year you won’t stop until it is completed. You’ll make hard work look remarkably easy.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

If you want something enough you will find a way to get it. A new moon in the most dynamic area of your chart means your confidence is at such a high level that failure is simply not an option. You won’t BE a success, you ARE a success.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

Someone needs your assistance and you must drop whatever you are doing and run to their rescue. You have never been one to ignore a cry for help and your willingness to sacrifice your own needs to assist others won’t go unnoticed or unrewarded.

Story continues below advertisement

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Stay calm and don’t let people with opinions you profoundly disagree with get under your skin. There should be room for all shades of opinion in your deliberations – and, who knows, something you are told might actually get you thinking along different lines.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

If you make a decision you must stick with it. The moment you start chopping and changing is the moment when it all starts to fall apart – and could also be the moment when your rivals sense you may not be as confident as you like to appear.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

Today’s new moon in your sign means that even though the Sun will shortly be leaving Leo a new beginning is both possible and desirable. You may have to go off in a direction that others do not approve of but that’s fine – you enjoy being different.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

By all means speak your mind today but be aware that even if other people agree with what you say it won’t necessarily mean they are going to follow your lead. Your arguments may be perfectly logical but some people enjoy being perverse.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

Today’s new moon will give you the courage and the confidence to take on a new task and also to take the kind of risks that make success more likely. You don’t have to be secretive about your ambitions – in fact the more people know about them the better.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

You don’t lack for fighting spirit but you do need to channel it in the right direction. No matter how much someone in a position of power annoys you today DO NOT take them on. Use your energy purely for creative purposes – and keep your lip zipped!

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

The plans you made earlier in the year are beginning to pay off, if not financially then certainly in terms of power and prestige. Don’t allow yourself to be distracted by people who don’t share your drive and determination – there’s still lots you need to accomplish.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

If you want to start something of a business nature then now is the time. Today’s new moon will make it easy for you to approach people who can pull financial strings and make it happen for you. But remember, their assistance won’t come for free.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

You have your suspicions that someone is up to no good and what happens today will help you prove it. It may, however, pay to keep what you discover to yourself for now. The value of that information is likely to grow with time.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

You may not have quite as much energy in your tank as you think you do, so pace yourself sensibly and make sure you are never in a situation where you have to rely on other people to get you over the finishing line. Choose your races wisely.

STRINGER/AFP/Getty Images

Hours after mutinying soldiers seized Mali’s top leadership in an apparent coup, the West African nation’s president announced on state television that he would step down.

The resignation capped a day of dramatic developments and exposed the deepening instability of a country that has become one of Canada’s biggest recipients of military and development aid.

Earlier Tuesday, thousands of people cheered and celebrated in the streets of Mali’s capital, Bamako, as the rebel soldiers drove through the city in armoured vehicles. The city has been consumed by mass protests since June as a result of widespread anger over corruption, a weakening economy and worsening armed conflicts in much of the country.

President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and Prime Minister Boubou Cissé were detained by soldiers and escorted to the Kati military base, about 15 kilometres from the capital, according to photos on social media.

The same military base had been the origin of an earlier coup in 2012, which in turn had ignited years of deadly insurgency by Islamist radicals and other militia forces in northern and central regions of the country, killing thousands of people.

Since the beginning of the insurgencies, Mali has received an outpouring of aid from Western and African countries, including thousands of French troops and a United Nations peacekeeping force. Canada contributed by deploying helicopters and hundreds of peacekeeping soldiers to northern Mali from 2018 to 2019. But the massive aid has failed to quell the insurgencies or stabilize the fragile government.

Mali has received nearly $1.6-billion in development aid from Canada over the past two decades, including more than $136-million from 2017 to 2018, making it one of the world’s top recipients of Canadian aid. Over the past 18 months, Canada has also deployed units of police officers in Mali to support peace efforts and the reform of Mali’s security forces.

Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne, in a tweet on Tuesday, said Canada is “very concerned” by the Mali situation and “strongly condemns” the military mutiny against the government.

Canadian embassy staff in Mali are safe, he said. “We will continue to follow the situation closely.”

The United States, France, the United Nations, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States also condemned the military rebellion.

Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairperson of the African Union Commission, called for the “immediate release” of the President and Prime Minister from their “forced detention.” In a statement, he rejected any attempt at “unconstitutional change of government” and urged the mutineers to cease all violence.

The UN Security Council is reported to have called an emergency session for Wednesday to discuss the Mali crisis. There are about 13,000 soldiers and almost 2,000 police officers in the UN peacekeeping mission in Mali. France and West African countries also have thousands of soldiers in the country.

Bruno Charbonneau, a peacekeeping expert and associate professor at Royal Military College Saint-Jean in Quebec, said the mutiny and apparent coup on Tuesday had been unforeseen by experts but should not have shocked anyone.

“It is unsurprising given the stalemate of the last few years: A peace process that was going nowhere, the mounting violence notably in the central regions, a government that seemed unable and incapable of responding positively to the situation and a President who often seemed disconnected or reluctant to change his ways,” Mr. Charbonneau told The Globe and Mail.

A recent report by a UN panel of experts showed that Malian government officials “were working against the peace process and benefiting from it,” he said.

Moreover, there has been an “undeniable failure” of the international approach to Mali and the broader Sahel region, and a new strategy might now be adopted, Mr. Charbonneau said.

The international community has allowed the conflicting groups in Mali “to prolong and at times avoid the peace process, to make sure that it went nowhere,” he said. The peace process has been shaped by a counterterrorism agenda that created incentives for armed groups and government officials to undermine peace, he said.

Mr. Keita, President since 2013, has been the target of growing protests for months. Last month, at least 11 people were killed during clashes between protesters and security forces. Many people have been angered as Mali’s military has increasingly lost control of much of the country while the insurgencies grow.

The insurgencies that began in 2012 culminated in an Islamist offensive that drove south toward Bamako from northern Mali until it was halted by French military intervention in early 2013. But the continuing heavy presence of French troops and other forces failed to prevent the latest coup.

On Tuesday, as the mutiny began, Mr. Cissé issued a statement appealing for dialogue with the rebel soldiers. But he soon disappeared from view, until the mutineers took him and the 75-year-old President to their base.

A video posted on Facebook soon after the June 1 incident showed an RCMP officer drive toward the man and knock him down with the open door of the vehicle. Five officers then arrested him in a rough manner, and placed him under detention in police cells, where court documents show that he was brutally beaten by a fellow inmate, before being airlifted to hospital in Iqaluit. An RCMP statement said he was charged with intoxication in a public place, after members of the public told a Mountie a man was fighting. The charge was later dropped.

The investigation, initiated by Michelaine Lahaie, chairwoman of the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP, is the third into the episode. The Ottawa Police Service is doing a criminal investigation, at the RCMP’s request, into the conduct of the officer who hit the man with the door, and the RCMP is doing an internal review.

Nunavut RCMP recorded for second time violently arresting an Inuk man

Ms. Lahaie said the commission’s review will be broader in that it will also look at the beating the man suffered in custody, whether his jailers took reasonable steps to ensure his safety, whether his conditions in detention were adequate and whether he received adequate medical care after the violent encounter in the cell.

“Consideration will also be given as to whether racial bias and/or discrimination played a role in the man’s arrest and subsequent treatment,” Ms. Lahaie said in a news release on Tuesday.

She said the commission will also monitor the police and RCMP investigations of the episode. And, she said, the commission will address whether the arrest of the man was reasonable in the circumstances.

“I am concerned with the conduct of RCMP members involved in this serious incident,” Ms. Lahaie said. “I am aware that there is historical distrust by Inuit toward the police and I am committed to increasing RCMP accountability.”

The incident, which occurred in Kinngait (formerly Cape Dorset), a community of about 1,500 people, is similar to another interaction this summer recorded on video and posted to social media. The second one happened Aug. 9, also in Kinngait, when a man sleeping on a roadway was kneed three times by an RCMP officer during an arrest for public intoxication. (He was detained until sober, then released without charge.) And the Mounties in Nunavut have been involved in three shootings, two of them fatal, since February. Ottawa Police are investigating, and expected to report soon.

Amanda Jones, the RCMP’s commanding officer in the region, said in an e-mail that she welcomes the investigation and that the RCMP will assist in any way it can.

Benson Cowan, the chief executive officer of Nunavut’s Legal Services Board, which oversees legal aid in the northern territory of 39,000 people, was encouraged by the investigation of the door incident, but said a wider review of RCMP conduct in Nunavut is necessary. He has called on the commission, in letters last June and this January, to begin such a review.

“It’s heartening to see that they’re taking action,” he said in an interview. “It would have been good to see something sooner. Fundamentally, what is needed is a broader more systemic approach. ... Simply investigating these as one-offs does nothing to address the systemic nature of the conduct. But it’s a good start.”

One Hezbollah suspect found guilty, three acquitted in death of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri

A member of Hezbollah has been found guilty by an international court of the 2005 car bombing that killed former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri and 21 others. But it acquitted three other suspects, and ruled there was not enough evidence to link Hezbollah leadership or the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to the assassination.

Hariri, who was backed by Saudi Arabia, France and the United States, was killed as he was lobbying for an end to Syria’s 29-year military presence in Lebanon.

The verdict is likely to add to the tensions in the country, which had already been in deep political and economic crisis prior to the devastating explosion this month in Beirut that killed more than 180 people.

Calgary’s Attabotics gets $50-million from Teachers, Honeywell to expand its ant-inspired warehouse technology

The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan is leading a $50-million (U.S.) investment into warehouse robotics company Attabotics Inc. to help the Calgary firm build out its client roster and technology – vertical storage structures inspired by ant colonies that it says can reduce warehouse footprints by as much as 85 per cent.

Attabotics has redesigned the traditional warehouse from horizontal to vertical and works with a growing number of brands, including the department store chain Nordstrom. Rather than running around endless aisles, Attabotics’s robots scour a single vertical structure to store and move goods to workers who handle packing and shipping.

Scott Gravelle and several partners launched Attabotics in 2015, naming it after Atta, one of the groups of species of leafcutter ants. After watching a documentary in which a scientist poured molten aluminum into an ant habitat, Mr. Gravelle realized that ants’ networks of tunnels and chambers took advantage of vertical pathways and storage.

Fossil fools

Re Alberta Is Losing The Oil Sands PR War (Editorial, Aug. 13): The Globe and Mail’s editorial rightly points out that Canada’s carbon tax, aimed for $50 a tonne by 2022, is not a signal of major ambition. The government would need to increase the tax past 2022 to reach $210 a tonne by 2030 to meet its Paris targets, according to last year’s final report from Canada’s Ecofiscal Commission.

However, I find the editorial misses the mark in its argument that greening Alberta’s oil sands will somehow give it a shot in the global market. Oil sands are among the most expensive oil sources in the world. Its staying power has always depended on a high price a barrel, which is not happening any time soon, if ever, because of the oil glut caused by the pandemic, cheaper oil sources and clean energy growth, to name a few reasons.

Cheryl McNamara Toronto

“When asked about some international investors starting to shun the oil sands, Mr. Kenney declared it was a passing fad, the ‘flavour of the day.’”

My parents lived in a small coal-mining village in Yorkshire that had its heart ripped out by Margaret Thatcher 30 years ago. There was no “just transition” in those days.

Let not our fossil-fuel workers be led to disappointment and despair by fossil fools.

Listen locally

Re Site C Dam Underscores Need For More Time-sensitive Approach To Project Approvals (Aug. 13): I want to endorse contributor Adam Pankratz’s argument that to “prioritize local voices when gathering feedback” is essential, including for reducing excessively long timelines for project reviews. My experience in Canada’s pipeline industry confirms that a pre-regulatory, multi-stakeholder involvement process has unique value.

Story continues below advertisement

This type of sustained, inclusive process powerfully facilitates the earning of trust and strengthening of relationships, while better understanding and addressing local concerns. It does this through a meaningful sharing of control, as well as information, in an atmosphere of mutual respect.

This usually paves the way to a more calm, collaborative and technically informed discussion of all relevant issues.

Such stakeholder involvement tends to achieve dispute-resolution goals by combining the scientific rigour of environmental impact assessments, the economic rationality of cost-benefit analysis and the procedural fairness of quasi-judicial hearings, as well as the democratic and good neighbour principles of priority participation by representatives of communities most directly put at risk.

Re Canada Needs Its Own ‘Build Back Better’ Plan (Report on Business, Aug. 14): Contributor Robert Asselin calls on the Canadian government to match Joe Biden’s industrial policy framework with one of its own. If someone wrote a book about Canadian industrial policies over the past several decades, I believe they would find big outlays of public funds, jobs for friends of the government and firms that received public funds being bought out by U.S. companies, happy to benefit from Canadian subsidies.

Every incoming government claims they have the secret for Canadian economic development. Arthur Kruger, the arch-mandarin with several deputy minister jobs on his CV once said that what Canadian governments should do is limit themselves to providing the infrastructure – good transportation, education and so on – and leave the rest to the private sector.

Current industrial policies deserve some responsibility for the low level of Canadian productivity – about 25 per cent lower than the United States.

CRA insecurity

Re Thousands Of CRA, Government Service Accounts Disabled By Cyberattacks (Aug. 17): Government services have been pushing people to sign up for online accounts for years. To increase the online take up, the Treasury Board of Canada simplified the process by getting people to access federal services with a unique GCKey credential. To make it even easier, you can register for those services by using your banking credentials. This is a tremendous technical fit! One login and one password can now give people online access to all those banking and government services.

The Treasury Board says now that the recent attacks “took advantage of the fact that many people reuse passwords and usernames across multiple accounts.” Do you see the paradox? They blame Canadians for reusing their login and password, but also enabled a system that does just that: same unique credentials for a large number of critical services.

Whoever dreamed of the GCKey system must surely work with the best security experts. Except they forgot the golden rule: In IT security, the weakest link is the person behind the keyboard. If everyone is pushed online by their government, access needs to be designed for the most tech-vulnerable people, not the tech savvy. But do not hold your breath, because the GCKey system will stay even if it is dangerous for my grandmother.

Camp X security

Re Canadian Women’s Army Corps Created (Moment in Time, Aug. 13): My aunt Cecile didn’t join the Canadian Women’s Army Corps. But in the spring of 1942, she did approach Tommy Drew-Brook, the Canadian director of British Security Co-ordination, in the same Toronto building where she worked as a teller. She offered her considerable clerical skills to assist in the war effort.

By June, after a thorough review of her background by the RCMP, she was ensconced at Camp X, enciphering and decoding BSC messages and cables for the famous Hydra coding machine.

One day in the 1970s, she revealed to me that she went through the basic training all Camp X “agents” received. So, her superiors considered her qualified to move to Manhattan, where she sat outside the office of BSC chief Sir William Stephenson for the rest of the war, doing “clerical work” while guarding the door! She was only 27.

Re CFL’s Board To Discuss Fate Of Season After Bid For Federal Loan Falls Through, Sources Say (Aug. 17): Our government has no problem giving WE $43-million to dole out just less than $1-billion for a kids’ volunteer program, but it can’t give the CFL a $30-million interest-free loan. Maybe if Margaret Trudeau was paid to sing the national anthem and Bill Morneau’s family got a flight, hotel and tickets to the Grey Cup, it might get the loan approved.

Riley Brandt/The Canadian Press

Village Brewery, which describes its blond ale as crisp, dry and slightly fruity, is looking to persuade beer lovers that a new batch made from reused waste water tastes just as good.

The Calgary beer-maker has teamed up with University of Calgary researchers and U.S. water technology company Xylem Inc. to brew up a limited 1,600-can batch.

The goal was to show that dirty water – even that flushed from toilets in a major city – can be made safe to drink while helping conserve the globe’s dwindling potable water supply.

“Certainly we do expect some eyebrows raised and the yuck factor is real,” said Christine O’Grady, project co-ordinator at Advancing Canadian Wastewater Assets, or ACWA.

“Part of this project … is to start the conversation about how this can be done, why it should be done and that water is a resource that we need to protect.”

ACWA is a research partnership between the University of Calgary and the City of Calgary that involves the Pine Creek Wastewater Treatment Facility by the Bow River in the city’s southeast.

Municipal waste water normally runs through a complex system involving screens, filters, microbes and ultraviolet light to make it clean enough to return to the river.

The ACWA team took partially treated water from the plant and ran it through more advanced purifying to make it drinkable. That involved ultrafiltration, ozone, ultraviolet light and reverse osmosis.

The idea of making beer from waste water started out as a joke around the boardroom table while Xylem and ACWA were discussing ways to collaborate.

“Then we said, ‘Well, we can make beer,’” Ms. O’Grady said. “We have all the technology. We have the capacity on all sides.”

ACWA approached Village Brewery.

“They’re so progressive and cool. They were all in,” said Ms. O’Grady.

Jackson Stuart, the brewery’s marketing manager, said Village was excited to take part in a project that put sustainability front and centre.

He said he’ll be interested to see how keen customers are to sip suds brewed from repurposed waste water.

“The big thing for us was to try to make sure that the beer tasted the exact same as our other normal Village Blonde and we achieved that,” he said. “We’re confident.”

The only difference in making the beer is that the water didn’t come from the tap, but arrived in tanks.

Alberta Health Services helped the partners develop a safety plan and tested the treated water to make sure it met drinking-water standards.

“With the right measures in place, alternative water sources – such as waste water, grey water, rooftop-collected rainwater and stormwater – can be made safe for many potable and non-potable end uses,” said public-health inspector Jessica Popadynetz.

Bob Sandford, Global Water Futures Chair at the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health, said he believes the “yuck factor” can be overcome.

“The science is absolutely sound and is very convincing. The brewery, too, has done a really good job of explaining this,” he said.

Natural systems have been purifying water to a drinkable standard for hundreds of millions of years, Mr. Sandford said.

“We’re drinking water that’s passed through dinosaurs.”

In a changing climate and an increasingly populated world, high-level tertiary treatment technologies such as those used by ACWA will be crucial, he suggested.

“Because of the numbers of emerging contaminants of concern, we need to have ever more sophisticated water treatment systems and this is what it’s pointing to.”

APU GOMES/AFP/Getty Images

Firefighters struggled to contain three wildfires near Los Angeles on Saturday as forecasters warned that the risk of new fires was high with temperatures expected to spike and humidity levels to drop across California.

A huge forest fire that prompted evacuations north of Los Angeles flared up around noon, sending up a cloud of smoke as it headed toward thick, dry brush in the Angeles National Forest. Although it was burning into forest land, evacuation orders remained in effect for the western Antelope Valley because erratic winds in the forecast could push the fire toward homes, fire spokesman Jake Miller said.

Fire crews managed to stop the fire’s movement down to the desert floor when it flared up Friday afternoon. In one dramatic moment, several firefighters ran to safety when a longhorn bull that was apparently escaping the blaze charged at them.

The Lake Fire was just 12% contained as of Saturday morning, and after threatening more than 5,400 homes, it had charred more than 23 square miles (59.5 square kilometres) of brush and trees. Fire officials said 21 buildings had been destroyed, including at least five homes.

Firefighters were struggling in steep, rugged terrain amid scorching temperatures. The National Weather Service warned temperatures could hit 111 degrees (44 Celsius) in the Antelope Valley Saturday, and winds gusting 15-20 mph (24-32 kph) was expected later in the afternoon.

“In addition to that, we have a very unstable air mass over the Lake Fire that’s going to allow for a pyrocumulus (cloud) development later today so that will create extreme fire behaviour,” meteorologist Matt Mehle said.

Record-breaking heat is possible through the weekend, with triple-digit temperatures and unhealthy air predicted for many parts of the state. There also was a chance of isolated thunderstorms worsening the fire threat by creating dry lightning and strong downdrafts, fire officials said

There was no containment of a blaze that blackened foothills above the Los Angeles suburb of Azusa. It churned through 2.3 square miles (5.96 square kilometres) of brush on Thursday and was moving away from homes. Evacuation orders issued to residents were lifted early Friday.

Azusa police said they were looking for a homeless man suspected of starting the fire. He was identified as Osmin Palencia, 36, and was last known to be living in a riverbed encampment near the site where the fire started.

Police said Palencia was believed to be violent and urged people to use caution if they see him.

Jason Reed/Reuters

Australian mining magnate Gina Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting Pty is hoping a charm offensive, from annual fundraising parties to local refurbishments at a golf course, will help overcome opposition to a massive new coal mine in Canada’s Rocky Mountains.

Hancock unit Riversdale Resources’ Grassy Mountain mine, which is forecast to produce 4.5 million tonnes of steelmaking coal per year, would span 2,800 hectares and could set a precedent for new projects in the region. Opponents say the project would harm wildlife and water in the area.

In June, the province of Alberta, home to most of Canada’s oil reserves, rolled back 1970s-era restrictions on open-pit coal mining to jumpstart an economy hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic and plunging oil prices.

The proposal for Grassy Mountain predates that change. But Alberta’s move is at odds with Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s effort to wean the country from coal and comes as a growing number of banks, insurers and investors shun the fossil fuel due to climate concerns.

Public hearings are slated to begin in October for the Grassy Mountain, which requires federal and provincial approvals.

Hancock is among a raft of Australian companies with projects in the region, aiming to ship coking coal from Alberta to Asian markets. Atrum Coal and privately held Montem Resources are also pursuing nearby mines and exploration ventures, as is private developer Cabin Ridge Project Ltd.

The company has sponsored annual Australia Day fundraising bashes, and also opened a newly rebuilt golf course this month, accompanying eight new holes at the local Crowsnest Pass Golf Club. The work helped clear the way for a coal loadout near the course.

Hancock, which took over the firm that owned Grassy Mountain last year, matched funds raised at this year’s event to support a local senior’s association in Crowsnest Pass, Alberta.

Still, landowners remain worried about water use and habitat destruction in an ecologically sensitive mountain corridor renowned for postcard scenery and wildlife.

“I think 10 years down the road the water will be polluted to the point that we may not be able to grow crops,” said alfalfa farmer Norm Watmough, 76, whose holiday cabin abuts the mine lease. “It’s going to destroy southern Alberta.”

Hancock declined to comment and referred questions to filings in which the company details its plans to treat wastewater.

Landowners said they are worried that selenium from waste rock could leach into nearby waterways. The company has said in filings that it plans to pump water with high selenium and nitrate concentrations to saturated zones in pits and build waste rock dumps at higher elevations to minimize risks.

Miners have welcomed Alberta’s move to loosen environmental protections to increase open-pit mining along the Rockies’ eastern slopes.

Canada has committed to eliminate coal-fired power by 2030 and last month said it would assess climate impacts of new thermal coal mines and exports.

Coking coal is “less of a concern at the present time than thermal coal,” Canadian Environment and Climate Change Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said. “But to the extent that there are significant (project) impacts that can’t be mitigated, then obviously that becomes a lot more challenging.”

Lounging on the leather couch, positioned in front of a 12-foot high window, we watch the summer thunder storm, and its accompanying winds bustle through the tree tops. As I take a slug of my local IPA, the rain whips at the window, coming horizontally in bursts and the tops of the surrounding pines thrash violently, “but see, no movement, totally stable,” Cam Green says. “You wouldn’t know that we’re in a tree house, would you.”

Yes, kind of like Tarzan, we are at home in the trees. Thirteen feet above ground, we’re sat in the main living space of a splendidly luxurious tree house. At 370 square feet, with an additional 210 if you include the outdoor deck space, this home-on-high, this tree fort for grown ups, is the brainchild of Mr. Green and his partner, Lauren. Costing a cool $300,000, the structure, near Minden, Ont., includes a full bathroom with flushing toilet and shower. There’s a king-size bed high in the mezzanine, and the aforementioned living space, which is climate controlled with a heat recovery ventilator, includes sofa, coffee table and propane stove, plus a kitchen area complete with fridge and space for food preparation.

Mr. Green has been fascinated by building in trees since his childhood. “Borrowing” materials from the burn pile behind his parent’s cottage on Balsam Lake, he and his buddies would knock together tree houses in the bush, much like many other kids. But, while others grew up and forgot about their aerial construction projects, Mr Green’s interest in architecture and the potential for building in trees blossomed. In 2014 he took a course in sustainable tree house design and construction, at the Yestermorrow Design Build School, in Waitsfield, Vt. “We learned how to build the specialized foundation structure that you need to support a tree house in a growing tree,” Mr. Green says. “I’d always wanted to turn my dreams into a reality and now I had the skills to do it.”

But, time has a way of getting away on you and it wasn’t until 2019 that the couple could begin their build. The design, by Mr. and Ms. Green, and overseen by B.C. architectural designer Lindsay Duthie of Lindsay Duthie Design Studio, is a tale of two parts. Mr. Green focused on the structural and engineering aspects, while Mrs Green undertook the interior and aesthetic design of the building.

Most critical was the attachment to the two red maple trees, which support half of the building’s weight. Specially engineered for the project by Oregon-based tree house guru, Charlie Greenwood, the tree house attachment bolts (TABs) are a dynamic fixing that runs right through the heart of the tree. The rod and bolt system supports two steel arms that carry heavy I beams, on which the main structural members of the wooden floor system sit. Additionally, three steel posts support the rear of the building, keeping it totally stable.

“The most important element on this kind of project is, of course, the trees,” Mr. Green says. “And with that in mind you must work clean. By that I mean that no dirt or foreign bodies can be allowed to get into the wound that you create in the tree while installing the TAB because they have the potential to infect and damage the tree.”

To this end every cutting and boring tool was sanitized, holes were cleaned out and sanitized as soon as cut and a paint-on sealant that helps the trees heal applied as soon as the TABs were in place.

“The tree is kind of your reason for building a tree house,” Mr. Green says, “so protecting it is paramount. Even the ground under it was covered with wood chips and plywood while heavy construction took place. We wanted to be sure not to damage or compact the roots.”

The deck on which the building is constructed is massive. Three large 13-inch-by-7-inch glued laminated timbre beams form the foundation, upon which Douglas fir joists, each 4 inches by 12 inches are laid. All “float” 13 feet above the forest floor. From here on up, to its 33-foot tall peak, the tree house is a fairly conventional stick frame build.

“The only differences are the corrugated steel structure of the wall around the big window, to stop deflection, and the fact that we used screws instead of nails so that they wouldn’t pop due to any unforeseen movement,” Mr. Green says.

Aesthetically, the vibe is all clean, modern lines with a “woodsy” twist. This is where Ms. Green comes into her own. Cedar is the predominant material externally: the deck, penny joint siding and privacy screens for the outdoor shower, all hewn from the hard wearing wood. Invisible glass handrails border the deck, giving a real sense of being truly among the trees. Inside, the cool grey of the straw and clay floor – a super environmentally friendly product, laid by a local artisan – is complimented by Baltic birch plywood paneled walls and ceiling.

“Lauren has a great eye for this kind of design. I just do the grunt work,” Mr. Green says with a laugh.

Signature pieces, such as the mini propane stove and ladder to the mezzanine, are black, adhering to a minimal colour pallet informed by the window and door frames. The bathroom, too, is all dark tones; the hexagonal floor tiles and almost mirror-like black wall tiles contrasting nicely with the quirky, black trimmed white enamel sink.

A chunky leather couch and woollen throw rug soften the aesthetic and add a cozy feel to the living space, which will be especially welcome in winter months, when the family is really looking forward to living amidst the snow blanketed forest.

The Greens have managed to successfully turn a life long ambition into a reality, and a burgeoning business opportunity, as their new tree house building company, Fort Treehouse Co., gets off the ground (if you’ll pardon the pun) with the completion of this wonderful build.

As for the couple’s two boys – Arlo, who is two, and Sidney, just weeks old – as they grow up they’ll have the best tree house in town. But, it’s a safe bet that dad will be helping them build their own, something more rough and ready like those from his childhood, soon enough.

Handout

Mark Grenier had barely begun working the door at Knoxville’s Tavern when he heard the stories – and warnings – about one of its owners, Matthew McKnight.

“Guys were telling me about McKnight and to watch out for him,” says Mr. Grenier, who worked as a bouncer at the popular Edmonton country bar from 2014 to 2016. “Like, ‘He’s going to do some greasy things, but there’s nothing really we can do about it because he’s McKnight.’”

Mr. Grenier was one of two former Knoxville’s security employees and several staff members who came forward to The Globe and Mail to talk about their experiences, in the hope it can help make change or protect others from being victimized in the future.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. McKnight, 33, is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for five sexual assaults committed against young women in the Edmonton bar scene between 2010 and 2016. At one point, he was facing 26 charges of sexual and physical assault against 21 women, but went to trial on 13 sexual assault charges involving 13 women. He was found not guilty in eight of the cases.

Reaction to the high-profile case has continued to roil in the community and on social media since the sentencing last month, with people questioning not only the verdicts and sentence, but also wondering how Mr. McKnight was able to assault so many women over such a lengthy period, and if anything could have been done to stop him sooner. In some cases, former co-workers, employees and even victims are asking whether they could have done more.

He said, they said: inside the trial of Matthew McKnight

How broken systems allowed Matthew McKnight to get away with sexual assault for years

“Everyone knew that Matt was doing something,” says Emily Lloyd, who started working as a “shooter and beer-tub girl” at Knoxville’s in 2013, the week after her 18th birthday. “But none of us knew how to prove it.”

Open this photo in gallery Matthew McKnight's 2016 mug shot. Police handout

Mr. McKnight was, at one time, an extremely powerful figure in the Edmonton bar scene, having made his way up from working on party buses into the management fold of Urban Sparq, a hospitality group that owned a series of popular bars around the city and was expanding across the country, billing itself as “one of North America’s premier hospitality companies.” His influence was never clearer than at Knoxville’s, which he helped build into one of the busiest nightclubs in the city and where he would ultimately become a part owner.

But as Mr. McKnight’s professional influence and success increased, so did stories and concerns about his inappropriate, questionable and, in some cases, assaultive behaviour toward women, including inside Knoxville’s.

“These guys don’t exist in a bubble,” says Kristin Raworth, a sexual assault survivor and advocate who has been tweeting and writing about the case. “They exist in a world that allows them to continue, that allows them to accelerate. Along the road there were probably hundreds of people who saw [problematic behaviour] and didn’t do anything.”

But while it’s clear many people wondered about Mr. McKnight’s interactions with women, knowing what to do about it wasn’t quite so simple. In the youthful bar scene at Knoxville’s, Mr. McKnight was older and significantly more established than most of those around him, and his position with management proved a powerful protection. It was also easy to brush past McKnight’s lewd and lecherous behaviour within the bar’s wildly sexualized atmosphere, and though stories circulated about more serious incidents, nobody knew anything for sure.

Ms. Lloyd says Mr. McKnight said inappropriate things to her on multiple occasions, and also touched and grabbed her. But she was young and inexperienced and, since he was an owner, she didn’t want to upset him and get fired. She says she was warned by several women to stay away from Mr. McKnight, and taking the warnings seriously, did her best to warn other women in return.

“I would go up to girls when I was passing and I would go, ‘Don’t take a drink from him,’” she says. “It was known, but I didn’t know what more I could do other than warn people, because I didn’t have any evidence. And what’s the word of an 18-year-old girl who’s been working there two months?”

In her testimony, the first woman Mr. McKnight was convicted of assaulting said she didn’t come forward after Mr. McKnight raped her in 2010 for the same reasons. She was 19 and new to working in the bar industry, and even then, Mr. McKnight was more prominent and powerful than her. (The night of her assault began at the Oil City Roadhouse, another Urban Sparq bar, in the location that would later become Knoxville’s.)

“I didn’t want to be this one person making these claims and have people pointing fingers at me for whatever reason,” testified the woman, whose name cannot be published because of a court-ordered publication ban. “I guess I didn’t think I was important. I didn’t think people would believe me.”

She said she only came forward later to back up the other women, because she felt “they were more significant than me.”

In the years that followed, Mr. McKnight’s power and influence continued to grow.

By the time he was arrested in August, 2016, Mr. McKnight was so central a figure at Knoxville’s that former employees describe a special VIP room known as “Matty’s playroom” that was guarded by security and off-limits to everyone except Mr. McKnight and the Edmonton Oilers. They say it had a beaded curtain, leather couches, its own fridge stocked with alcohol and, on one wall, a custom floor-to-ceiling mural of actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman.

“The biggest thing about the bar industry is that you can do whatever you want as long as you’re bringing people in,” says Mr. Grenier, who has since left the industry. “Matt brings people in. My job is to kick people out. So he’s going to win. In the bar industry, unfortunately, that’s how it works. If you are bringing people in, if you are making the club money, you win.”

In an e-mailed statement, the general manager of Knoxville’s at the time, Marty Melnychuk, declined knowledge of any incidents involving Mr. McKnight’s treatment of women at Knoxville’s, including multiple incidents of groping that were described to The Globe and Mail by other former employees.

“I am not aware of these in the bar that I ran,” wrote Mr. Melnychuk.

Mr. Melnychuk, who was also part of the Urban Sparq ownership group, says he does “not support Mr. McKnight’s personal actions or crimes whatsoever,” and now says he regrets writing a glowing letter of reference for Mr. McKnight’s sentencing, in which he describes Mr. McKnight as “one of the best people I have worked with in over a decade in the hospitality industry.”

“If anyone could possibly learn from this experience and go on to become a positive contributing member of the community, it’s Matt,” he wrote in the letter dated June 15, 2020, to the judge considering Mr. McKnight’s sentence. “I humbly ask that you give him a chance to do so.”

Mr. Melnychuk did not respond to further requests for comment.

The website for Urban Sparq is now blank, and it’s not clear whether the ownership group still exists. Knoxville’s is closed and out of business.

Andrew Cormier, who was at one time head of security at Knoxville’s, says he recalls at least a dozen confrontations and incidents between Mr. McKnight and female patrons. In each case, Mr. Cormier says security personnel were expected to kick the women out the bar, with no debate.

He says in one incident, in which Mr. McKnight dumped a milkshake over a woman’s head, there was a meeting with managers, and Mr. McKnight was forced to apologize to Mr. Cormier for causing problems for security. But in other cases, no follow-up occurred.

“He was a part owner, as we were told all the time, so we’d treat him as an owner. It’s his establishment, right? So if he needs you removed, you gotta go,” Mr. Cormier says. “Whether we thought it was legitimate or not, she was leaving. There was no talking to other managers, like, ‘Hey this is a bad call.’ There was none of that. It was just, no, they gotta go, and that was the end of it. We never talked about it ever again.”

He says he heard rumours about more serious incidents outside the club, but didn’t know it was anything more until the charges were laid. If he’d known, Mr. Cormier says, “I would have gone right to the cops.”

Mr. Grenier says he wishes he “dug a little deeper” into the rumours about Mr. McKnight’s behaviour or had spoken up more, even if it meant losing his job. He also wonders if he should have mentioned the rumours to the beat cops in the area, even though he didn’t have anything solid.

“I feel kind of sick about it,” Mr. Grenier says.

Both Mr. Cormier and Mr. Grenier say they’re speaking out in the hope something positive can come from it.

Among those looking back at what transpired is one of the women Mr. McKnight was accused of raping, who says she, too, is questioning whether she did enough. “What’s mainly on my mind is how to protect other women and make sure this never happens again, especially for as long as it did,” says the woman, who has been speaking and tweeting about the case but cannot be identified by The Globe and Mail because her name remains under a court-ordered publication ban.

The woman, who went forward to police after the other charges became public in 2016, says she “basically begged” the Crown not to proceed with her charge before the preliminary hearing, because she was suicidal at the time.

But she says she’s struggled with how the trial might have changed if her charge went ahead with the others, and her feelings are motivating her to speak out on behalf of victims who can’t or don’t want to address it publicly.

“I almost feel like it’s my responsibility to the other girls to say something. I just feel like I need to do it for them,” she says. “I think what I’m doing now is me desperately trying to make up for not doing more earlier.”

Nina Simone once answered, “I’ll tell you what freedom is to me. No fear.” Freedom from fear is the ultimate goal of Black people around the world. It is enshrined in The Universal Declaration of Human Rights. And yet, there is the fear that you feel on the streets as a Black person. The fear that the failure to “tone down your Blackness” will get you killed by the police, or neglected by a doctor, or denied housing by a landlord.

And then there is the fear that you feel every day on the job as a Black person – the fear that if you bring your full Black selves into the workplace, not only will you be rejected, but you will be fired. It is an insidious fear that leads to greater economic inequality, precarious employment and the continuation of systemic racism.

Over the past few weeks, Black employees and business owners across Canada have described the fears that come with bringing Blackness into their workplaces. It has not been a conversation everyone wants to have. As the CBC personality and cultural commentator Amanda Parris recently wrote: “If history has taught us anything, it’s that Canadian institutions and companies do not welcome the truth when it comes to the realities of systemic racism. They often do one of two things in response: 1) they systematically shut down those who disrupt the status quo, or 2) they symbolically acquiesce, but make only surface-level changes.”

Fortunately, this has not been my experience at OCAD University, where I am the first Black, and Black female, dean of a faculty of design – not just at OCAD U, but anywhere. And rather than seeing this anomaly as an example of tokenism – or supertokenism, as the utility of my exceptional talents are designed to overcome the institutional aversion to my presence as a Black cis-gendered woman within systems of white supremacy – what is happening at OCAD University is a possible model for other institutions to mimic to ensure enough Black representation that people feel free to be Black.

OCAD University is achieving a critical mass of Black employees at effective levels to transform the institution. It’s not just talk, but action. Here’s how to do it: Like OCAD U, institutions need to think about hiring Black employees in “sets of three” and entrusting them with power at the top level, influence in the middle level and growth at the entry level.

My school recently announced a successful Black Cluster Hire of five full-time Black faculty in Design – its first in 144 years, which is both thrilling and shameful. This was achievable because OCAD U had established critical mass in the sets of three. At the entry level, Black students consistently advocated for faculty who represented their lived experiences so that they could grow. At the middle level, professors, such as Lillian Allen and Andrea Fatona, wielded great influence on the institution through their activism and scholarship. They also served on the hiring committees to influence decisions, including the one to hire me. It took 144 years because the institution needed someone at the top with power. Nearly four years ago, I was hired as a (Black) dean with the real power to determine and negotiate faculty budgets, write position descriptions, support Black community initiatives and redesign the qualifications standards to account for systemic exclusion.

Many big and small freedoms in being Black are possible because we have built critical mass by turning five full-time Black faculty into 10. This also adds to our complement of Black administrative staff, who are represented in the president’s and provost’s offices, within facilities, the library, IT and student services.

Another positive development was the Speak to Power student forums we held not long ago. Black students overcame their fears to share with the new president, Ana Serrano, and the leadership team at OCAD U all the ways in which the institution has failed them by not supporting their lived experiences of Blackness in their education.

What do I mean by “big and small freedoms in being Black?” Those freedoms manifest themselves in wearing our hair in locs or braids, dressing in Kente cloth or Trinidadian tricolours, bringing jollof or patties to a potluck, and openly saying Black lives matter and having colleagues agree.

Many institutions have declared the intent to hire more Black employees. These declarations are welcome, but intention is just the first step. Black employees must be hired in numbers – think in multiple sets of three – and entrusted with power, influence and growth. Companies and institutions that do this will only benefit. We perform miracles when free from the fear to be Black.

The sky turned orange before filling with heavy white smoke above John Green’s home in British Columbia’s Okanagan region Tuesday afternoon.

He was among hundreds of people ordered to immediately evacuate from the Heritage Hills area near the community of Okanagan Falls as a rapidly growing wildfire threatened the residential neighbourhood.

The fire on Christie Mountain was among nearly 100 that have ignited in the past few days following a heat wave and thunderstorms in southern B.C.

Green described the scene as he packed boxes and greeted friends who arrived to pick up his pets.

“Now it’s really, really, really heavy white. It’s like, take clouds and times it by 10 for how vibrant they are,” he said, looking out from his deck.

The Regional District of Okanagan Similkameen’s emergency operations centre issued the evacuation order to 319 properties.

Firefighters and air tankers had begun attacking the fire on Christie Mountain, on the east side of Skaha Lake about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, the BC Wildfire Service said.

The fire was burning in difficult, rocky sloped terrain that made it difficult for ground crews to access. Early reports indicated it was an active surface fire with an organized flame front, the service said.

The fire was estimated at 250 hectares early Tuesday evening but the service warned that figure was likely to rise.

“We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,” the service said in a tweet.

The evacuation order asked residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with critical items like medication and eye glasses only if they were immediately available, and to register at muster point in Penticton.

British Columbia’s Interior has seen record wildfires in recent years, so Green said he was prepared with emergency boxes ready. He said residents had expressed gratitude that amid a year of tragedy, B.C. had thus far avoided major wildfires until now.

“We were very thankful we didn’t have forest fires this year on top of COVID so this is pretty devastating for most people and especially people who are a lot closer to where their houses may be in danger,” he said.

At the same time, he said he had received 50-odd calls and texts from friends offering to help, so the community was coming together.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a “fire of note” on Tuesday.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was considered out of control but smouldered with no open flame. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight. Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning, after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions. Two were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said."

The Montreal Canadiens could seemingly do no wrong Friday night.

They scored early and often in a 5-0 demolition of the Flyers that saw star goalie Carter Hart chased from Philadelphia’s crease in a mercy pull.

That was then. And for Canadiens fans, it probably feels like a lifetime ago.

Story continues below advertisement

Now after two anemic offensive performances, Montreal is on the cusp of having its playoff bubble burst.

Hart made 29 saves for his second straight shutout as the Flyers smothered the Canadiens for the second time in less than 48 hours to pick up a 2-0 victory Tuesday and grab a 3-1 stranglehold on their first-round series.

Montreal — which played that near-perfect Game 2 to even the matchup 1-1 — was bested by Hart’s 23 saves, 24 blocked shots, three posts and two crossbars in Sunday’s 1-0 loss. It was more of the same Tuesday for a team that has now been blanked for 129 minutes 25 seconds dating back to Jesperi Kotkaniemi’s goal midway through Friday’s third period.

“Our backs are against the wall,” said Canadiens captain Shea Weber, whose team will look to avoid elimination in Wednesday’s Game 5. “We’ve got to take our lumps here and correct a few things.

“[We’ve] definitely got to come with our best effort.”

That effort wasn’t there at times Tuesday as the Flyers once again scored early and then locked things down. A bad goal on Carey Price, who finished with 20 saves, late in the second period forged a lead that felt insurmountable.

“We just have to put this behind us,” Montreal winger Tomas Tatar said. “It’s not pretty when you don’t score for two games.”

Michael Raffl and Philippe Myers provided the offence for Philadelphia, the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference.

“Everybody’s just committed to winning right now, and battling hard,” said Hart, a netminder of few words.

Searching for any type of spark in what would be another fruitless third period, Canadiens interim head coach Kirk Muller put his lines in a blender, benching Brendan Gallagher and Jonathan Drouin for long stretches.

Montreal’s leading scorer the past three years, Gallagher has failed to find the net in the postseason despite coming in with a league-high 31 shots.

“[The frustration’s] there. You just have to do your best to fight that urge,” he said. “You play for one reason — you play for teammates. Regardless of what’s happened, I’ve got to find a way here, and whenever you’re out on the ice just take advantage of it. I guess if the coach feels other guys are going to do the job better than you, that’s his job.

“It doesn’t mean I sit there and accept it, but my job is to play.”

The 24th of 24 teams included in the NHL’s resumption to its pandemic-delayed season, the Canadiens haven’t helped themselves much over the last two games.

And Price, who’s been mostly brilliant in this series and in Montreal’s stunning upset of the Pittsburgh Penguins in the qualifying round, wore the goat horns with his team behind and struggling to create Tuesday.

Up 1-0 after the opening 20 minutes, the Flyers doubled their lead with 2:56 left in the second when Myers’ shot from the sideboards clipped the stick of Montreal defenceman Brett Kulak, skipped off the ice and handcuffed Price.

“That was the break that we needed,” Muller said. “You’ve got to score some goals to win hockey games.

“But that was unfortunate.”

The Flyers continued the trend of stifling the Canadiens earlier in the period, allowing next to no room through the neutral zone. Montreal did have an opportunity when Joel Armia couldn’t connect on Hart’s doorstep before Kulak pinched down for another chance.

Jeff Petry then blasted a point shot that the Philadelphia netminder just got a piece of before it chimed off the post inside an empty Scotiabank Arena.

Montreal got a power play with 6:42 left in regulation, but Hart, who has made 52 straight saves after allowing four goals on 26 shots in Game 2, stopped Nick Suzuki and flopped onto rebound.

The Canadiens then got an unlucky delay-of-game penalty, and the Flyers coasted from there, improving to 35-0-2 in 2019-20 when leading after two periods.

“We’re not playing perfect hockey,” Philadelphia head coach Alain Vigneault said. “When we do make mistakes, (Hart’s) been able to get that big save.”

The Canadiens, who were 18 points behind the Flyers in the standings when the NHL halted its season in March because of COVID-19, have allowed just five goals in the series, but now find themselves pushed to the brink.

“We’ve seen exceptional goaltending in these playoffs,” Muller said. “The one thing you can’t do is get let a goalie get into your head. It doesn’t always take a perfect shot to score.”

As in Game 3, Philadelphia again pushed ahead early in the first when Raffl worked a nifty give-and-go with Sean Couturier following a Montreal turnover before roofing his second at 6:32 on Price, who looked slightly out of position.

“These are all tight games,” said Raffl, who returned to the lineup Sunday after getting hurt Aug. 2. “To get the lead, it boosts everyone’s confidence. Then we were just committed to finishing it off.”

Couturier had a great chance to put his team up by two on a power play later in the period, but flubbed his shot at a wide-open net. Byron then saw a similar opportunity go over Hart’s goal after Flyers defenceman Ivan Provorov got a stick on his effort.

Montreal nearly got an unlikely equalizer from its fourth line, but Alex Belzile fired high on a 2-on-1.

“I feel like once we get one, it’ll just started rolling,” Tatar said. “Just be a little more hungrier on the net. It’s not over until it’s over.

“We will regroup.”

If they don’t, the Canadiens will be heading home Thursday."

Matt York/The Associated Press

Kim Reem recounted Tuesday how the unusually powerful storm that tore through Iowa last week destroyed her Cedar Rapids home and laid waste to more than 100 large trees on her property.

During a briefing at the airport in Iowa’s second-largest city, Reem, who heads a local homeless shelter, told President Donald Trump that it would cost roughly a quarter of a million dollars to clear the trees from her land because that damage wasn’t covered by insurance – leading Trump to express surprise.

Reem said the people staying at her Mission of Hope shelter are “hungry for compassion from our leaders. Just to know our leaders care.” And she said people are generally worn down by the coronavirus pandemic that left many without work. Some had just returned to their jobs only to be idled again by the Aug. 10 storm.

“We’re strong and resilient, but Mr. President, we are tired and we need your help,” she said.

Eight days after the storm, a rare derecho, raked the state with hurricane-strength winds, thousands are still picking through the pieces of broken homes and hauling fallen trees and other debris from their properties. About 40,000 customers still don’t have power, and a group of African refugees was living in tents outside of their decimated apartment building, initially refusing to leave despite the pleas of human services workers.

Cedar Rapids, which is in eastern Iowa, was hardest hit and drew the attention of Trump, who promised to approve a request for $180 million in aid for damaged homes and infrastructure in the state. He also promised additional funding for farmers who were affected by an unusually powerful storm that tore through the state last week.

During the Tuesday briefing, local officials and homeowners spoke of the devastation to their communities, including Marion Mayor Nick AbouAssaly, who said up to 95% of the homes and businesses in his city of 40,000 northeast of Cedar Rapids were damaged.

On Monday, Trump signed a portion of Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds’ disaster relief request that covers extensive debris removal and repairs to public buildings, streets and bridges in 16 counties. That portion of the request totalled about $45 million.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency, however, is still assessing the governor’s individual assistance request, which includes $100 million in damage to private utilities and $82.7 million in damage to homes, according to early state estimates. In additional, farmers sustained an estimated $2.7 billion in damage to crops, grain storage and buildings, which is part of the declaration and would likely be covered under various U.S. Department of Agriculture programs. The individual assistance request covers 27 counties.

Trump indicated Monday that he had signed the state’s disaster aid request in full, but he had not approved the individual assistance, which makes up the largest portion of the $3.99 billion aid request.

Reynolds on Monday thanked Trump for his approval but didn’t acknowledge that the bulk of the state’s request was pending. The partial funding approval was later acknowledged during Tuesday’s meeting.

The governor’s spokesman didn’t respond to a message seeking comment.

Cedar Rapids Mayor Brad Hart told Trump the individual portion is important to help homeowners remove trees, which in many cases will cost thousands of dollars and isn’t covered by insurance. He said an estimated 60,000 homes in Cedar Rapids have some degree of damage.

“Adding the individual assistance component to the disaster declaration would really help so many people get those trees out of their yards and not have such a financial burden to them,” he said.

Reynolds pointed out to Trump that the individual assistance was part of the state’s declaration and that FEMA and the state were working on gathering the damage estimates. “We should be able to do that in a short amount of time,” she said.

FEMA spokesman Mike Cappannari said the assessment for the individual assistance portion of the declaration was under way.

“It’s not uncommon across the country for the governor to make a request for a preliminary damage assessment, public assistance and individual assistance and a portion of it is approved just to start the flow of federal resources to get that process going,” he said.

Trump assured Reynolds and others that he would get the individual aid approved.

“We’ll get it taken care of. We’ll get it done very quickly,” he said.

Concerns have been voiced since the storm that the nation hasn’t understood the extent of damage to Iowa, which Reynolds described as “basically a 40-mile-wide tornado with 112 mph winds.”

The National Weather Service said the derecho packed intermittent wind in eastern Iowa in the 110-130 mph range. That would be the strength of an EF2 tornado. The storm “destroyed or damaged numerous outbuildings, barns, grain bins, homes, mobile homes, apartment buildings, trees and power poles,” the weather service said.

“The rest of the country is starting to take note, and so we’re getting volunteers and help from around the country, and that’s really important,” Hart said.

Trump at one point turned to White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany and asked if the world was aware of what happened in Iowa. She replied that it was now because he was in the state and the media had accompanied him to report on the disaster.

Anthony. At right is first lady Melania Trump. ANNA MONEYMAKER/The New York Times News Service

As the U.S. marks the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage, many event organizers, mindful that the 19th Amendment originally benefited mostly white women, have been careful to present it as a commemoration, not a celebration.

The amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified on Aug. 18, 1920, but many women of colour were prevented from casting ballots for decades afterward because of poll taxes, literacy tests, overt racism, intimidation and laws that prevented the grandchildren of slaves from voting. Much of that didn’t change until the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

From exhibits inside the Arizona Capitol Museum to a gathering on the North Carolina State Capitol lawn, many commemorations, including those that moved online because of the coronavirus pandemic, have highlighted a more nuanced history of the American women’s suffrage movement alongside the traditional tributes to well-known suffragists such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.

The 100th anniversary has arrived during a year of nationwide protests against racial inequality that have forced the United States to once again reckon with its uncomfortable history.

“Like many movements, the stories are complicated and I think it’s important, as we have an opportunity to reflect and to celebrate, that we also are honest about how we didn’t meet all of our aspirations,” said Rhode Island Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, a Democrat born and raised in Puerto Rico who has helped to organize her state’s suffrage commemoration efforts. “It’s important to have these conversations so we can do a better job of going forward.”

The Connecticut Historical Society last month unveiled an online exhibit titled The Work Must Be Done: Women of Color and the Right to Vote. It highlights Black women from Connecticut who fought for suffrage rights, as well as other issues, such as anti-discrimination, anti-lynching, labour reforms and access to education.

“We have really been wanting to make sure we talk about the complicated history of these issues in our country,” said Arizona assistant secretary of state Allie Bones, whose office came up with a program after working with about 60 community groups across the state, many of which were “very focused on not calling it a celebration, but … a commemoration.”

The complicated nature of the suffrage movement came full circle last week when Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden chose California Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, making her the first Black woman on a major party ticket.

In an appearance with Mr. Biden last week, Ms. Harris said she was “mindful of all the heroic and ambitious women before me whose sacrifice, determination and resilience makes my presence here today even possible.”

While their names are not as well known as the white suffragists, Black women played both prominent and smaller roles in the movement. Sojourner Truth, an emancipated slave, who died in 1883, is considered one of the first known Black suffragists. She travelled throughout the U.S. speaking at women’s rights conventions and suffrage events, including at the Akron, Ohio, women’s convention in 1851 where she was credited with giving a powerful speech that’s been remembered as “Ain’t I a Woman?” Some historians, however, have questioned the wording.

Through the years, there were many prominent Black abolitionists and suffragists who worked in their own women’s clubs and suffrage organizations and sometimes side by side with white suffragists, often working for both voting rights and civil rights.

The young founding members of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority participated in the 1913 suffrage march in Washington in their first public act. The Howard University students took great personal risk and were not welcomed by some white suffragists who ultimately insisted the Black women march at the end of the procession, said Cheryl Hickmon, national first vice-president of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc.

“They felt that it was their obligation, if you will, even though it was unsafe to march with the other women and show their dissension and feelings,” said Ms. Hickmon, whose organization has been working with organizers of the Turning Point Suffragist Memorial that’s being constructed in southern Fairfax County, Va., and includes an overview of the entire movement, including Black suffragists.

The 100th anniversary marks an opportunity to “honestly examine” the relationship between white and Black women in the women’s rights movement, said Johnetta Betch Cole, a former college president and anthropologist who is currently the national chair of the National Conference of Negro Women, an organization that was founded in 1935 to advocate for women’s rights.

“There is more acknowledgment of the complexities of the strains, of the racism in the suffrage movement than ever, ever before,” Ms. Betch Cole said. “Unfortunately, one can be virtuous in one form of oppression and then turn around and victimize others on another basis.”

In June, protesters in Iowa demanded that Iowa State University remove the name of suffragist and alumna Carrie Chapman Catt from a building because of white supremacist and anti-immigrant statements attributed to her.

Doris Kelley, a former Democratic Iowa House representative who chairs the state’s 19th Amendment Centennial Commemoration, said it’s important to remember the historical context that suffragists navigated while acknowledging the movement’s complexities. The logo of Iowa’s centennial commemoration “Hard Won, Not Done,” Ms. Kelley said, is a nod to that unfinished history.

In North Carolina, Janice Jones Schroeder, a member of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, said she was impressed that organizers of the state’s suffrage anniversary activities thought to include her in a commemoration event last September on the lawn of the Statehouse.

“At that time, American Indians were not even considered citizens of the United States,” she said. While the Snyder Act of 1924 admitted Native Americans born in the U.S. to full U.S. citizenship, it was left up to the states to decide who had the right to vote, and it took more than 40 years for all 50 states to agree to grant them voting rights.

Ms. Schroeder said there are still challenges today for tribal members who want to vote, including voter ID laws, long distances to register to vote on some reservations, lack of access to mail and socioeconomic disparities.

Women of colour in Black, Latino and other communities face similar barriers, making the anniversary of the 19th Amendment and the ensuing decades-long fight all the more relevant a century later in a high-stakes election year.

“I look at politics now,” Ms. Schroeder said, “and I think, `Do we still have a voice?‘”

Senate Republican leaders are preparing a slimmed-down coronavirus relief package of roughly $500-billion that will include extended payments for unemployed people and smaller businesses, a GOP senator said Tuesday.

The measure will also include $10-billion for the embattled Postal Service, said one top GOP aide. The agency has become the focus of a campaign-season battle over whether it will have enough resources to handle an expected flood of mail-in ballots for this November’s presidential and congressional elections.

The fight between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats over weathering the pandemic has become a critical battle that’s highlighted Trump’s troubled handling of an outbreak that has killed over 170,000 Americans, cost tens of millions of jobs and shuttered businesses in virtually every community.

It’s also focused recently on newly imposed cuts in Postal Service operations that critics say are aimed at curtailing the agency’s ability to deliver mail-in votes in time for them to be counted this November. That has coincided with Trump’s repeated insistence, without foundation, that expected record levels of mail-in votes by people eager to avoid polling places will lead to widespread fraud in the elections.

Under intense public and political pressure, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said Tuesday that he would withhold some of the operational changes he has begun to impose, like the removal of mailboxes, until after the elections.

Negotiations over a far larger coronavirus relief bill are expected to resume after Labor Day between the White House and top congressional Democrats.

“I’m hoping that we actually can get back together, and in spite of the proximity to the election, put it aside and reach an agreement some time soon,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday in Manchester, Kentucky.

With Democrats demanding that bargainers piece together a wide-ranging measure, the trimmer package emerging from McConnell and other top Republicans seems to be an effort to show voters what the GOP would favour enacting quickly. With the party’s presidential convention next week, the measure could give Republican senators facing difficult re-election races this fall an opportunity to vote for a relief measure with popular provisions, even though it would probably be blocked by Democrats demanding a more generous bill.

The GOP package was also taking shape as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has summoned the House to return to Washington for an unusual Saturday vote to provide $25 billion for the Postal Service and to block changes in the way it operates.

Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., a member of the Senate Republican leadership, said the emerging legislation will provide $300 weekly in extra federal payments for unemployed people above the state payments that beneficiaries receive. He said he believes the extra payments would run through 2020.

Story continues below advertisement

A massive relief bill approved earlier this year provided $600 extra per week, but those payments expired at the end of July. Democrats want to continue the added $600 in payments, but Trump and congressional Republicans have pushed for less.

Blunt said the trimmed-down measure would also have money for schools to cope with the coronavirus pandemic and for businesses struggling to stay open and retain employees during the staggering recession.

A second GOP Senate aide said the new proposal includes $105 billion for education.

That aide said the plan also has $16 billion for virus testing and $29 billion for developing vaccines, manufacturing treatment and other initiatives aimed at conquering a virus that has killed more than 170,000 Americans and infected more than 5 million this year.

The bill does not include a renewal of the one-time direct payments of up to $1,200 for taxpayers and dependants that were part of early legislation aimed at providing relief to people as the economy slowed to a near halt.

The Democratic-led House approved a $3 trillion relief plan in May, while Senate Republicans offered a $1 trillion package. In negotiations between Democrats and the White House that dissolved in bitterness earlier this month, Democrats dropped their proposal to $2 trillion and asked Republicans to meet them at that halfway point, but that has not happened.

The two GOP aides spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the legislation publicly.

Grappling for votes – and the spotlight – as Democrats hold their national convention, President Donald Trump targeted voters in key states and constituencies Tuesday and promised a pardon for Susan B. Anthony, a leader in the women’s suffrage movement.

Trump flew to Arizona, one of the top 2020 battleground states, to press his case against his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, painting him as radically left in one of his harshest broadsides yet of the campaign.

“The Biden plan would unleash a flood of illegal immigration like the world has never seen before – it would be a torrent of biblical proportions,” Trump was to say, as he prepared to accept the endorsement of the National Border Patrol Council. “Biden’s plan is the most radical, extreme, reckless, dangerous and deadly immigration plan ever put forward by a major party candidate.”

With his second trip in two days, Trump was hoping to mitigate a convention polling bump for his rival and to shore up support by contrasting his position with Biden’s on immigration, one of the most important issues to his political base. He was also trying to stanch an erosion in support among female voters with a symbolic nod on the centennial of the ratification of the 19th Amendment.

In recent weeks, Trump has been trying to build support within the pivotal female voter constituency and has stepped up his events aimed at women. His campaign has launched a “women for Trump” bus tour, and the president has embraced a “law and order” message with renewed vigour.

The president worked in a last-minute stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, for a briefing about damage from the derecho last week that has left thousands without power and caused catastrophic damage across the battleground state. Many there have expressed outrage that their plight has not received more national attention.

The storm, which packed 100 mph winds and similar power to an inland hurricane, swept across the Midwest last week, blowing down trees, flipping vehicles and causing widespread damage.

“We’ve come through for you, and we will always come through for Iowa,” Trump said, as the city’s mayor urged him to consider enhanced federal disaster funding for people there.

Trump aimed to highlight his immigration agenda in Yuma, Arizona, and receive an update on construction of his southern border wall, making his second trip to the city in two months. It was an effort to highlight his work to deliver on a key 2016 campaign pledge.

“MS-13 is on the run, many of its leaders are behind bars, and we are deporting its members in record numbers,” Trump was to say. “But if Biden wins, it will be giant jailbreak for MS-13 and vicious criminal gangs. My administration is the only thing standing between the American people and these deadly criminals.”

Before leaving Washington, Trump held a White House event to announce the pardon of Anthony, convicted of voting in 1872 in violation of laws permitting only men to vote. But he quickly pivoted to the upcoming election and the issue of voting by mail.

“Win, lose or draw, we have to get it right,” Trump said of the November vote count, levelling a fresh offensive against mail-in voting.

“You can’t have millions and millions of ballots sent all over the place, sent to people that are dead, sent to dogs, cats, sent everywhere,” Trump said.

In fact, voter fraud has proved exceedingly rare. The Brennan Center for Justice in 2017 ranked the risk of ballot fraud at 0.00004% to 0.0009%, based on studies of past elections.

Only nine states have plans for “universal” mail-in voting, in which ballots are sent automatically to registered voters. Five of those states relied on mail-in ballots even before the coronavirus pandemic raised concerns about voting in person.

Trump’s pardon announcement came on the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which ensured women the right to vote. The amendment states, “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.” Congress passed it in 1919, and the amendment was ratified on Aug. 18, 1920.

Anthony was arrested for voting in Rochester, New York, and convicted in a widely publicized trial. Although she refused to pay the fine, the authorities declined to take further action.

“She felt the trial was the greatest miscarriage of justice because she had not had an opportunity to have a jury of her peers, and the jury didn’t get to vote,” according to Deborah L. Hughes, president and CEO of The National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House in Rochester, where Anthony died in 1906.

“So to pardon her is to validate the trial, and she would not buy that idea at all,” Hughes said.

Hughes said the question to ask on the anniversary is how she would want to be honoured.

“She would be the first to say if any president wanted to honour her, the best way to do that is to make sure there is no voter suppression anywhere in the United States,” Hughes said.

Before leaving Washington, the president laced into former first lady Michelle Obama – one of the most popular figures in American politics – for her convention speech in which she said Trump was “in over his head” and urged voters to turn out en masse to remove the “wrong president for our country.”

Trump responded at a White House event, saying it was Mrs. Obama who was in “over her head” and calling her remarks “divisive.”

Preparations for Trump’s own acceptance speech next week were under way at the White House. The South Lawn was filled with scaffolding and equipment that would be needed for what would appear to be a rather large stage.

As was the case Monday in Minneapolis and Wisconsin, Trump’s schedule Tuesday did not show him venturing beyond the airports in Iowa or Arizona – a reflection of the new realities of campaigning in the midst of a pandemic. Instead, Trump has been delivering speeches that have had the feel of small outdoor rallies in airport hangars, often flouting recommendations against large gatherings and mask-wearing.

Trump is set to travel to Pennsylvania on Thursday, visiting an important battleground – and the state of Biden’s birth – ahead of his opponent’s acceptance speech.

Podcasting has been a boon for fans of theatre, and now, with stages closed down because of health regulations associated with COVID-19, storytelling serials are a lifeline. These three podcasts arrive just in time for those jonesing for drama.

Metamorphosis – A Viral Trilogy: From the Giller-winning author André Alexis comes a pandemic-inspired audio drama in three parts, directed by Ross Manson. The first instalment is Lucretia in Quarantine, in which a young teenager (voiced by Bahia Watson) documents her motherless, near feral existence in a daily journal. It’s a poignant story of fear, family and survival, involving the adoption of a baby raccoon. In an allegory for these weird times, the lines between human and animal are blurred: A confused “pet” shrieks; its unprepared caretaker is just as scared. “I wonder what it would be like,” Lucretia says, “if you had to remember you were human.” The trilogy is presented by Volcano Theatre, TO Live, Canadian Stage and SummerWorks theatre festival, with new episodes dropping Aug. 24 and 31.

Playing On Air: This continuing American radio and podcast series was launched in 2012 to present short plays – a preferred form of many playwrights because of the pithy dramatic possibilities, and yet they are rarely performed professionally outside of theatre festivals. Though the Playing On Air productions are bite-sized, they’re not short on big names, with actors Ed Asner, Elizabeth Ashley, Adam Driver, Kathleen Turner and Jesse Eisenberg being just a few of the A-listers on board for these stripped-down performances. A new season comes this fall, but meanwhile Playing On Air is re-releasing a few old episodes, including Happy by Alan Zweibel of Saturday Night Live, It’s Garry Shandling’s Show and Curb Your Enthusiasm fame. Taped in front of a live audience, Happy stars Frankie Faison and Scott Adsit in a delightful curve-balling comedy about a New York Mets fan who looks up a former boys-of-summer hero of his.

At the end of each chapter of this spooky six-part taleabout Toronto’s historic (and apparently haunted) Royal Alexandra Theatre, listeners are invited to submit ideas on what should happen next. The backstage story read by actor David Mucci is set in 1959, when the new television fad contributed to a decline in theatre attendance in general and the building of the modern, bigger O’Keefe Centre nearby threatened the Royal Alex’s livelihood in particular. The script comes from Karastamatis, and while he’s no playwright, as a promotion man he knows there’s nothing more frightening than an empty theatre.

Three producers of The Ellen DeGeneres Show have exited amid allegations of a dysfunctional workplace that harboured misbehaviour including sexual misconduct and racially insensitive remarks.

Executive producers Ed Glavin and Kevin Leman and coexecutive producer Jonathan Norman have “parted ways” with the long-running daytime series, a spokesperson for producer Warner Bros. said in a statement Monday.

An internal company investigation of claims about the show was prompted by a BuzzFeed News report in July based on 36 interviews with ex-staffers, who complained about or said they witnessed improper and unfair treatment.

Story continues below advertisement

Most of the allegations were tied to executive producers and senior managers, including Glavin, Leman and Norman, BuzzFeed News said. The people making the claims against them were not identified.

A representative for Leman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. Representatives for Glavin and Norman couldn’t immediately be found.

In statements to BuzzFeed News after the July 30 story was published online, Leman denied “any kind of sexual impropriety” and Norman said he categorically denied the accusations.

DeGeneres informed staff of the shakeup Monday in a video conference call, according to Variety, which first reported the development. She said she found claims about the show’s environment to be “heartbreaking,” the trade publication said, citing unidentified sources.

The comedian and host had sent a memo to her staff after last month’s BuzzFeed article, recalling her early promise of ensuring a workplace where “everyone would be treated with respect.” Something changed, she said, “and for that, I am sorry.”

The show debuted in 2003.

In a separate July statement, Warner Bros. said parent company WarnerMedia’s investigation revealed what it called “some flaws in the show’s daily management.”

Story continues below advertisement

Although not all of the allegations were corroborated, the studio said it was “disappointed that the primary findings of the investigation indicated some deficiencies related to the show’s day-to-day management.”

No details were specified at the time, and Warner Bros. had no further comment Monday beyond confirming the producers’ departures.

The summer of COVID-19 has been screen-soaked. From virtual camps and online summer school to chatting with friends and engaging in endless hours of gaming, the onslaught of screens on children has been relentless and, to a large extent, unavoidable.

But come September, when the new school year begins, tech habits will need to be recalibrated. “This is a great time to rewire our kids’ brains and create new healthy pathways for the use of technology,” says Dr. Shimi Kang, addiction psychiatrist, speaker and author of The Tech Solution. “Take food, for instance. In the beginning of the pandemic, we let go a little – stress eating, snacking, etc. – but quickly realized that this is not sustainable, that it is unhealthy for us in the long run. Similarly, after having loosened up on the rules around technology and screen time, we now need to scale back the use of junk tech, especially by our kids.”

In her book, she cites examples from sessions with her own patients and explains how screen consumption affects adolescent brains. She also offers practical strategies that parents and caregivers of children can adopt to augment the benefits of good tech. “Parents always talk about setting time limits for tech usage or banning tech for long periods of time. This simply won’t work, more so now since tech has completely embedded our lives. We need to move from screen time to screen quality. We need to understand what screen consumption is doing to us at a biological level, to our brains and bodies,” she says.

Kang outlines a plan that aims to rebalance tech consumption using the metaphor of a diet. The steps involve motivating your child to make a change in their tech habits, guiding them through the process and finally taking inventory and celebrating their efforts. But Kang acknowledges that every family will respond to the strategy differently based on its unique challenges.

“In general, it takes a certain amount of time – 21 to 90 days – to change our habits … the science differs. The point is to establish an understanding that it takes time to move off certain neuro-trails, rewire our brains and move on to healthier habits. Change is a process. We know that when we are making a behavioural change, the first response is to be in denial. Then with more information, we start to contemplate that maybe there are benefits to this change, we then prepare for change, implement it, we also relapse but then get back,” she says.

Here are Kang’s top strategies from The Tech Solution.

Talk to kids about toxic tech

Just like you talk to your child about the benefits of healthy food for their bodies and minds, speak to them about how the kind of tech they consume affects the way they feel and behave. Engaging negatively on social media, sexting, constantly looking for online validation from peers and cyberbullying are all examples of toxic tech and need to be dealt with firmly. “We block all potential gambling and pornography sites, and with our older kids I frequently check in and discuss the toxicity of FOMO, online comparisons and unintentional multitasking,” says Kang.

Limit junk tech

Scrolling mindlessly on Snapchat or constantly checking likes on Instagram are classic examples of indulging in junk tech. “When it comes to tech, there is no regulation around it. On one side of the screen is a child’s brain, which is underdeveloped ... the other side of the screen is the most sophisticated neuroscience known to us. The persuasive design of the platforms, apps and devices we use are intended to capture their attention and keep it. I suggest that parents discuss, limit and monitor video games and social media until their child seems able to regulate their own use of it,” says Kang. For parents of kids with learning differences and vulnerabilities, there’s co-morbidities like anxiety and depression that are connected to gaming addictions.

Encourage healthy tech

Kids, especially pre-teens and older, crave peer and social connection, indulge in risk-taking behaviours and seek novel experiences. Tech can be used smartly to satisfy all these propensities. “Teachers and parents will have to get creative with the tasks they assign to them – getting them to take risks and learn new things, write an essay in a different way, create a video project using tech, there’s so much that technology can do from an innovation standpoint. With healthy tech you allow yourself to care, make meaningful connections with people and are able to be creative. You can be flexible and let your kids enjoy exploring the world online as long as their time is balanced with other healthy real-life habits,” says Kang.

After years of research and hard work, this summer I was promoted to full professor by Brock University. It’s ironic that this progress for a visible minority happened during the “great pause” of COVID-19, and when society was finally – remarkably – awakened to racism by the killing of George Floyd.

Like a lot of people in these never-before-seen times, I took a long look in the mirror. How could this be happening? I had been in academia for a quarter-century and thought I was making a difference. How to find hope now? Just because I had “made it” in academia? What next?

Incidentally, my research is on brain and language, which means I could be in either linguistics or psychology departments. Out of curiosity, I did a web search of those department types at major Canadian universities. My search revealed that just a handful of full professors at those schools are both female and non-white. That reality alone says, “Houston, we have a problem.”

Words can heal and words can hurt – one minority doctor’s experience

Nevertheless, I do have hope.

July 5 was Gurupurnima, a day in Indian culture that celebrates one’s teachers (a guru is one who removes darkness, or a teacher; Purnima means full moon). My son had just completed a week-long tabla (Indian drum) workshop given by a McGill University music faculty member (online, thanks to COVID-19). The workshop ended with a lovely Gurupurnima ritual, where the instructor patiently explained the significance of each step, such as how to use incense and where to place it.

Here’s the thing: The instructor, Shawn, was not of Indian origin. He explained how to perform the ritual as taught to him by his guru, a renowned virtuoso from India. And there I was, a granddaughter of a Sanskrit guru, learning about this ritual on Zoom. I chuckled on the inside at this beautiful reminder that a unique feature of our human brains (other than our neurocognitive ability to use language) is that we can be flexible with social identity. We can have, and adapt to, more than one. In fact, if we simply (and figuratively) look in our own backyards, we know this to be true. We each have two parents, and so we each have extended family on either side, two groups with whom we likely interact just a bit differently. And yet, we love them equally (for the most part) and are always ourselves with them.

This idea of multiple identities, being able to belong to different tribes, is an important facet of ourselves to remember as we traverse these extraordinary times.

I’ve always been aware of my several cultural identities, thanks to being from Quebec, having parents from India, and studying and working in the U.S. in my 20s. In fact, I would have to say that being aware of my different identities has always helped me navigate difficulty.

But the way in which I was formally introduced to my “other” identity was a bit of shock.

On my first day of kindergarten, my parents sat me down at the kitchen table. Dad (a statistics professor at Sir George Williams University before it became Concordia) looked serious, so I got a little nervous despite still feeling excited about starting school. He said, “Don’t feel bad if you raise your hand and the teacher doesn’t call on you.”

I sat there, puzzled.

“People prefer people who look like them. And you don’t look like your teacher. She will call on the Canadian kids.” (For my parents, “Canadian” meant “white.”)

More bewilderment.

“It’s just human nature. What you have to do is work harder than everyone else, so you can be the best in your class.”

Talk about pressure. And all I wanted was to wear my new cardigan and start school.

“If you are the best in your class, your teacher can’t ignore you. This is Canada. You can make it here – if you work really, really hard. In India,” he said (keep in mind this was the 70s),“it’s about who you know, not how good you are. But not in Canada. Here, you can make it.”

And then, as if we’d just been idly discussing the weather, we walked to school.

Like many kids, I refused to listen to my parents. After all, I’m Canadian! I was born here! Sure, kids at the neighbourhood playground called me racist names, but they were just ignorant kids. As a five-year-old, I was convinced grown-ups would know better and do better.

Today, we are all too familiar with the term “unconscious bias.” Today, we know that, unfortunately, my dad was not entirely wrong. Still, I’m glad I didn’t take his words to heart. If I had, I might have, or would have, or could have seen racism (and its close cousin, sexism) everywhere I went.

The story of George Floyd reminds us that racism is definitely still here. But I’m here, too. I can’t give Mr. Floyd his life back; I can’t return the land my house sits on to the Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabe peoples. But as a professor, I’m at the top of a system (finally), and I have a voice. In the classroom, I will continue to call on students of all shapes and colours and backgrounds. I will continue to speak up, respectfully, when I see or hear things I disagree with, or that are simply incorrect.

And I will remember that our humanity lies in our flexibility. We have the brains for it, and due to the aftermath of George Floyd’s death, we now know we have the heart for it, too.

The Covid-19 pandemic has had at least one positive effect on Richard Myers’s business. Users of Alternawork, his 25,000-square-foot co-working offices in Oakville, Ont., can now safely receive and send packages without signatures or other human interaction.

The pandemic helped with the signature aspect, with many shipping companies and couriers dropping the requirement in order to maintain physical distancing. But “smart lockers” have also been key in allowing them to deliver and securely store packages until office users are ready to pick them up.

Infrared light sensors in the lockers detect when a package is inserted, at which point a notification is sent by text message or e-mail to alert the recipient that there’s mail waiting for them. It works the same in reverse – users can insert packages and let carriers know they’re ready for pickup.

In either case, the recipient scans a QR code or enters a supplied PIN onto a touch screen that then opens their respective locker slot.

These capabilities helped Alternawork, which has a second location in Kelowna, B.C., mitigate the worst months of the pandemic without having to close down, which has been a boon to the enterprise clients who use its offices.

The small company’s experience could be a taste of what’s to come for the larger commercial real estate sector as property managers and developers look to ensure physical distancing in workplaces for the foreseeable future.

“It was perfect because we were able to have package delivery, but touchless,” Mr. Myers says. “That was a big deal for us.”

The smart lockers used by Alternawork are supplied by Snaile, a Mississauga-based company founded in 2015 by serial entrepreneur Patrick Armstrong after Canada Post announced it was planning to end door-to-door delivery and shift to community mailboxes.

The company developed the sensor and notification technology that, when installed inside existing lockers, could save people from making pointless trips to their mailboxes.

But Mr. Armstrong was left without an obvious market after the Liberal government scrapped the conversion plan. He was then approached by private equity real estate investment firm KingSett Capital about developing a full product – the sensor and notification technology, plus the mailboxes themselves.

Snaile has since grown to 14 full-time employees, with smart locker installations in 23 Canadian cities. Property company partners include Oxford and Cadillac Fairview.

Most installations are residential – multifamily apartment buildings and condos – but the company also has a handful of corporate clients, including Alternawork and Ontario Power Generation, which uses Snaile lockers at its downtown Toronto offices on University Avenue.

Mr. Armstrong says he is in talks with a number of commercial property developers, who are now assessing the role that smart lockers can play in a postpandemic world.

Many office tower managers, for example, are looking for ways to decrease the amount of foot traffic in their buildings. Installing smart lockers in lobbies could be one way to do that.

“Everyone is wondering what we are going to do when we go back to work. It’s a fresh problem, it’s going to be a big problem,” he says. “They are trying to limit [mail] carriers running around in the elevators.”

Snaile lockers are accessible by a number of major carriers, including FedEx, Purolator, DHL and Intelcom, one of Amazon’s largest package delivery services in Canada. A notable holdout, however, is Canada Post, with whom Mr. Armstrong is trying to work out a deal.

Canada Post has increased the number of mechanical lockers in residential buildings across the country to more than 11,000, from 9,300 at the end of 2019. Though the lockers don’t have sensors or internet connectivity, package recipients still get email or Canada Post app notifications when a delivery is made.

A spokesperson would not comment on negotiations with Snaile but said the Crown corporation recently underwent a request for proposal process for future parcel locker offerings and is not yet in a position to release details.

Snaile is facing competition in the corporate field, potentially from Canada Post, but also from the likes of Pitney Bowes, which is marketing similar Intelligent Lockers to property managers and developers.

Industry observers say demand for smart lockers in commercial properties was low before the pandemic, but the new reality may indeed change that. Finding space for them in existing buildings could prove problematic, but they are likely to be no-brainers in future developments.

“Keeping couriers out of the building may increasingly become the norm,” says Oliver Tighe, executive managing director of Colliers valuation and advisory services group for the Greater Toronto Area. “For new buildings, it has become a standard feature rather than a unique feature.”

April Franco, associate professor of economics and strategy at the University of Toronto Scarborough, expects there will be a race to install smart lockers among property developers and the companies that supply them.

With limited space, few building managers will want to install more than they have to, similar to utility lines, which means the competition will be fierce. Locker providers that provide ubiquitous interoperability with carriers are likely to have the advantage.

“This is one of those things that people say, ‘Of course, why didn’t we think of this before?’ The pandemic is acting as a coordinating device,” she says. “The fixed costs are big and we don’t want to have three or four sets of [lockers] out there.”"

Since the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic, Kitchener, Ont.-based education technology product maker InkSmith has made one “major transition” after another.

First, InkSmith, which makes 3-D printers, laser cutters, virtual reality headsets and robotic kits for educational uses, saw business decline as schools closed across Canada due to COVID-19. It also watched as the manufacturing plants in China that made its products shut down as the pandemic spread.

Then, being made aware of the need for made-in-Canada personal protective equipment, it started a new company, The Canadian Shield, making face shields and surgical masks. The 10-person company hired 300 employees in four months, became manufacturing experts, and leased a new 50,000-square-foot facility sight unseen.

“All you can do is laugh because it’s that insane,” says Jeremy Hedges, founder and president of InkSmith and The Canadian Shield.

Now, the company is taking this new manufacturing expertise and applying it to its original InkSmith business and bringing the manufacturing of its educational technology products back home instead of having them made overseas.

“With everything that’s happened with The Canadian Shield, we are going to onshore all that production [for InkSmith],” Mr. Hedges says.

InkSmith will assemble its 3-D printers and manufacture its robotics kits in Canada starting this fall.

“That’s a pretty major transition for us and it’s pretty exciting,” he says.

The rapid shifts at the company since March are “hard to believe,” adds chief technology officer Doug Braden. “It was surreal to say the least.”

The company saw the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) in Canada as a “crisis” and thought that it could help, Mr. Braden explains.

In late March, Dr. Neil Naik with the Kitchener-Waterloo Academy of Medicine came to InkSmith and told Mr. Hedges about the shortage of PPE that would face the region, Ontario and Canada over the next few weeks. He suggested the company use its laser cutters and 3-D printers to make face shields.

“We had a huge stock of machines that we could just unbox, toss on tables and start going,” says Mr. Hedges, and within hours they turned InkSmith’s 5,000 square foot office into a “micro factory” making face shields.

The plan was to donate as much as they could to local hospitals. But it took an hour to 3-D print the headband and only 30 seconds to cut the plastic shield with the laser cutter.

“It was the definition of not scalable,” Mr. Braden says. However, “we knew we could figure this problem out.”

Mr. Hedges and his staff worked on a fully laser cut design while calling on the community to 3-D print headbands, which resulted in 20,000 face shields being donated locally.

The company quickly received its Medical Device Establishment Licence, which made it a legal manufacturer of face shields and it immediately received an order for 350,000 face shields from Ontario. Knowing the company needed to ramp up production, it bought five clicker die-cutting machines that could punch out several plastic shields at once – and bought 12 more once they saw they worked.

“We went from making 100 shields a day to 10,000 shields a day within six days,” Mr. Hedges says. “It’s an old school technology… we just kind of repurposed it to meet this crazy need.”

Within about a month, The Canadian Shield had orders for at least 11.5 million face shields from hospitals, the Ontario and federal governments, Mr. Hedges says. “But it also meant we had to scale up enormously.” By then it was churning out 100,000 face shields per day.

So, the company leased a 50,000-square-foot facility, brought in more machines, including computer-controlled pneumatic die cutters and travelling head presses, started hiring staff and punching out more and more shields every day. “We had to modify [the designs] on the fly,” Mr. Braden says.

Open this photo in gallery Mr. Hedges says because of their background in tech and robotics, the team quickly tried more than a hundred prototypes to find the most effective way to make face shields. Glenn Lowson/The Globe and Mail

That boosted production to at least 200,000 shields a day. “That’s what we can pack and ship out the door,” Mr. Hedges says. Although, in one day, the company made 257,000 shields, “which is kind of nuts,” adds Mr. Braden, considering only weeks before it had made none.

With a background in tech and robotics, the team quickly tried more than a hundred prototypes to find the most effective way to make face shields, he says. It was also able to hire people with the right manufacturing, supply chain or engineering experience who were out of work due to the pandemic, Mr. Braden adds.

“In some ways, The Canadian Shield is the ultimate use case for how design thinking works in action,” Mr. Hedges says.

This experience means InkSmith now has the capability to manufacture its products in the country.

“We have this huge labour force and entity that we can now turn to manufacturing [InkSmith’s] original products here in Canada. Something I always dreamed of doing was bringing our production here to Waterloo and we’re going to do that this fall,” he says.

Everything is getting set up now and InkSmith, with the help of a local manufacturer that has excess time on its production line, will make printed circuit boards for its robotics kits and 3-D printers in Waterloo. As well, InkSmith is looking at purchasing its own circuit board production line – called an SMT or surface mount technology machine – from a local company.

“It can all be done here,” Mr. Hedges says.

By taking this new expertise and bringing InkSmith’s electronics manufacturing back to Canada “we’re hopefully turning a new page,” Mr. Hedge says. “That’s what we’re going to get out of this pandemic. I think we’re going to see this huge push at the government level to have products made in Canada.”

He says Canada is not that far behind in manufacturing and with automation – where machines make most items – it can be cost effective to make products here.

The pandemic highlighted “the fragility of international supply chains,” says Mr. Braden, and he’s seen some of startups fold because their production offshore shut down.

Bringing manufacturing back to Canada from China “is difficult but it’s not impossible,” says Dan Breznitz, the Munk Chair of Innovation Studies at the University of Toronto. “It is feasible, it should be done but it’s a systemic problem of the whole system.” It’s also a promising way to help boost job creation in Canada at a time where many are out of work.

The key is for a company to have people with the right skills to manufacture goods efficiently to keep costs contained, and have access to the right people to maintain the production lines and the suppliers to keep the company supplied with raw products, Mr. Breznitz says.

“I highly urge our governments at both the federal and provincial level to seize this opportunity and make it happen,” he says, because it takes an entire supply and manufacturing chain to make it successful.

“If COVID-19 taught us just one thing is that we have to rely on ourselves a little bit more … in times of crisis,” he says."

The COVID-19 pandemic hit at the worst time of year for Toronto-based agricultural technology startup Ukko Agro Inc.

Winter and early spring are when farmers make key decisions about what resources they need to plant, grow and harvest their crops in the coming months. It’s also an essential time for Ukko Agro to sell its digital tools that help farmers optimize pesticide, water and fertilizer usage to operate more sustainably.

“Agriculture is a high touch-point industry. A lot of farmers expect you to come to their fields, spend some time, explain what you do and then sign up,” says Ketan Kaushish, co-founder and chief executive officer of Ukko Agro, which has clients across North America and parts of Europe, specifically Belgium and Sweden.

With international travel complicated by the coronavirus and many farmers unwilling to take in-person meetings amid the pandemic, Ukko Agro – alongside many businesses – has been forced to shift its sales strategy online.

While online selling often isn’t the same as being there in person, businesses like Ukko Agro benefit from providing software that can be easily exported to new and existing customers around the world.

“The advantage is you don’t have to deal with export issues of physical product delays at borders, or stopped shipments,” says Stuart Browne, an instructor in the MBA and Master of Finance programs at York University’s Schulich School of Business.

Although many companies are spending less due to the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic, Mr. Browne says there are more opportunities for Canadian software businesses at home and abroad given the global shift toward doing business online.

“They don’t have any borders, which means anyone can access them for the most part,” says Mr. Browne, who is also CEO of Pycap Venture Partners, a Toronto-based venture capital and corporate finance firm. “What good entrepreneurs should be doing is going into the market and finding problems and creating solutions,” both now during the pandemic and in general economic times.

Toronto-based Act Analytics Corp., which offers an environmental, social and governance (ESG) portfolio analytics platform for registered investment advisers in North America, the United Kingdom and Australia, has seen its sales strategy interrupted by the inability to pitch its product in person at conferences and other events.

However, the company is taking advantage of more businesses operating online during the pandemic, as well as the growing interest in sustainable investing.

“People have used the recent market volatility as an acid test for ESG investing – and sustainability has never been more discussed in light of COVID and the Black Lives Matter movement,” says Act Analytics co-founder and managing partner Mike Unwin. “On the marketing and sales side of things, a new virtual world and a new focus on IT infrastructure have played into the hands of many SaaS [software as a service] and e-commerce companies like ours.”

Not having to cross borders with a physical product “is a huge advantage for us being exporters of cloud-based software,” Mr. Unwin says. “There’s no limit to the places we’re getting interest from. It’s truly global.” He says the interest is coming from places such as the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Switzerland, France, Hong Kong and mainland China.

Mr. Unwin has also noticed increased interest from existing and potential clients around the online customer experience, including the ease of use of the company’s analytics tools. Act Analytics is working on expanding its digital presence, including marketing, distribution networks and partnership opportunities.

“We’ve seen a lot of people coming into our environment, purchasing and trying the product,” he says. “People are having to rely more on their technology …. I think, generally, people are more comfortable interacting and doing commerce over the internet, which is favourable to us.”

Still, Mr. Unwin is looking forward to the day when his team can meet clients in person again as part of their operations.

“We’d like to meet the people we do business with,” he says. “Once the world opens up again we can do more of that … I think there’s little substitute for meeting someone in person and generating a genuine relationship. I think that’s still something that people crave. It helps them become comfortable with a new business partner.”

When the pandemic is over and business returns to relative normal, Ukko Agro’s Mr. Kaushish expects to find a balance between selling his software in-person and online.

“We have to figure out [the right mix] between using digital tools and meeting farmers in-person,” he says. “It might take some time for farmers to use digital tools to get acquainted with and purchase new products, but it will eventually happen.”

In the meantime, Ukko Agro is hoping to capitalize on the growing interest companies have in using online products to run their business. The company is building up its online sales tools and both improving and expanding its products to help reach new international markets.

“[The pandemic environment] has shown us that we don’t need to be on the ground to enter new markets,” Mr. Kaushish says, adding that his company is having discussions with companies in Brazil and Argentina. It also has its sights on potential customers in other parts of Europe.

“The mindset is changing [around using technology], and hopefully we see the positive effect in the long term,” he adds. “If everything goes online, nothing stops us from working in South America and [elsewhere in] Europe … I believe companies that build simple and reliable technology-based products will be the ones that win in this new world.”"

Medical waivers. Masks. Virtual showings. Seven-figure purchases, sight unseen.

Home buying and selling has seen a head-snapping shift during the COVID-19 era, as both parties deal with the demands of physical distancing, virtual showings and previously unheard-of safety considerations.

One thing that hasn’t changed is the competition: Most major Canadian markets are as buoyant as ever after a brief slump and in defiance of gloomy forecasts about the impact the pandemic could have on real estate activity.

But the nuts and bolts of the process – how buyers and sellers interact and how realtors work with both – looks dramatically different than it did a few months ago, forcing years’ worth of sales innovation into just a few months.

Here are a few of the biggest changes:

Say goodbye to open houses

So much for perusing open houses as a weekend pastime. Physical distancing brought group showings to an abrupt halt this spring. As restrictions eased nationwide, open houses slowly started up again. In Ontario, for example, the province lifted its prohibition in most areas on July 17 as part of its Stage 3 reopening.

Still, open houses are nowhere near as common as they once were. Sellers remain wary of inviting large groups of people to traipse through their homes and some renters’ groups have spoken out against them as well.

“Before you could have upwards of two or three different agents with groups, at any given time, showing the same property,” says Darren Josephs, a Toronto Re/Max agent. “Now, the windows are 15-to-30 minutes and no overlap.”

Also, each client goes through individually, following sanitizing protocols before and after each visit. And there’s no such thing as dropping in with a moment’s notice, Mr. Josephs says.

“I think a lot of people were never entirely comfortable with open houses, especially sellers,” he says. “I think we’ll see a real long-term effect from this and more qualified showings, which tend to weed out people who aren’t serious.”

Vancouver-based independent realtor Chris Strand says there’s a “split in the realtor community” on the issue. He points out that realtors can often pick up new clients at open houses. However, he agrees that a decline in open houses – at least as we once knew them – may be one of the biggest long-term changes to emerge from the pandemic.

Better digital sales tools

The era of out-of-focus photos and sparse online listings is over, according to Patti Ross, a Royal LePage realtor in Halifax.

“You’ve always seen listings and asked, ‘Why are the photos so bad?’” she says. “We were proactive in my brokerage years ago in stepping up online marketing and building a photography and video department and it’s really paying off now.”

Open this photo in gallery Mr. Strand says a rise in virtual house touring may be due to the current bull market in housing. DARRYL DYCK/The Globe and Mail

Realtors have also long been limited in the number of photographs they can use on listings but, from coast-to-coast, those limits have been bumped up, allowing potential buyers to get a better sense of a property before arranging a viewing.

“Our real estate board just upped our photo count from 20 to 40,” Mr. Strand says, “and we’re seeing more people hiring professional videographers and using virtual walk-through tools.”

Sometimes that means 360-degree photos tours and, for high-end properties, it can mean full-blown immersive 3D renders of a property’s interior. That can help drive more selective, qualified showings, and fewer potential buyers arranging a viewing out of curiosity, only to show up and quickly realize the property isn’t right for them.

More safety protocols

When in-person viewings do take place, safety has become a top priority. In most cases, realtors will go into homes in advance, opening every door, cabinet and cupboard for clients.

“We ask that visitors treat the house like a museum,” Mr. Josephs says. “No touching.”

Potential buyers sign waivers attesting to their lack of COVID-19 symptoms and international travel. And everyone – buyers, sellers and agents – wear masks and keep the mandated two-metre distance.

Even Ms. Ross’ photographers and videographers make sure their gear is sanitized before it enters a property and they clean it thoroughly once they leave.

Some realtors hope that better safety protocols can instill more confidence in sellers to list their homes.

Major markets nationwide are currently grappling with a serious imbalance between supply and demand, as buyers return to the market in droves, but sellers remain shy. ""

You definitely see people waiting or holding off on listing,” Ms. Ross says. “But once you talk to people and tell them about process, they feel better.”

More risk-taking

That imbalance between buyers and sellers has also made markets more competitive. In Halifax, Ms. Ross recently sold one suburban property listed at $229,000 for $55,000 over asking, after entertaining more than 30 offers. In Vancouver, Mr. Strand is seeing similar activity, as is Mr. Josephs in Toronto, where he recently sold one home for $350,000 over asking, after 26 offers.

More buyers are also signing off on purchases remotely. In June, Nanos Research conducted a poll for the Ontario Real Estate Association that revealed 42 per cent of buyers were open to buying a home even if they could only see it online beforehand.

Ms. Ross says she’s noticed more buyers willing to purchase places sight unseen. (Atlantic Canada’s current self-isolation restrictions for out-of-region travellers mean visiting the region to house-hunt is especially impractical).

“We’re doing virtual tours that allow people to shop from Ontario or Vancouver,” she says, “and walk through the house remotely.”

She’s also begun doing walk-through video tours of neighbourhoods. A video tour showcasing sports facilities and outdoor trails near one property recently helped seal the deal with one out-of-province family.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Strand is seeing the same kind of activity in Vancouver.

“We’re using FaceTime, and I’ve had potential buyers from Ontario, Alberta, and several from Hong Kong,” he says.

Mr. Strand says some of that activity may be due to the current bull market in housing. But most industry watchers, including major banks and the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation, are still forecasting at least a modest decline in home prices over the coming year. As sellers re-enter the market, spiralling prices may well simmer down – good news for buyers already struggling with deteriorating affordability.

But even if markets re-balance, there seems little doubt that COVID-19 will result in lasting changes to the way Canadians buy and sell homes.

“Anything could happen in the next few months,” Mr. Strand says. “We’re all just waiting to see what sticks as we keep going through this and what goes back to the way it was before.”"

The action

Open this photo in gallery The kitchen has been updated. Michael St. Jean Realty Inc.

With pandemic restrictions in full force in late March and in-person visits limited, listing agent Michael St. Jean opted to expand his online photo gallery for this 1½-storey house.

“We typically get a lot of photos, but once the pandemic hit, we started taking photos of the furnace, electrical panels and even the basement walls and things of that nature for people to get a look at the mechanical elements,” Mr. St. Jean said.

“And not just for the buyers, but for appraisers who were not willing to go inside.”

After two weeks on the market, the asking price was cut by $10,000. That move paid off and negotiations with a potential buyer began in late April. “We’re pretty aggressive with reductions if we don’t find we’re getting the [desired] level of activity in the first 12 to 14 days, especially in that price bracket,” Mr. St. Jean said.

“It’s not easy to find homes any more in the $300,000s, so we felt comfortable no matter what the situation. We knew the demand was strong in this category of housing and price point.”

What they got

Open this photo in gallery There is new laminate flooring in the living and dining room. Michael St. Jean Realty Inc.

This mid-century home on a 43-foot-by-135-foot lot has 952 square feet of living space, with an updated kitchen and bathroom, as well as a new laminate flooring in the living and dining room.

By the stairs leading up to two out of three bedrooms is an exit to the private backyard and two-car parking.

The agent’s take

“These are older homes on big lots in a nice east-end neighbourhood close to the highways, golf courses and amenities,” Mr. St. Jean said.

“There were some updates done – it’s not your total fixer upper – so a buyer could come in and build on the things that have been done.”

If we didn’t see this one coming, we should have. FCA has been finding new roles for its supercharged 700-plus-horsepower Hellcat V8 ever since the engine first torched tarmac in the 2015 Challenger and Charger. The 6.2-litre monster motor now also performs in the Trackhawk version of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, will soon play a part in the Dodge Durango and has “guest starred” in aftermarket conversions of the Jeep Gladiator.

But the Hellcat-motored 2021 Ram 1500 TRX is more than just the world’s fastest pickup truck. (Or so FCA claims.) It also aims to rewrite the rule book on truck off-road ability. Going even further, it also represents a new pinnacle trim grade for Ram, offering luxury (e.g. suede and carbon-fibre trim) and technology (e.g. head-up display) not available on even Ram’s previously-ultimate Limited grade.

The mission, said interior design chief Ryan Nagode, was to create a top-dog halo product previously lacking in the Ram line.

The current unchallenged halo-wearer among high-performance off-road pickups is the Ford F-150 Raptor. And “TRX” reads an awful lot like “T-Rex.” See where Ram is going with this? Dinosaur wars!

Canadian pricing has yet to be revealed, but when it goes on sale late this year, U.S. pricing starts at US$69,995 (C$93,000). And yes, that is just a starting point. Ram will provide options to help you spend more. Or try to bag yourself one of the 702 Launch Edition models (100 of them for Canada) that start at $88,570 stateside.

For reference, the Ford Raptor SuperCrew starts at $79,199 and its twin-turbo 3.5-litre V6 is rated at 450 hp; the closest equivalent from GM, a GMC Sierra AT4 with the off-road performance package and 6.2-litre, 420-hp V8, would start at around $70,000.

Available only in a Crew Cab/Short Box configuration, the Ram’s new “apex predator” is founded on a beefed-up frame that is claimed to be 75 per cent new. New aluminum front control arms and upgraded rear axle help widen the track by 6 inches, and TRX-exclusive 35-inch Goodyear Territory tires are sheltered by flared fenders that broaden the body by 8 inches. A 51-mm suspension lift provides 300 mm of ground clearance.

Off-road oriented features and tech include Bilstein Black Hawk e2 active dampers, Active Terrain Dynamics, 8 drive modes (including “Baja” for desert racing), 13-inches of front and 14-inches of rear wheel travel, a tow-hook at each corner, electronic locking rear differential, and a high-mounted alternator to facilitate the 32-inch-deep wading target. The transfer case includes a full-time AWD mode and a 2.64:1 Low Range.

Combine all that with the 6.2-litre supercharged V8′s 702 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque and you have a monster truck that can accelerate from 0-60 mph (96 km/h) in 4.5 seconds, 0 to 100 mph (160 km/h) in 10.5 seconds, and then, at the end of the drag strip, continue across the farmer’s field next door without slowing down.

In case you’re wondering, the engine is 5 hp down on its passenger-car version, mainly due to the pickup’s different exhaust plumbing. Top speed is electronically limited by the tire construction to “only” 190 km/h.

Moving back inside, the 12-inch touch-screen includes an update of Performance Pages that includes Off-Road Pages. A traditional T-handle shift lever replaces the rotary knob on other Rams and is supplemented by aluminum shift paddles. Launch Control is standard.

An available digital rear-view mirror is a first for FCA (as is the head-up display) while other visual aids include a forward camera that shows the tire lines for the steering angle, and twiddle-a-knob trailer reverse steering control that doesn’t need a prior set-up process. Speaking of trailers, the max tow rating is 8,100 lbs. Max payload is 1,310 lbs.

What’s your ideal two-car garage? Ask any gearhead, and you’re going to get a host of answers: a blistering-fast Ferrari F40 and a go-anywhere Unimog; a dashing Aston Martin and a genteel Rolls-Royce; a classic Alfa Romeo and a tow truck for when it gets temperamental. Well, here’s a garage full of fun for you, and only one is actually a car.

Initially, this pairing was conceived of as an oddball comparison. However, a mountain bike can get to places no car can, while a car can ferry around kids and groceries or hit the highway much more easily than a bicycle can.

When you electrify both, things really get interesting. Even during the pandemic, interest in electric vehicles has been increasing rapidly, such that the stock of new electric cars is low. The same is true of electric-assist bicycles, which are having a banner sales year.

After a $5,000 federal rebate for electric cars plus a $3,000 provincial rebate in British Columbia, the total price tag of $52,592 is about the same as for one conventional, mid-range enthusiast vehicle such as a Toyota 4Runner or a Ford Mustang GT, to choose two widely varying examples.

Next to sleeker, more expensive models from Tesla, the Bolt’s stubby profile looks more like a generic electric vehicle. However, it’s hiding its light under a bushel. GM’s all-electric runabout provides accessible electric performance and is a genuine hoot to drive.

With 200 horsepower available from its AC drive unit and a nearly instantaneous 266 lb.-ft. of torque, the Bolt only takes a half-second longer to reach highway speeds than a previous-generation Volkswagen GTI. Get the Bolt going so its low-rolling-resistance Michelin tires don’t squeal and then punch the accelerator, and it’s just as quick as the GTI. The Chevrolet weighs 160 kilograms more than the VW, but the battery mass is mounted low on the chassis, and with a short wheelbase, the Bolt has handling to match its name.

Together, it adds up to a car that provides what that original Volkswagen GTI did 30-odd years ago: a flexible family hatchback that’s really good fun to drive. On the short and curving highway on-ramp near my house, where modestly powered crossovers can make merging tricky, the little Bolt scooted forward eagerly. Both of my kids in the rear literally shouted, “Whee!”

Something that’s often missed in discussions of electric vehicles is how enjoyable they are to drive. Yes, Tesla makes the headlines as the Model S battles the Porsche Taycan over super-electric-sedan supremacy, but down where price tags are more reasonable, there’s still a great deal of fun to be had.

Further, with 417 km of range from its 66 kWh battery, a roomy cabin and 479 litres of cargo space with the rear seats up, there’s nothing to prevent the Bolt from being the sole vehicle for a family of four. Yes, cold weather and quick driving can sap range, but even with half its range depleted, the Bolt will still have plenty of juice for daily use. Add in a clever left-hand steering-wheel paddle that uses regenerative braking to slow the car, and the entire Bolt driving experience is low stress.

Perhaps the only drawback is the car’s interior which, while spacious and practically laid out, doesn’t look like that of a $50,000-plus vehicle. You’re paying for the batteries and the technology here, so expect the Bolt to be not much nicer than your average GM mid-sized sedan. The rear cargo cover is particularly flimsy.

However, all the expected technology is on offer, displayed on a bright, clear, and not oversized screen. Driver assists such as cross-traffic alerts and automatic headlights are available on the Premier model.

Now, for the e-bike. Hold on to your seat: If the Bolt is a fun little scooter for racing about town, then the Sight VLT is a single-minded bike for racing up and down mountains.

The Sight VLT adds Shimano’s STEPS E8000 pedal-assist unit to Norco’s All Mountain range. The company also offers more reasonable options in trail or cross-country bikes, starting at slightly less than half the price. The C1 29 is a top-level model with a 630 watt-hour in-tube battery pack and roughly 50 kilometres of range.

For this kind of money, you could buy a used Mazda Miata, which, until now, I would have said was the best bang for your buck on wheels. However, riding the VLT, as it absolutely ironed-out hills in its loose-surface Trail mode and then sprinted toward a packed-dirt berm, I’ve had to change my mind. You can make a Miata jump, I suppose, but only the once.

The VLT comes with a weight penalty over a normal mountain bike because of the battery and experienced downhill riders report that it’s not quite as playful as the manual-bike experience. Further, electric-assist bikes are not without their detractors in the mountain-bike crowd, some of whom point out that inexperienced riders can get into big trouble on a heavy, fast bike.

Yet if a sports car on a lonely road offers an intoxicating kind of freedom, then the VLT offers, perhaps, an even more exhilarating kind. You really feel as if you could just ride this thing straight up the side of one of the rugged North Shore mountains. It opens up a whole playground of trails.

Two rides, then: One for treading lightly on the grocery run yet still enjoying yourself behind the wheel; the other for tripling your downhill time on the weekends and seeking out new trails.

There is, of course, no one answer to the perfect two-car garage. This pair, however, is hard to beat.

If your car is hit by an uninsured driver in provinces with public insurance, rest assured – you’re covered, as long as you have insurance.

In British Columbia, for instance, it works the same as in the provinces with private insurance.

If you're in a crash where an uninsured driver is at fault, your collision insurance, if you bought it, will cover the damages to your car, says the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC).

“The majority of B.C. drivers purchase ICBC’s collision coverage and will get the full benefit of that coverage if their vehicle is damaged by an uninsured or unidentified (hit-and-run) driver,” said Lindsay Wilkins, ICBC spokeswoman, in an e-mail. “The claim would be handled under the collision coverage, and ICBC would waive the deductible.”

But in B.C., there’s recourse if you don’t have collision insurance. “For damage to property other than vehicles, or to vehicles without collision coverage, the statutory fund is available when there is no other coverage available,” Wilkins says.

In B.C., anyone with basic insurance or a valid B.C. driver’s licence has uninsured-motorist protection, Wilkins says.

Unlike uninsured protection in provinces with public insurance, which only covers injuries or has a cap on coverage for vehicle damages, B.C.'s fund covers both injuries and collision damage, Wilkins says.

""For damage to property other than vehicles, or to vehicles without collision coverage, the statutory fund is available when there is no other coverage available,"" Wilkins says.

The fund covers up to $1-million for injuries and property damage if you’re in a hit and run or if you’re hit by somebody who doesn’t have insurance.

That’s different than Ontario, where you’re only covered for up to $25,000 of the damage to your car if you’re hit by an uninsured driver and you don’t have collision. It’s also different than Alberta, Quebec and the Atlantic provinces, where damage to your car wouldn’t be covered at all if you’re hit by an uninsured driver and don’t have collision insurance.

Even in B.C., the fund won't protect you if you're at fault. If you caused a crash, whether the other driver had insurance or not, your car repairs will only be covered if you have collision protection.

Do you need to sue the other driver first to access the fund?

""For most claims for injury, death or damage to property (including vehicle damage), under the statutory coverage, ICBC will settle directly with the claimant and seek recovery from the uninsured motorist,"" Wilkins said.

Saskatchewan and Manitoba

What about the other two provinces with public insurance?

In Saskatchewan and Manitoba, if you have basic insurance, then you and your car are covered in any collision, whether the other driver is insured or not.

Story continues below advertisement

“In Saskatchewan, a valid registration means you have basic plate insurance on your plates which includes coverage for damage to your vehicle (subject to a deductible), personal-injury insurance from a vehicle collision and liability insurance for damage your vehicle causes to another vehicle or property, or injury to others,” said Tyler McMurchy, spokesman for Saskatchewan Government Insurance (SGI), in an e-mail.

Unlike in other provinces, Saskatchewan and Manitoba drivers don't need to purchase additional collision coverage – damage is covered even if they're at fault.

For instance, in a collision where both drivers have insurance, the at-fault driver would just have to pay the deductible on his vehicle. That deductible is $700 in Saskatchewan and $500 in Manitoba.

If you don't have insurance at all, then your vehicle damage won't be covered.

“If you were breaking the law by driving an uninsured vehicle ... and you were struck by another uninsured vehicle or you were a victim of a hit and run, your vehicle would have no insurance coverage and you’d have to pay for any repairs to your vehicle out of pocket,” McMurchy says. “As a Saskatchewan resident, you’d still have no-fault injury coverage if you were hurt, however.”

In both provinces, if you’re at fault and don’t have insurance, the insurance company could sue you for the cost of the damages to the other vehicle.

The California Independent System Operator (California ISO), which manages the power grid, declared an emergency Friday evening and directed utilities around the state to shed their power loads.

The state’s three biggest utilities — Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric — turned off power to more than 410,000 homes and businesses for about an hour at a time until the emergency declaration ended 3 1/2 hours later.

The move came as temperatures around the state hit triple digits in many areas, and air conditioning use soared.

The power grid is mostly stressed during the late afternoon and early evening due to higher demand and solar energy production falling. The state tried to prepare for the expected rise in electricity use by urging conservation and trying to buy more power but a high-pressure system building over Western states meant there was less available.

The state remained gripped by the heat wave Saturday and the power grid operator will decide whether to continue the rolling outages on a day-to-day basis, said California ISO spokeswoman Anne Gonzales.

“We’re dealing with weather, clouds, wildfires … these are quickly evolving situations, quickly changing,” Gonzales said.

The last time the state ordered rolling outages was during an energy crisis in 2001. Blackouts occurred several times from January to May, including one that affected more than 1.5 million customers. The cause was a combination of energy shortages and market manipulation by energy wholesalers, infamously including Enron Corp., that drove up prices by withholding supplies.

Counties up and down the state reported scattered outages, although the city of Los Angeles, which has its own power generating system, wasn’t affected.

The heat wave brought dangerously high temperatures, increased wildfire danger and fears of coronavirus spread as people flock to beaches and parks for relief.

Temperatures were expected to peak above 110 degrees (43 Celsius) in inland regions of state Saturday. The sweltering weather was expected to continue into Wednesday across greater Los Angeles, the Central Valley, Sierra Nevada foothills and parts of the San Francisco Bay Area.

Santa Clara, Alameda and Contra Costa counties opened cooling centres that will welcome people this weekend from the afternoon to the early evening. San Francisco officials said the city is recommending people stay home and that if the heat indoors gets intolerable to go outside to a shady place where they can stay cool and distant from other people.

“Congregate indoor sites are not safe necessarily during COVID-19. It is better to follow other instructions during this heat wave,” said Mary Ellen Carroll, executive director of the Department of Emergency Management.

Carroll encouraged residents to check on family, friends and neighbours, especially older adults and those in frail health, and reminded people to always wear a face mask when in the vicinity of people who don’t share their household.

“We know it’s going to be beautiful out this weekend but we just want everyone to remember that we are in a very serious response to this COVID-19 virus,” Carroll said.

Several cities opened cooling centres, but with limited capacity because of social distancing requirements.

The scorching temperatures are a concern for firefighters battling blazes that have destroyed several homes and erupted near rural and urban foothill neighbourhoods, driving through tinder-dry brush.

In addition to the possibility of heat stroke and other hot-weather illnesses, health officers were concerned that people will pack beaches, lakes and other recreation areas without following mask and social distancing orders — a major concern in the state that has seen more than 613,000 coronavirus cases.

Israel saw a COVID-19 resurgence after a May heat wave inspired school officials to let children remove their masks, Dr. George Rutherford, an epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, told the San Francisco Chronicle.

When asked about some international investors starting to shun the oil sands, Mr. Kenney declared it was a passing fad, the “flavour of the day.”

It’s been a long day.

The oil sands have become a global climate-change lightning rod, the bitumen of northeastern Alberta called the “tar sands” and branded the dirtiest oil anywhere. The image is unfair, but it has become a reality that Alberta and Canada must address.

Story continues below advertisement

It seemed less pressing in years past, when it was only a few Hollywood stars helicoptering aghast over oil sands mines. Opposition has since expanded, and today the list of those who feel it financially prudent to take up the mantle of oil sands skeptic includes some of the world’s biggest money managers, banks, insurers and, yes, even oil companies.

The shift began several years ago. In 2017, Royal Dutch Shell, a long-time oil sands investor, sold most of its holdings. HSBC in 2018 backed away from financing oil sands projects. Earlier this year, BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, said it would exclude oil sands firms from several funds, calling it and coal “the worst offenders … from a climate perspective.” And in May, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund cut holdings of Canada’s oil sands producers, deeming their greenhouse gas emissions “unacceptable.”

In the past several weeks, Zurich Insurance Group pulled out as lead insurer of the Trans Mountain pipeline, Deutsche Bank said it would not fund new oil sands projects; and Total, the French oil company with two large oil sands holdings, put out a news release titled “climate ambition” and said it would produce less from the oil sands than previously planned.

Mr. Kenney’s instinct has been to fight back by lashing out. He accused HSBC of “hypocrisy.” He established a countermarketing “war room,” but it has been a flop, persuading no one. Its response to the Norwegians involved putting out a series of “facts” and calling the divestment “misinformed at best.” In late July, Alberta’s Energy Minister lambasted Total’s move as “poorly informed and short-sighted.”

It’s true Alberta and Canada have robust regulatory systems, are taking real action on climate change, and that Indigenous people are active in the business of the oil sands. Conservatives love to say that, compared with countries such as Angola or Saudi Arabia, Alberta oil is “ethical oil.” All true. Yet international opinion is, nonetheless, moving against the oil sands. Countering that narrative will be difficult.

It is also true the moves against the oil sands are largely symbolic corporate marketing campaigns, in response to pressure from activists. Deutsche Bank still does business with oil companies. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund is financed by oil revenues. Oil companies, including those in the oil sands, are in the portfolios of many BlackRock funds. Total’s oil sands stake is still producing more than 100,000 barrels a day of Canadian bitumen.

Using the oil sands to check a climate-action box is an easy, cost-free PR win for some corporations and politicians. It’s why Barack Obama vetoed the Keystone XL pipeline in 2015. That did nothing to temper America’s voracious appetite for oil, or its (at the time) booming fracking industry, but it got environmentalists off his back.

Story continues below advertisement

For Canada and Alberta to change the narrative, words will not be enough. Zesty rejoinders will fall flat. In the writing business, there is a saying: Show, don’t tell. Alberta spends a lot of time telling.

More show, please. Action is essential. The oil sands are getting cleaner – emissions per barrel are falling – but, to secure the future, they have to get cleaner, faster. To shake the “stigma,” the head of Canadian Natural Resources recently said, meeting emissions reduction targets is crucial.

Mr. Kenney’s first act in office was to eliminate the consumer carbon tax in Alberta. He then watered down Alberta’s industrial carbon tax and fought Ottawa for weaker rules on methane. Canada, meanwhile, may have a nationwide carbon tax, but its 2022 level of $50 a tonne is not especially high. It is not a signal of major ambition.

Two-thirds of Canada’s oil production comes from the oil sands. Alberta and Canada need to show the world this country is serious about reducing oil sands emissions, if we want to keep selling bitumen. Show, don’t tell.

Toyota’s much-anticipated plug-in hybrid version of its popular RAV4 compact SUV goes on sale today in Canada – but only in Quebec for now.

Quebec offers a generous subsidy for buying electric vehicles, and the 302 horsepower RAV4 Prime PHEV qualifies there for an additional provincial rebate of $8,000 on top of the national rebate of $5,000 available to all Canadians. This means Quebecers will see $13,000 removed from its list price.

The most basic RAV4 Prime, the SE edition, has an MSRP of $44,990. The better-equipped XSE edition lists for $51,590, and the top-of-the-line technology package lists for $56,990. These prices are before all rebates.

British Columbia also has a rebate program for electric vehicles that will provide an extra subsidy of $1,500. Toyota expects to begin selling the RAV4 Prime in B.C. before the end of the year, but only in small quantities to start and probably less than a thousand Canadian vehicles in total during 2020. No other provinces offer rebates on EVs, though the vehicle will begin to be sold in the rest of Canada by next summer.

The RAV4 Prime is not a totally electric vehicle, and it has a gasoline engine for much of its driving that can cover more than 900 km between fill-ups. However, its larger 18.1 kWh battery, which gives a totally-electric range of 60 kilometres, and its starting price below $45,000, help qualify it for the full discount available to EVs both federally and in Quebec. It qualifies for the full discount available to PHEVs in B.C.

In fact, in Quebec, the RAV4 Prime will be slightly less expensive than the equivalent RAV4 Hybrid, while offering more features and an extra 83 horsepower.

Toyota says it does not plan sales strategy around government incentives. “(They) are typically short-term in nature, they normally last less than a full product cycle, and they tend to come and go without warning,” says Stephen Beatty, Toyota Canada’s Vice-President for Corporate Affairs.

“Program criteria like price caps, or technology requirements, regularly change, so you need to make the assumption that if you’ve done the competitive product planning correctly, a whole segment of the market is going to move at the same time, keeping things in relative balance. But while that’s the only assumption you can make, it sometimes doesn’t hold true, particularly where regional incentives vary within a single national market.”

Ontario offered the most generous EV rebates in North America until 2018, when they were cancelled by the newly-elected Conservative government.

Quebec also has a punitive policy of fining automakers that do not sell enough zero-emission vehicles. It’s a complicated formula of credits, but basically, Quebec’s Bill 104 demands that a rising percentage of an automaker’s total sales in the province must be zero-emission, or electric, vehicles. For every vehicle sold below that percentage, there is a fine of $5,000. In 2020, the percentage is 9.5. Last year, it was 6.5 per cent, and next year it will be 12 per cent, rising to 22 per cent in 2025. British Columbia is considering implementing a similar policy.

Story continues below advertisement

(If an auto maker sells more than the required percentage – for example, Tesla, which sells 100 per cent of its vehicles as EVs – then it obtains credits that can be sold to other automakers. There are similar laws in California and 10 other states, and Tesla has earned more than US$2 billion so far by selling its credits to competitors, notably FCA and General Motors.)

Toyota’s Prius Prime is the maker’s only other plug-in hybrid, and it was also first sold in Quebec in order to avoid punitive provincial fines. Toyota says every model in its lineup will have an electrified version by 2025, and it expects 40 per cent of its Canadian sales to be electrified by then. This year, it expects 20 per cent of its sales to be electrified, but this includes conventional hybrids that still create tailpipe emissions and so do not offset Quebec’s demand for zero-emission vehicles.

The RAV4 is Toyota’s best-selling vehicle in North America, and it is the best-selling passenger vehicle in both Canada and the U.S. that is not a pickup truck. The basic RAV4 starts at $28,090 and the RAV4 Hybrid starts at $32,350.

RAV4s for North America are built in Canada at Toyota’s plants in Cambridge, Ontario, though production was ceased for almost a month in the spring due to precautions against the COVID-19 virus. Toyota says it is struggling to meet demand, building additional vehicles at its Kentucky plant and importing others from Japan. The RAV4 Prime is built in Japan, where it’s already on sale.

“The reality is, the world is changing very rapidly. The types of products that are in demand are changing quite dramatically,” says Beatty.

“As you can imagine, with governments intervening in markets all around the world, planning correctly for that is a very difficult task. We are committed to making sure that electrification spreads across our lineup, and that it happens very quickly. The Prius Prime has been an enormous success story here in Canada and we hope to follow that same path with the RAV4 Prime.”

I’ve taken them apart and cleaned them, and they’re fine, but after a week or so the squeal comes back.

Derek

I’ve never kept official records, but I’m pretty sure noisy, squealing brakes is the No. 1 car complaint I get the privilege of dealing with on a daily basis. However, when I think back to the days that I was a young technician at a Honda dealer, I don’t seem to remember the problem being as prevalent. I’m dating myself now, but I remember early 90s Accords travelling 200,000 kilometers on a single set of brake rotors, only having to resurface them at each brake-pad-replacement interval.

How times have changed. The brake lathes at our shop – one stationary, one on-car-only – get used sporadically, whereas they used to be functioning all day long.

Manufacturers repeatedly state that brake parts and wheel bearings are exactly the same quality as I fondly remember, but I don’t buy it – everything is cheaper now.

Derek, your issue is going to be one of these issues: corrosion buildup on a poor-quality brake component, the use of improper brake lubricants, or one of the anti-squeal brake-pad shims is missing or not sitting in its proper place. Chances are, Derek, if your DIY skill level is sufficient, you are dealing with this latter issue.

Almost weekly, a vehicle shows up to my shop after receiving the $99 brake-job special from one of the numerous dark and dingy garages that populate most major cities’ back streets. The car owner is frustrated because they weren’t told their $99 investment came with these horrible noises emanating from their brakes. After we inspect and verify proper installation, we usually try to send the owner back to the original shop for some sort of warranty. Sadly, the vehicles usually re-appear a short time later with an even more frustrated owner, who now asks us to throw out the parts and start over again with better quality pieces.

Hi Lou!

Here’s an interesting one for you. I drive a 2012 Mazdaspeed 3 with 84,000 kilometres on it. My summer tires are 225/40-18s on factory rims. The car drives superbly on these tires and wheels. However, when I switch to my winter tires, which are 215/50-17s on aftermarket rims, I get a pull to the left on acceleration. When I lift, the pull disappears. Otherwise, the car tracks straight, there is no vibration or wheel-wobbling to indicate a bent rim or belt problem. Also, the car brakes straight and true.

But here’s the weird part. If I swap the front pair for the rears, the problem completely disappears. No pull, no nothing, just like on the summer tires. What do you think? All I can think of is that one of the tires is very slightly of a different diameter, and that the differential (it is limited-slip) is partly locking under power due to the different rotational speeds. It is a mystery to me.

Thanks!

Dave M., Tara, Ont.

That is an odd one Dave. Most higher-horsepower front-wheel-drive vehicles do have noticeable torque steer when winter tires are installed.

That being said, your limited-slip differential should not be engaging on acceleration, unless wheel slip is occurring. Therefore, your issue has to be tire related. The fact that your summer tires drive true and straight and your winters, in one orientation, also drive fine, indicates that one tire is not right. Could it be a tire diameter problem? Sure, but you should be able to measure your tire depth and verify and compare your results.

Any tire retailer will attest that sometimes tires can look perfectly fine but cause the oddest of drivability problems. Don’t overthink it Dave; I’m sure when the time comes to replace the winter tires, the new set will drive perfectly.

What’s on my radar

A recent study from research firm IHS Markit suggests that the average age of cars and trucks in the U.S. is on the rise at 11.9 years, while Canadian stats from 2016 indicate 9.6 years. However, I’m sure the Canadian numbers are also on the rise given the ongoing pandemic – people are being more cautious with their money. Accordingly, I have noticed a defined shift in the discussions that I have with my customers, from “what new car should I buy?” to “what used car should I buy?” Whether this is going to be a long-term shift or just a temporary blip is unknown to me, but since many are asking, here are my thoughts.

Story continues below advertisement

Be realistic with your budget. Too many buyers try to reach for the newest car possible by buying a higher-mileage vehicle. I have found that most who purchase a high-mileage vehicle typically spend the amount they saved on unexpected repairs within the first couple of years of second-hand ownership. Looking for something well-maintained, but a couple of years older with average mileage, is almost always better. Know what average mileage is for your locale. For example, if you are located in the Greater Toronto Area, the average vehicle will see approximately 20,000 km per year. When a vehicle you are looking at has significantly lower kilometres per year than that, it had better come with a full service history so you can verify. No service history and low annual kilometres? I’d be cautious. Know who you are buying from. When you go to purchase a private vehicle, it should have a license plate on it that corresponds to the vehicle registration. If the car in question is only a few years old and has inaccurate – or no – plates on it, chances are you are dealing with someone flipping cars for profit, also known as curbsiders. Run away from these people. Don’t always trust the accident-free paperwork. Many cars have unreported accidents that were paid for in cash by the previous owner. It takes a trained eye to spot some of the not-so-obvious paint and accident-repair work. I regularly perform pre-purchase inspections on vehicles sourced from big local dealers that have undiscovered accident repairs. A pre-purchase inspection or second opinion by a qualified professional is never a bad idea.

The Mercedes-Benz GLS has long been my favourite specimen of my least-favourite species. As a green-leaning gearhead, I prefer my cars small, agile and efficient (my daily-driver dream car would be a Volkswagen e-Golf with GTI suspension). But if ever someone gifted me a full-size luxury SUV, I’d have hoped for a GLS.

Offering all the status of a Mercedes, yet half a size smaller and nimbler than key rivals and previously boasting a fuel-frugal diesel option, it came closer than any of its peers to matching my values.”

Redesigned last year, the new-generation GLS has gotten bigger. But its American competitors have too, so it’s still relatively handy in size – at 5,207 mm long, closer to a BMW X7 than a Lincoln Navigator. The diesel option fell victim to the VW TDI-gate scandal years ago, however, leaving two turbocharged gasoline engine options for 2020 – a 3.0-litre inline six in the GLS 450, a 4.0-litre V8 in the GLS 580, both with 48V electric-assist mild-hybrid technology.

Open this photo in gallery The GLS got bigger with its redesign last year. Jeremy Sinek/The Globe and Mail

Our first exposure to the new GLS last year demonstrated its off-road capability in Utah (a so-called Enhanced Towing Package adds, among other items, a dual-range transfer case and underside protection for some serious off-road cred). This time, we spent a week just tooling around the Toronto area.

Although still recognizably a GLS, the new shape’s softer contours are arguably less distinctive than its sharper-creased predecessor. Wheels start at a large 21 inches, and go up to 23s. Our GLS 580 test sample (base price $117,300) was on optional 22s and decked-out with premium-seating, technology and inteilligent-drive packages for a total MSRP of $133,500.

Most of the upsizing has benefitted the second row, creating expansive legroom with the seats (a choice of 60:40 bench or captain’s chairs) fully back. The aforementioned premium-rear-seating package adds five-zone climate control, second-row MBUX tablet and wireless charging, and more.

Open this photo in gallery It's easy to tailor a commanding view from the driver's seat. Jeremy Sinek/The Globe and Mail

Legroom remans ample even with the second-row seats fully forward, which they need to be to get adults into the back. Even then, I could only just fit my 172-cm frame back there with my knees together, albeit in reasonable comfort; methinks Mercedes’s claim that there’s room for an adult up to 194 cm (6-foot-4) in the third row must involve widely splayed knees.

Passage to the third row is less encumbered than in most SUVs, though the second-row seat is slow to power out of the way and leaves exposed seat rails that could threaten your feet.

Both rows of rear seats can be power folded. The resulting deck isn’t perfectly flat, but according to Mercedes data, there is meaningfully more cargo room (now 470 L), behind the third row while seats-folded volumes have grown minimally. Competitive comparisons are clouded by varying measuring methodologies, but it’s safe to say the GLS matches or beats European and Japanese rivals but is out-volumed by the Americans. A Class-III tow hitch is standard, and the tow rating is 3,500 kilograms.

Open this photo in gallery Mercedes says the GLS has 470 L of cargo volume behind the rear seats. Jeremy Sinek/The Globe and Mail

Up front, it’s easy to tailor a throne-like posture with commanding visibility, if you can take your eyes off the Mercedes-signature super-wide screen that comprises the virtual gauge cluster and the interface for MBUX (Mercedes-Benz User Experience infotainment system). The latter can be interfaced by direct touch or via a separate touch pad, and there are still plenty of physical buttons for most basic functions. I never did figure out, though, how to adjust the (optional) head-up display. Also requiring a learning curve is the slender stalk on the right of the steering column: it’s the gear selector, not a wiper switch.

If you’re looking for an SUV that drives like an S-Class limo, the powertrain gets closer than the chassis. Performance delivered by the 483-horsepower V8 merits the “iron fist in a velvet glove” metaphor. In track mode, Mercedes claims 0-100 km/h in an assertive 5.3 seconds; in cruise, ninth gear delivers 120 km/h at a serene, loping 1,650 rpm. Even with a boost from the electric motor, however, there is still a hint of lag below 2,500 rpm. And fuel consumption – 15 L/100 km in our hands – won’t win any Green Car awards.

On the standard air-spring suspension, the chassis impressed us more for its handling (surprisingly wieldy and engaging for its size and weight) than for its ride, which seemed better controlled in Dynamic mode than Comfort but still occasionally sent shudders through the structure. Perhaps smaller wheels and/or the optional active suspension would deliver a suppler ride.

Open this photo in gallery Name a driver-assist technology, and it's probably available on the GLS. Jeremy Sinek/The Globe and Mail

Let’s not even try to list all the infotainment, connectivity and driver-assist technologies: it’s a high-end Mercedes, so suffice to say that if the feature isn’t standard or available, it probably hasn’t been invented yet. That all said, for us the technology was sometimes more annoying than assistive. The voice control occasionally responded to commands we had not made yet took repeated attempts to execute a simple “dial number” request. And the driver-assist technologies were sometimes over-reactive – shrieking alarm at the hydrangeas bordering my driveway – or intervened for no apparent reason. Perhaps we would have been better off without the test sample’s optional MBUX Interior Assistant (basically, gesture control) and the Intelligent Drive package that pushes the envelope of almost-autonomous driving.

Technology niggles aside, it’s tough to top the sense of security and well-being you experience at the wheel of this high-and-mighty Mercedes. And notwithstanding our twinges of guilt at the gas pump (R.I.P. the diesel), it still represents the classy “old money” alternative in a peer group of mostly bling-dripping nouveau-riche status symbols.

Nothing says summer like a Ford Mustang convertible. It’s the ideal ride for nostalgic baby boomers looking to recapture their youth. The iconic Mustang is retro in its design, yet modern and muscular with high-tech features and an affordable price tag.

The base convertible, powered by a 2.3-litre turbocharged EcoBoost four-cylinder engine, starts at $32,080. Personally, I’d skip it and move up the ladder to the GT trim. At $47,805, it gets a powerful 5.0-litre V8 engine with 460 horsepower and 420 lb.-ft. of torque. It even comes with a six-speed manual transmission. A 10-speed automatic is optional. There’s also room for four adults and 324 litres of cargo space.

Be careful opening the two long doors. In tight parking spots, it will be easy to ding other vehicles.

2020 Mazda MX-5

If you’re single or a newlywed with no baggage – meaning kids or pets – the Mazda MX-5 is a cute, compact two-seat roadster that spells serious summer fun. Top up or down, it’s attractive from every angle. It’s also lightweight, nimble, well-balanced and sporty, thanks to its 2.0-litre inline four-cylinder engine with 181 horsepower and 151 lb.-ft. of torque driving the rear wheels.

The soft top with a glass rear window is easy to open or close. But if you prefer a hardtop, go for the MX-5 RF, short for Retractable Fastback. Its power roof opens and closes in less than 15 seconds.

Trunk space is tight with only 130 litres of capacity, so stick to short, quick day trips. Prices start at $33,100 for the MX-5 GS RWD with a six-speed manual. The MX-5 RF starts at $40,100.

For thrill-seeking millennials eager to get off the beaten track, the Jeep Wrangler won’t disappoint. Its go-anywhere, off-road capability adds fun to the mix by transforming from an SUV to a quasi-convertible. The roof and doors come off and the windshield folds down for a true open-air experience. Sure, it takes elbow grease, time and patience to remove the roof and doors, but once that’s done, you’re basking in the sun with the wind in your hair. Plus, it’s a true off-roader, able to tackle anything in its path from water fording to rock climbing.

Prices start at $36,295 for the two-door Wrangler Sport. Skip the two-door models and go for a four-door – it’s more practical and easier to get into the back seats.

Porsche 718 Boxster

Porsches aren’t cheap, but they definitely make a bold statement on the road. The mid-engine 718 Boxster has a new GTS 4.0 trim for 2021 – it’s ideal if you’re recently divorced or going through a midlife crisis and want to turn heads. With serious power, two cozy seats, rear-wheel drive, and a soft-top roof that opens or closes in less than 10 seconds, it’s a hit.

At its heart is a four-litre six-cylinder boxer engine with 394 horsepower and 309 lb.-ft. of torque. It’s powerful and fast, hitting 100 kilometres an hour in only 4.5 seconds. Add a vibrant shade of green or blue and you’ll be impossible to miss. Keep in mind, there’s little room for luggage – the frunk, or front trunk, has enough room for a purse. Prices start at $96,900.

For eco-conscious families who want to go green, an electric vehicle like the Tesla Model Y fits the bill. Smaller than Tesla’s Model X SUV, the Model Y has traditional doors – no gimmicky rear-rising gull-wings. It seats five, but a seven-seat version is expected later this year.

The electric range is impressive. The all-wheel-drive long-range model can travel up to 509 kilometres and go from zero to 100 kilometres an hour in 4.8 seconds. Tesla’s supercharger network system, which makes charging fast and easy on the road, is expanding across Canada. The stations let you recharge the battery quickly – restoring about 275 kilometres of range in 15 minutes. Currently, Tesla has about 155 supercharger stations in Canada, most of them in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia. Prices start at $68,600.

2021 Toyota Sienna

Shocked to see a minivan on this list? Usually minivans aren’t “cool,” but the 2021 Toyota Sienna is an exception. Inside, an optional refrigerator not only keeps beverages cold, it can keep ice cream frozen, too. After the kids make a mess inhaling their cones and other goodies, a built-in vacuum cleaner makes cleanups quick and effortless. It also has a larger rear-entertainment system, 18 cupholders, seven USB keys and 10 airbags.

Getting inside is easier, too. Open or close the rear sliding doors by kicking under the door – no key required. The second-row captain’s chairs also slide forward and back by up to 25 inches for extra room to stretch out. Prices aren’t available yet. But it goes on sale later this year.

When you first meet Giulia, she comes across as a bit of a prima donna. Sheʼs a bit flighty and seems to need a lot of attention.

Yes, we’re talking about a car. Alfa Romeo introduced the Giulia sports sedan to the world in the most exuberant and romantic fashion back in 2015. Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli dedicated a love poem to the car and sang the aria Nessun Dorma from Pucciniʼs Turandot as the prototype was revealed. Hearts soared and tears were shed in a thoroughly delightful, over-the-top debut.

At the time, Alfa Romeo made much of the Giuliaʼs pedigree and the two years that the companyʼs “skunk works” team of engineers, designers and stylists spent in isolation, working tirelessly to create the car.

Fast forward to the 2020 Giulia Quadrifoglio, the flagship four-door grand touring sedan from the Italian automaker, which is now part of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA). Given the hype at the carʼs debut and the companyʼs history of making beautiful, fast cars, the bar is high.

The Giulia certainly does not disappoint. At first blush, itʼs a vehicle that seems to need a lot of attention. The body is a stunning pearlescent white that nobody without a personal detailer or a serious car-cleaning obsession should buy.

Fortunately, there are other colours to choose from, including proper Alfa Red.

The impression continues when you get behind the wheel. A dizzying array of electronic controls – upgraded for this model year with a larger 8.8-inch touch screen and myriad customizable views of everything from navigation to the carʼs real-time performance numbers – could be considered distracting in a driverʼs car.

This particular test car was equipped with $8,000 Brembo carbon ceramic brakes. In stop-and-go driving, they are twitchy and overly grabby. For the first few blocks, slowing for traffic and lights was an alarmingly herky-jerky experience. They come into their own on the highway, however, slowing the car smoothly and without drama.

And thatʼs where the Giulia began to grow on me. Once we hit the freeway, the carʼs true Alfa colours emerged.

This car shines on the open road. The eight-speed automatic transmission delivers power from the 505-horsepower V6 twin-turbo engine to the rear wheels so smoothly that shifts are imperceptible, unless you decide to manage them yourself using the paddle shifters in either Race or Dynamic mode. Then the Quadrifoglio becomes a beast anxious to tear up the road and outrun whatever is around, issuing tremendous snorting resonance from the exhaust.

The engine is Ferrari-derived, the most powerful ever installed in an Alfa. The company boasts that the Giulia currently holds the speed record for five-passenger sedans around Germanyʼs famed Nurburgring racetrack.

Handling is surefooted thanks to the 50-50 front-to-rear weight distribution, adaptive suspension and torque-vectoring differential. In the real world, this lets the car boogie over winding, hilly roads or stretch its legs at eye-watering highway speeds.

In an odd gambit, FCA has decided to market this fast, racy model as a combination sports car and grocery-getter. In a July press briefing, Alfa Romeo North Americaʼs brand manager Steve Richards called the Giulia a “daily-driven performance car.” He envisions buyers dropping the kids at school, taking it to work and being able to go road-tripping on weekends.

Heʼs got a point – the Giulia is surely capable of doing all that. But isnʼt every four-door sedan and SUV on the market today? Using the Giulia Quadrifoglio as a daily driver is a waste of its true aptitudes.

While the Giulia is temperamental in stop-and-go traffic, at speed its minor flaws can be forgiven. Where itʼs important – handling and road manners – the car is every bit the star that Alfa Romeo envisioned at the launch five years ago. And while it could certainly be a competent grocery-getter, the Giulia works best as a go-to companion for a spirited run on the open road.

Looks

Open this photo in gallery The Giulia's long, sloping snout and sporty vents give it a classic grand-touring look. Emily Atkins/The Globe and Mail

The Giulia is very much a European-style Grand Touring sedan. Its long sloping snout, sporty vents and intricate Alfa trefoil grilles make it distinctive on approach, but from the back, its broad behind and short rear overhang are fairly typical design elements for cars in this class. Running on 19-inch wheels is a welcome change from the overly large rims some manufacturers choose for their flagship vehicles, and they create satisfying proportions for the Giulia.

Interior

Open this photo in gallery The interior has a welcoming combination of dark suede and leather surfaces. Emily Atkins/The Globe and Mail

This Giuliaʼs dark suede and leather surfaces, combined with carbon-fibre accents, is welcoming, cool and calming. Its simple design is understated and elegant with double rows of contrasting stitching. The seats are extremely comfortable, with extendable seat cushions for the driver and front passenger, and supportive bolstering. Rear leg room is lacking, however; only people with shorter legs would be comfortable there for long.

Performance

Boasting a zero-to-100 launch in 3.8 seconds, the Giulia Quadrifoglio is packed with torque and handling. Coupled with a butter-smooth eight-speed automatic, paddle shifters and drive-mode selector that moves from eco to race, the car delivers performance that progresses from stately to electrifying, depending on your mood.

Technology

For 2020, the carʼs new, larger touch screen is highly legible and offers customizable displays. Smartphone integration is quick, but the interface is made more complicated by the multiple access controls – the screen, console knobs and steering wheel buttons – for various functions. On the safety side, the 2020 model has newly integrated level-2 autonomy.

Cargo

Open this photo in gallery The low-ceilinged trunk benefits from a pass-through to the rear seats. Emily Atkins/The Globe and Mail

The Giuliaʼs trunk has a low ceiling but is deep from front to back, with a generous opening. This limits its ability to accommodate bulky items, although it does have a pass-through into the passenger compartment to handle skis. Itʼs sufficient for a car in this class, but doesnʼt quite measure up to Alfa’s all-rounder claim.

The verdict

The Giulia Quadrifoglio is a handsome, versatile driverʼs car with a few quirks that do not detract from its performance or value.

I have a neighbour who cancelled his insurance during COVID-19 but has started driving without it. I imagine there are more people like this out there. So what happens if my car gets hit by one of these idiots without insurance? Am I still covered? Are there limits on the coverage? – Suresh, Hamilton

As long as you have insurance, you have some coverage if an uninsured driver hits your car – but there could be limits.

“If you can identify the vehicle and the driver confirms they have no insurance, then the provincial policies give you some coverage,” says Pete Karageorgos, director of consumer and industry relations at the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC). “You’ll need to notify the authorities as soon as possible because they need to conduct an investigation.”

Everywhere in Canada, car insurance is mandatory – you have to be insured.

But because people break the law, all insurance policies in provinces with private insurance include uninsured automobile coverage.

It doesn’t mean you have unlimited coverage in a crash with an uninsured motorist; it will depend on what coverage you purchased.

""The Ontario Automobile Insurance Policy outlines that uninsured automobile coverage will respond for up to $25,000 for accidental damage to the vehicle and/or its contents, subject to a $300 deductible,"" said Hans Reidl, senior vice-president, claims with Economical Insurance, in an e-mail. ""If you have optional collision or upset coverage, your policy will respond over and above this up to the liability limit.""

So, if your Tesla is worth $70,000 and it was totalled by an uninsured driver, you would pay the deductible and be covered for $24,700 under the policy.

If you had purchased collision coverage, then most companies would cover the remaining $45,000 – even though collision coverage normally only covers damage to your car when you're the one at fault.

If you make a collision claim after being hit by an uninsured driver, you would also see a hike to your rates, even though you weren't at fault.

Story continues below advertisement

What if you don't have collision insurance? Then you would have to sue for that $35,000.

""You must seek recovery from the uninsured driver by way of civil action,"" Reidl says.

If it's a hit and run where you don't know who hit you, then it would be treated like a normal insurance claim and you'd be covered, Reidl says.

Insurance rules vary by province, but in most provinces, your collision insurance would cover the vehicle damage if you're hit by an uninsured driver.

Rest assured?

But what if you're badly hurt in a crash with an uninsured driver?

Here's where it gets even more complicated. In Ontario, you would be covered by the accident benefits in your policy in any crash, whether you hit someone, someone hits you or a boulder landed on your car.

Story continues below advertisement

For catastrophic injuries, such as paralysis or serious brain injury, you can sue an at-fault driver for wage losses and additional medical treatments.

If that driver doesn't have insurance, then you would draw from the uninsured automobile coverage in your policy, up to a limit of $200,000.

If damages to your vehicle and your injuries total more than $200,000, 95 per cent will go to injuries and 5 per cent will go to the loss of the car.

For instance, if your $20,000 car is destroyed in a crash and you and your spouse need $350,000 in accident benefits, your insurance company would pay $190,000 for your injuries (95 per cent of the total) and $10,000 for the loss of your car.

That’s true even if you have $1-million in liability on your policy – unless you purchased optional family protection coverage, which is typically under $50 a year. In Ontario, it’s called OPCF 44R.

That would cover you for the amount of liability coverage on your policy.

Story continues below advertisement

Insurance rules vary by province, but in most provinces, your collision insurance would cover damage to your car if you're hit by an uninsured driver.

The rules on compensation for injuries in crashes caused by uninsured drivers vary in the other provinces. In Alberta, for instance, your insurance provides up to $50,000 in benefits for two years after the crash. If you use up that coverage, or if you don't have insurance, you can access the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims (MVAC) program.

“The MVAC program then provides medical benefits up to a limit of $95,000 per individual,”said Jerrica Goodwin, spokeswoman for Alberta’s Treasury Board, in an e-mail.

Two years is a long time for any vehicle to sit unattended. Seizing brakes, cracked belts and hoses and fluids that have become laden with moisture are just some problems universal to any car that sits. With the vehicle in question being a hybrid, the chances of there being problems is elevated.

The battery minder will slow down the sulfation of your smaller 12-volt battery but not stop it completely. However, this is not a big issue. I’d be concerned about the high-voltage hybrid-battery system, as it will likely become depleted over that extended period. Ideally, if you can contact a friendly neighbour and ask them to drive it for a week or two every six months, this will alleviate most concerns. If this is not possible, then I think you definitely need to get the dealer you mentioned involved, preferably at the midway point.

My VVT-i 2000 BEAMS engine has made a knock sound since the mechanic replaced the timing belt. When I asked him why the sound was happening, he said the head requires shimming. Please help me.

Thank you,

Godfrey

Breakthrough Engine with Advanced Mechanism System (BEAMS) was available in Lexus and Toyota products in Japan and some European markets. I’m not familiar with any of these 2000-cc engines because I don’t believe any made their way to North America, so I am going to assume this reader is on another continent.

Story continues below advertisement

Regardless of this, some things are just universal and don’t require specific product knowledge. I believe that with the statement “knock sound,” you are referring to pre-ignition or ping. The fact that this started after the timing belt was replaced suggests to me that the timing belt was likely installed incorrectly and is now sitting one tooth off.

I have never shimmed a head, nor would I recommend that it ever be done, other than in a racing engine application where a compression ratio needs to be addressed. Go back to your mechanic and insist he revisit his work. If he resists, then you will have to seek a second opinion from another repair facility. Good luck, Godfrey.

What’s on my radar

As internal combustion engines become more complicated, your vehicle’s Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) can illuminate for an ever-increasing amount of reasons. One such item is a newer technology feature commonly known as Variable Valve Timing (VVT), which made its first production-car appearance in the 1990s. Outside of the enthusiast crowd, not many understand this technology, so here is the Lou-lowdown of what it is. That way, if faced with a VVT repair, you’ll at least have a basic idea of what is going on.

For those of you old enough to remember the golden age of muscle cars, one of the most common and easiest engine modifications was to upgrade the exhaust and carburetor. However, serious car enthusiasts often didn’t didn’t stop there and also replaced the stock engine camshaft with a high-lift performance camshaft.

Everyone on the street knew which car had the performance camshaft installed, because sitting behind that car at a set of traffic lights would make your eyes water from the raw fuel smell spewing from their exhaust. The point of the performance camshaft was to make engine valves open further and longer. Enthusiasts liked it because the engine was more powerful when needed, but a downside was that when the engine was idling, it struggled to stay running because it now had too much fuel, hence the reason for the strong odour.

Enter VVT. Some smart engineers started designing engines with camshafts and timing systems that could offer the best of both worlds. They designed a camshaft that had both a normal camshaft profile and a performance profile built into one device. The result was a fuel-efficient car that idled perfectly and also benefited from the extra power provided by a performance camshaft. Every manufacturer now has their own version of it, and just about every newer car on the road makes use of it.

Story continues below advertisement

Engine oil performs double duty in VVT engines. It lubricates and is also used to hydraulically drive the various components that make VVT systems work. Because of that, most problems related to VVT usually have something to do with the oil system and lack of proper maintenance. Extended oil-change intervals don’t help either. Be forewarned, as the importance of being on time with your next oil change is of utmost importance on these engines.

He’s now working from home and will stay working from home after COVID, so he’ll drive his car only on weekends. I need my car all week. He doesn’t want to drive my Fiat because it’s too small – he’s 6-foot-5, and I’m 5-foot4. If we sell them both, can you recommend one car to replace them that will make us both happy? – Alisha

Gentile: Alisha, I don’t blame your husband for not wanting to drive your Fiat. He definitely is too big for its smaller dimensions. I know it must be difficult to get rid of two cars, which you clearly both like, but in today’s reality, I think It’s a smart idea.

Richardson: I’m guessing that Alisha and her hubby are doing this to save some money, since the ideal solution is just to keep the Mustang as a Sunday driver. That’s an expensive luxury, though. Factor in insurance and maintenance, and those few kilometres on a Sunday get really costly.

Story continues below advertisement

Gentile: Exactly. And Alisha might not like driving the Mustang. It’s way bigger than her little Fiat. She’ll be driving the most, so they’re better off getting a vehicle she’s comfortable in, too.

Richardson: Actually, the seats on a Mustang have a long range of movement, so it would probably fit them both well. I just drove one and loved it. My wife, however, thought it was stupid. She hated that I kept leaving the exhaust sound on Track, which is pretty loud. She told me I was compensating for something.

Gentile: And she would know. But this is a done deal, Mark – both the Mustang and the Fiat are being sold.

Richardson: So their new car probably doesn’t have to be big, but it does have to accommodate both tall and not-so-tall drivers. And it should probably be peppy. Both the ‘Stang and the 500 are fun to drive, so how about a larger Fiat, like the 500L?

Gentile: I like the idea of a larger hatchback like the 500L; it’s spacious with plenty of head- and legroom for taller drivers and passengers. But I’m not a big fan of the ride and handling. It’s a bit choppy and rough over bumps and other degradations on the road. It’s definitely not as fun to drive as a Mustang.

Richardson: The advantage is that Alisha already has a relationship with her Fiat dealer, and the 500L keeps the style of the 500 she says she loves. But maybe she doesn’t like her dealer. What else gives a bit of Euro style with some size and agility?

Gentile: The Mini Countryman might fit the bill for both hubby and wife. It’s stylish, spacious and fun to drive – like a go-Kart! Her hubby would really love it.

Richardson: He probably would. I drove the Countryman a few years ago with my buddy Wade, and he’s a tall guy, so I’m sure Alisha’s hubby would fit. He can try it for size at any dealership, of course, and there’s a new edition for 2021, so he may get a good deal on this year’s models. But Mustang to Mini … those are very different images, and as a guy, that could be quite the jump for the husband to accept.

Gentile: I disagree. I see a lot of guys driving Minis. I think he’ll like its ride and handling - it’s definitely way more fun to drive than a Fiat. So what do you think would be a better “image” for her husband?

Richardson: I’m sure he’d enjoy the larger Mini too. It’s got plenty of rally and performance cred. But if he’s a Mustang guy, he might prefer the looks of a Toyota Camry XSE. Now that’s a surprisingly sporty-looking car that starts around $35,000 and would be practical enough for both of them.

Gentile: Camry? Really? Granted, it’s no ordinary-looking Camry, but it’s still a Toyota. I don’t think he’ll want to go from a Mustang to a Camry. That’ll do nothing for his image. I’m thinking maybe a Subaru WRX?

Richardson: Hmm - I’d forgotten about the WRX. It does get pushed to the side sometimes, but owners love them for their sportiness without being niche. And Subaru’s a bit of an underdog, which would probably satisfy any image concerns of selling out to the mainstream.

Gentile: It would. My pick is the WRX. They’ll both enjoy it!

Richardson: The WRX is right on the money at about $32,000 to start. It’s not so cute like the Mini nor so parental like the Camry. It’s kind of plain on the inside, though, and nowhere near as stylish as either the 500 or the Mustang. These guys might find its looks boring. They also don’t need its all-wheel drive.

Gentile: They don’t need it, but it’s a nice bonus to have in the wintertime. Alisha will appreciate it. And her hubby will enjoy the drive – more sporty than a Mini, Camry or Fiat, for that matter.

When the 80th annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally opens Aug. 7 in South Dakota, it will probably be the largest gathering of humanity anywhere in the world this year. Organizers expect a quarter of a million people to attend over its 10 days. This is about half the number of last year’s attendees, but it still promises to be a raucous blend of loud bikes, louder bars and loudest-of-all rock bands, with daily races and nightly concerts throughout the week.

“The City of Sturgis Motorcycle Rally is an icon of American Freedom and Independence,” said the City Council in a June press release that confirmed the rally would go ahead, despite daily increases in recorded cases of the COVID-19 virus.

American Free-dumb, more like. The Black Hills will be a petri dish of contagion, spreading back through the United States after the partying rally-goers return home in mid-August. Contact tracing will be near-impossible and pointless. When American death rates surge in September among bikers and the countless people with whom they’ve come into contact, the blame will fall on the change of seasons, just as President Trump predicted months ago.

The City of Sturgis didn’t enter into this lightly. It spent several months surveying rally exhibitors, merchants and potential participants before making a commitment. It sent out a postal survey to the 7,000 residents of the small city, about an hour west of Rapid City and north of Mount Rushmore, and 62 per cent of the responses called for the rally to be either postponed or cancelled. But then, according to the local Sioux Falls Argus Leader, the city received a letter from a Rapid City merchandiser reminding it that a federal judge had ruled that no single entity “owns, produces or operates” the rally. If the city tried to shut things down, it would be “subject to claims of liability.”

In a good year, the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally can earn close to US$800-million for the region. Money talks. The city voted to go ahead with it, residents be damned.

Besides, the rally is so huge that its participants spread themselves at least a hundred kilometres in all directions into the region’s restaurants, bars, hotels and campgrounds. Even if the town closed shop and barricaded its borders, riders would still come to western South Dakota to celebrate their American freedom. Before the city announced its decision, the massive Buffalo Chip Campground just past the edge of town announced it would be open for business, with BBQ pits, bike shows and concerts featuring more than 20 bands, including Smash Mouth, Buckcherry and even The Guess Who. It’s not quite business as usual, though – there’ll be hand-washing stations throughout the grounds.

So far, South Dakota has fared much better than most in the fight against COVID-19. The state is large, rural and lightly populated. It’s one of only two states, along with neighbouring Iowa, that does not have a mandatory requirement to wear a mask in public places. When President Trump came to Mount Rushmore on July 3 to celebrate the eve of Independence Day, the state’s Republican governor, Kristi Noem, told Fox News there would be no physical distancing and masks would be optional. Apparently, there was no outbreak of COVID-19 afterward among the 7,500 attendees, reinforcing the governor’s convictions.

The Sturgis rally organizers are being a little more cautious. They’ve cancelled the opening parade and the B1 bomber flypast that each draw huge, pressing crowds, and groups of people will be asked to stand at least six feet apart. They’re encouraging vendors to wear masks. There will be hand-washing stations at every street corner, and only half the maximum number of people allowed by the fire marshal to enter a building will be permitted inside.

Besides, “there have been many huge rodeos and parades and just a lot of stuff all summer long,” a rally spokesperson told South Dakota’s KTTC News. “We’ve had many large gatherings already this summer with minimal impact, if any.”

But those rodeos and parades don’t attract the hundreds of thousands of bikers who’ll be riding in from hotspot states like Texas, Florida and California. And COVID-19 counts have been steadily rising since May: on the Monday before the rally, the Department of Health reported 65 new cases of COVID-19 in South Dakota, for a total of 946 active cases and just over 9,000 cases recorded so far in the pandemic. There were no new deaths reported to add to the total of just over 130 across the state.

Story continues below advertisement

This will all change when hundreds of thousands of visitors arrive from the rest of the infected country, where there are 60,000 new cases and 1,000 deaths reported each day. The virus’s incubation period of up to two weeks means it won’t really be seen until after the last of the rally-goers fire up their V-twins on August 16 and leave town, most of them riding helmetless as they fan back home across the United States in their celebration of freedom.

After all, Sturgis is a biker rally, one of the biggest. There’ll be burgers and beer and Jack Daniels in hundreds of makeshift bars and around thousands of campfires as the leather-clad, leather-skinned Warriors of the Road stick it to The Man. They’ll be fearless in their defiance of the scourge of the virus, especially if there’s alcohol involved. Which means good luck telling them to stand six feet apart and wash their hands.

This will be their declaration of free-dumb, and all we can do in Canada is shake our heads and keep the border closed.

If this car had a first name, it’d be Darth. Black paint. Black bumpers. No badges out back, just a pair of tail lights like red lightsabers. This is a 1987 Grand National, and it’s one of the most thrilling cars ever made by Buick.

Wait, that can’t be right. Surely a Buick is the sort of car your grandmother drove before she gave up her licence, some beige-coloured sedan with styling like a used bar of soap and a suspension made of butterscotch pudding. Buicks aren’t cool, surely?

They used to be. Buick once built cars like the commanding and chrome-laden Roadmaster, or the gorgeous 1960s Riviera. There was the Wildcat, the Electra, the GSX with its massive V8. Buicks had performance and prestige, and in 1987, you could stroll down to your local Buick dealership to buy an all-black Buick that could blow the scissor doors off a Lamborghini Countach.

That’s not hyperbole. In 1987, a Grand National was tested by Car and Driver and accelerated from zero to 60 miles an hour in 4.9 seconds. It was a tenth or two of a second faster than the results for either the Countach or the Ferrari Testarossa, two of the greatest cars to ever grace a poster.

The pride of Italy was stomped all over by a General Motors product with cushy seats and an automatic transmission, those screaming V12s humbled by a growly pushrod V6 from Michigan. Suddenly, kids in the late 1980s started putting different posters up on their walls.

This particular example is a 1987 Grand National, which in its day was rated at 245 horsepower and 355 lb.-ft. of torque. It has belonged to Winston Lui since 1991, and he’s kept it carefully preserved, with a few very rare options. He drives and enjoys it regularly, however, having put more than 100,000 kilometres under its wheels over the years. A member of the local Buick Grand National Racing Association Car Club, he usually brings his car out on cruises and meets.

“I really love seeing them all together,” Lui says. “You roll up, and people just stop and stare.”

As we stand next to his car at the bottom of the hill, a hot-rodded Chevy pickup drives past and flashes a thumbs-up. People who know their cars know what a Grand National is, even with its very discreet badging.

The Buick Grand National takes its name from NASCAR, where the “Grand National” was the name of the racing championship before the tobacco sponsors arrived and it became the Winston Cup. It’s since been named the Cup Series. In 1981 and 1982, Darrell Waltrip raced Mountain Dew-liveried Buick Regals to series victory, and Buick’s marketing department saw an opportunity.

Open this photo in gallery The Grand National took its name and inspiration from stock-car racing. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

Happily, so did Buick’s engineers. One, named Ken Baker, had already hit on turbocharging as an experimental way to boost the power of smaller V6 engines to match V8 outputs. He got the go-ahead to build a pace car for the 1976 Indy 500. American racing legend Dan Gurney, who’d won at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, drove it so quickly around the track that the tires were worn out in just four laps.

Story continues below advertisement

Baker’s vision and the timing of Waltrip’s victories were a perfect match for Buick. By 1984, Buick was selling an all-black two-door sedan with performance that was just a hair or two behind the Corvette. By 1987, the last year of production, a Grand National owner might grin cheekily over at a Corvette at the dragstrip, knowing that the Buick was actually the fastest car GM currently produced.

Thank turbocharging for the boost. Exhaust gases drive a turbine connected by a shaft to a compressor. That compressor spins, ramming air into the Grand National’s 3.8-litre V6 engine, the air first passing through an intercooler to scrub off some of the power-sapping heat. Under hard acceleration, Lui’s Grand National whistles like a kettle, scorching off down the road.

Open this photo in gallery A turbocharged 3.8-litre engine gives the Grand National its power. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

Factory performance was fierce, but the Grand National really came alive when the hot-rodders got their hands on the blacked-out Buicks. Some of the local club members have doubled the car’s power by increasing the boost pressure, improving exhaust flow and fitting it with larger turbochargers.

In this way, the Grand National forms a sort of bridge between different car cultures. On one hand, it’s a true muscle car, one of the last of the breed. Its steering and handling are rooted firmly in the 1970s, with its aging G-body General Motors architecture. The braking is also not quite as stout as the performance. The Grand National is all about straight-line speed.

On the other hand, it’s a forward-looking car. Turbocharged V6s are found in countless performance sedans these days. The Grand National is a link between domestic hot-rodders and the turbo-obsessed import-enthusiast crowd. It’s a Buick that appeals to anyone with a need for speed.

Open this photo in gallery The Grand National was all about straight-line speed, in the tradition of American muscle cars. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

Further, the Grand National is still very much part of popular culture. You can see one owned by “Killer” Mike Render, one half of the rap duo Run The Jewels. It’s featured in the music video for their just-released song Ooh La La. Render unlocks the trunk to reveal cases of champagne. It’s a Buick worth celebrating.

As a last hurrah, just before production ended, Buick took 547 Grand Nationals off the line and handed them to ASC/McLaren, a specialist builder. The result was the GNX, the fastest and best handling of the Grand Nationals. A GNX is highly collectible today, with a low-mileage version worth as much as $200,000 at auction.

Interesting, yes, but not quite as cool as the Grand Nationals of Lui and his fellow club members. These are the cars that you’ll see out there on sunny summer evenings or bright weekend morning runs. They’re the rumble and whistle of GM’s past. They’re a living reminder that Buick used to be cool. It used to have a dark side.

Pickup trucks used to be simple and utilitarian: a bare-bones cab and a big empty box behind it. And while theyʼve kept the utility, they’re by no means simple any more. With pickups now the top-selling vehicles in North America, automakers have taken great strides to make their offerings more advanced – and not just under the hood or behind the wheel.

In the past few years, manufacturers have been adding features to the bed and tailgate to appeal to those on the job site, making their trucks more useful than ever before.

Letʼs see how their offerings compare.

Ford

With the recent release of the 14th generation of its best-selling F-150, Ford is the latest manufacturer to put more thought into what used to be just a place to haul your stuff. The Detroit automaker introduced an aluminum bed a few years ago, the first for any pickup, but with the new 2021 F-150, they’ve added more features aimed directly at tradespeople and those who enjoy the outdoors.

Open this photo in gallery The F-150 comes standard with new cleats mounted to the sides of the tailgate to act as tie-down locations for extra-long items in the bed. Courtesy of manufacturer

New is the Pro Power Onboard feature, basically a power generator with 120-volt plugs at the back of the bed. Normal gas-engine F-150s can generate 2.0 kilowatts, good for power saws and such. But opt for the hybrid pickup, and you would have a standard 2.4-kW output or an optional 7.2-kW system, which adds a 240-volt, 30-amp outlet suitable for welding, running a large camp trailer or other high-energy applications. What’s more, you can control all of this with an app on your phone.

Ford has also added the Tailgate Work Surface, a relatively flat top on the dropped tailgate that includes indentations to hold pencils, cups and even a tablet, which are somewhat superfluous. But what is really handy are the cleats on the sides of the gate to hold down longer items, as well as pockets to attach clamps for when you might want to cut wood off the gate. It also retains the retractable step and grab bar from the last generation, which are becoming necessary for climbing into the back as today’s trucks get higher and higher.

GMC

Making its debut on the 2019 GMC Sierra Denali, the Multipro Gate has six different positions, making it one of the most versatile tailgates on the market.

An inner gate can fold down to make a smaller, 48-inch workspace, which could be used while standing to use a computer. That same small gate can fold up when the larger gate is down to act as a stop for longer materials. With the larger gate folded down, the inner gate can fold down again to be used as a step. You can also opt for integrated speakers for the ultimate tailgate party.

The gate isn’t the GMC’s utility space’s only trick, as you can also order the whole bed in carbon fibre, a first for pickups, which reduces the overall weight of the Sierra by more than 27 kilograms.

Ram

Anyone needing more lockable storage space could look at optional RamBox lockers, found on either side of the Ram’s bed. While they do cut into the cargo area, the truck can still haul the ubiquitous 4-foot-by-8-foot sheet of plywood. The boxes are locked with the key fob, and have interior lighting and even a drain plug, so you can fill them with ice and beverages and be more popular than the Sierra at that tailgate party.

Ram also offers the Multifunction tailgate. While it swings down, as on a traditional truck, it also swings open to the sides in a 60/40 split to give easier access to the bed.

Honda

Honda’s Ridgeline is a medium-sized pickup, more for personal use than for heavy-duty work. But it also has clever ways to make it more useful. Under the bed at the very back is a lockable trunk with 206 litres of space, enough for a load of groceries or some luggage. And to make access to that trunk easier, the tailgate, which swings down traditionally, also swings out to the left.

Nissan

While every truck comes with fixed tie-down points to hook your straps or bungee cords, Nissan’s full-sized Titan and Titan XD, as well as its medium-sized Frontier, have a unique five-track rail system called Utili-track. Two rails in the bed floor, and rails in the sides and front of the bed allow tie-down cleats to be positioned wherever they’re needed. Also, those side rails accommodate various accessories, such as lockable boxes that can slide from front to back.

According to a cursory search on the internet, the Qashqai are a nomadic, Turkic-language-speaking people who settled in the mountains of southwestern Iran in the 15th century. When the border with the United States reopens to travellers, feel free to trot out this little fact for Americans puzzled by the badge on the back of the small crossover that’s sold as the Rogue Sport down there.

“Surprised you didn’t know that,” you can say. “Common knowledge, really. And the name’s pronounced CASH-kai.”

On a family camping trip a few hours northeast of Vancouver, the Qashqai’s Canadian name proved to be fitting. Nissan’s compact crossover is not particularly sporty, but with solid fuel economy and a comfortable ride, it will work well if you’re a bit nomadic yourself.

That is, as long as you’re not a nomad in a hurry. With a modest 141 horsepower from its 2.0-litre, four-cylinder engine, the Qashqai offers adequate acceleration but is unhappy to be rushed. The feel of Nissan’s continuously variable transmission (CVT) is far more responsive than it has been in the past. Programmed shift points that artificially mimic a conventional transmission mean there is less of a “rubber-band” lag when you accelerate or brake.

Steering is very light and a bit numb, but handling is satisfactory. Nipping along some back roads through the rolling-hill country around Merritt, B.C., the Qashqai felt well-composed and light on its feet. Body roll was minimal.

More importantly, the little Nissan displayed refined road manners. Despite 19-inch alloys – large wheels often crash their way over bumps – the Quashqai floated along serenely, better than you’d expect from a compact crossover. Road noise was pleasantly muted.

Open this photo in gallery Even on 19-inch alloy wheels, the Qashqai's ride is comfortable and quiet. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

All the better to enjoy a podcast or two as selected by my five-year-old rear-seat passenger (her favourite: Brains On!, a kids’ science program). The Bose-branded stereo is quite good, helped out by the relatively quiet cabin. Further, the Qashqai now comes standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, just the sort of thing to make road-tripping easier.

Manoeuvring around the campsite – or any parking spot – is made easier by Nissan’s 360-degree camera system. The Qashqai is a popular model in European markets for its small physical footprint and is well-suited to both urban and slightly-more rugged settings. It’s small enough for tight parking garages, yet quiet and comfortable enough to handle highway miles.

Open this photo in gallery The Qashqai has effectively supplanted the Sentra as Nissan's go-to economical family vehicle. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

As the second-most-popular vehicle in Nissan’s lineup after the larger Rogue, the Qashqai has essentially supplanted the Nissan Sentra as a small family car that combines utility and economy. As to the latter, it’ll burn a little more fuel than a compact sedan but returned a respectable 8.0 litres per 100 kilometres in mixed-use driving.

Add in hatchback practicality and available all-wheel drive, and the Qashqai could well serve as the main vehicle for a younger family. Bolt on a roof box for a bit of extra cargo capacity when needed and you’ve got an urban runabout that can handle longer trips.

Call it the Rogue Junior, combining the flexibility that most consumers now expect from a crossover in a more efficient and affordable package. The Nissan Qashqai may have a name that’s hard to pronounce, but its broad appeal is easy to understand.

Looks

Open this photo in gallery The Qashqai received a visual refresh for this model year. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

Refreshed this model year, the Qashqai is a handsome-looking machine, with a profile that’s a little more stylish than the larger Rogue and a little more grown-up than the funky Kicks. Those 19-inch wheels fill the wheel wells out but will add expense when it comes time for tire replacement. The 17-inch wheels on the mid-range SV model look just fine and are a more reasonable choice.

Interior

Open this photo in gallery The Qashqai's interior is comfortable, though feels less upscale than that of some competitors. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

Nissan’s interior game is strong on comfort, a little behind on perceived quality. The Qashqai’s plastics can’t match the upscale appearance of rivals from Hyundai, but its seats are supportive and ideal for long-distance driving.

Performance

The basic front-wheel-drive Qashqai can be ordered with a six-speed manual transmission, but most buyers will go for the automatic shifting option. The Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) is as smooth as anything, but some owners of 2010-2016 Nissans have complained of problems with the reliability of the CVTs in their vehicles. Nissan extended its powertrain warranty in some previous models to 10 years, but here your warranty coverage is an industry-standard five years or 100,000 kilometres. There do not appear to be any specific complaints about the Qashqai’s transmission, but it would be nice to see Nissan stand behind its technology with a longer standard drivetrain warranty.

Technology

Open this photo in gallery Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard features in the Qashqai's infotainment suite. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

Nissan’s advanced driver-assistance suite is called ProPilot Assist. It comes on SL trim models only and includes automated cruise control and lane-keeping assist. Both systems work well and take some of the chores out of slogging your way through city traffic.

Cargo

Open this photo in gallery The trunk floor can be lowered to expand the Qashqai's cargo capacity. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

Active families of four or five are going to want the larger Rogue for the added cargo capacity. However, the Qashqai’s configurable trunk has a floor that can be lowered for a useful 678 L of capacity, flattened out when folding the seats down or divided for the grocery run.

The verdict

Designed for comfort, efficiency and ease-of-use, the Qashqai has plenty of features that make both everyday driving and longer road trips pleasant.

I live in Ontario and recently received a Quebec ticket for going 155 km/h in a 100 km/h zone. I’m old enough to know better, and I’m not very happy with myself. I know that the demerit points will follow me to Ontario, but can Ontario charge me with stunt driving as well? – John

If you live in Ontario, some of what happens in Quebec stays in Quebec.

You won't get charged for a Quebec ticket when you get back to Ontario – but you'll get the demerits and the offence will appear on your Ontario driving record. ""While there would be no [Ontario] fines as the offence did not occur in Ontario, there would be demerit points,"" Lee Alderson, a senior issues advisor with Ontario's Ministry of Transportation (MTO), said in an e-mail.

When you're driving in another province, you are subject to the laws and penalties there.

So you’d have to pay fines, and if the offence comes with an instant suspension, police there would take your licence on the spot.

But unless you’ve been suspended because of a Criminal Code violation, that out-of-province suspension won’t apply at home.

Plus, you won't be suspended or fined again for that same offence in your home province.

That’s true even if you got an out-of-province charge for something that normally comes with a higher penalty back home.

For instance, in Quebec, speeding 50 to 59 km/h over the 100 km/h limit gets you a $290 fine. Because it's less than 60 km/h over the 100 km/h limit, it's not considered excessive speeding in Quebec. But in Ontario, speeding more than 50 km/h over the limit is considered stunt driving and comes with a minimum fine of $2,000, up to six months in jail, a two-year licence suspension and an immediate seven-day suspension when police pull you over.

""The offence would have had to occur in Ontario to be subject to that penalty,"" Alderson says.

Demerits in most provinces

Speeding tickets also come with demerits. Whether you get them for an out-of-province ticket depends on where you live and where you got the ticket.

Most provinces and territories signed the Canadian Driver Licence Compact (CDLC), a 1990 agreement to share demerits and driving records.

So if you live in Alberta and got a speeding ticket in Newfoundland, for instance, it would appear on your record,

But British Columbia, Quebec and Nunavut didn't sign the CDLC.

That means that B.C. and Nunavut don’t share traffic tickets with any other provinces or territories. So if you live outside B.C. and you get a B.C. speeding ticket, you won’t get demerits, and it won’t appear on your driving record.

Likewise, B.C. drivers won't see out-of-province tickets on their records. This only applies to provincial offences. Any driving-related Criminal Code convictions, including impaired driving, appear on your driving record everywhere in Canada.

Story continues below advertisement

While Quebec didn't sign the CDLC either, it has separate agreements to share information with Ontario, Maine and New York.

“Ontario and Quebec have a conviction-exchange agreement where select offences, such as speeding, are sent back to the driver’s home jurisdiction,” Alderson says. “In this example, the information would be sent to Ontario and applied to the offender’s Ontario driving record.”

Like any other conviction, it will stay on your record for three years.

Only certain convictions are shared, including speeding, careless driving, running a red light and racing. You will also get the equivalent demerits added to your licence.

So if you’re an Ontario driver, that Quebec ticket for speeding 55 km/h over the limit will get you six demerits in Ontario, even though the offence only carries five demerits in Quebec.

Demerits affect your licence. For instance, if you get more than 15 demerit points in Ontario, your licence could be suspended for 30 days. Why does all this sharing matter? Once an out-of-province conviction appears on your driving record, your insurance company can use it to raise your rates.

Story continues below advertisement

“If you are convicted of racing or stunt driving, you will now be in the ‘high risk’ insurance market,” said Anne Marie Thomas, senior manager of partner relationships at Insurance Hotline, a rate-comparison site. “The premium increase could be as much as two or three times what you were paying before.”

One lifted wagon, one old-fashioned SUV; on paper, the Outback and the 4Runner are as different as chalk and cheese, night and day, granola or a cheeseburger. However, visit any hiking trailhead in your area, and you’re likely to the same kind of people driving either one of these machines, outfitted with sturdy boots and wearing bright GoreTex. Both seat five, offer solid off-road prowess and have great resale values. Which one’s the best for an outdoorsy family?

Looks

Outback

Open this photo in gallery The Outback maintains the utilitarian styling that has defined the model since its debut in 1994. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

When it first debuted in 1994, the Outback offered an alternative to hulking great SUVs. What it did not attempt to offer is attractive styling, and this latest model is similarly utilitarian. It looks like what it is: a mid-sized wagon with a lifted suspension and some body cladding. If this car could wear cargo shorts and sandals, it would.

In a world where every other crossover comes with a huge grille that looks like it would make julienne fries out of a moose, the Subaru's chunky silhouette is honest. This being the Outdoor model, aimed at younger buyers, there's some blacked-out trim for a sportier appearance. It's a hiking shoe on wheels, and the better for it.

4Runner

If the Outback is the proto-mammal that presaged the rise of car-based crossovers in popularity, then the 4Runner is a dinosaur. Here, in white, it looks like a cross between a Star Wars stormtrooper and a Tonka truck.

Fat tires on dark 17-inch wheels add to the 4Runner’s sandbox-ready appearance, and a roof basket and metal step-rails finish things off in rugged style. It looks basically the same as it has for the last decade.

Interior

Outback

Open this photo in gallery The 11.6-inch touch screen gives the Subaru's interior a 'wow' factor its exterior lacks. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

The Outback’s exterior doesn’t appear to have changed much over the previous model, but the inside is an immediate departure. The “wow” factor is the huge 11.6-inch touch screen, which is quick and functional. Having said that, the trend of having large screens in vehicles is regrettable. They’re distracting. Happily, Subaru’s fitted redundant knobs and buttons for no-look operation.

The Outdoor variant gets a rubbery material covering the seats that is ideal for repelling the various detritus that young children seem to give off. There’s plenty of space for fully-grown kids, too, and the overall quality is a cut above a similarly optioned Forester.

4Runner

Open this photo in gallery The 4Runner's interior looks cheap and plasticky, yet remains charming nonetheless. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

The Toyota's interior doesn't surprise with high-tech features, but is, instead, pretty much the same as it was ten years ago. It looks dated, and a little cheap and plasticky.

Open this photo in gallery The 4Runner's interior has the feeling of old-school Toyota functionality. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

It's also hugely likeable. No, the 4Runner doesn't have a gee-whiz screen, but it gives off the sense that everything in here will still be functioning perfectly in twenty years, no matter what abuse you heap on it. It's old-school Toyota simplicity at its best.

Performance

Outback

Open this photo in gallery The Outback is surprisingly competent off-road. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

Previous versions of the Outback were available with either a normally-aspirated boxer four-cylinder engine or a wonderfully smooth flat-six. The latter has been now replaced with a 2.4-litre turbocharged four. It doesn’t have anything close to the character of the six, but it offers plenty of torque for passing and climbing hills.

Story continues below advertisement

The suspension is soft, but body roll is very well controlled, and the Outback is an ideal highway companion. If your drive to the campsite is a long slog on the freeway followed by an hour of gravel roads, the Subaru will have you still feeling fresh when you get there. It's a bit nimbler than the outgoing model, and the added low-end grunt is excellent.

Off-road, the Outback is surprisingly competent. Rutted tracks, mud, or dry and sandy conditions are shrugged off with ease. Subaru's X-mode simplifies everything to the point that not much experience is necessary to traverse some seriously gnarly terrain. For ordinary explorers, there's little that the Outback won't be able to handle.

4Runner

Open this photo in gallery The 4Runner is nearly unstoppable on off-road terrain. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

While the Toyota Tacoma benefits from a new V6 and a six-speed automatic transmission, the 4Runner is still stomping around with a fairly outdated powertrain. It feels ponderous on the road, and really requires a good stomp on the throttle to get up to highway speeds.

This is a capital-T Truck and doesn’t apologize about it. It neither rides nor handles like a car, and the fuel economy isn’t great. Most of the time, you’ll look down at the speedometer to find out you’re driving slower than you think.

Open this photo in gallery The 4Runner is one of few remaining body-on-frame SUVs with a four-wheel-drive gearbox. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

But that's the 4Runner's character, and it's again very likeable and charming. You have to really want the driving experience of a truck to own one of these, but the experience is honest.

Off-road, the 4Runner is nearly unstoppable. Yes, there’s selectable terrain management, but the bones of this truck are what’s important. The 4Runner is one of the few remaining body-on-frame SUVs with a proper low-range four-wheel-drive gearbox. It quite literally jumped through the pubbles and ruts on some lonely forestry service roads, and I wasn’t surprised that the only other vehicle I came across was also a 4Runner.

Technology

Outback

Part of what makes any Subaru a strong contender as a family-friendly offering is the brand’s consistently strong safety ratings. The Outback comes with a camera-based driver-assist system that can help prevent or mitigate collisions, and also includes lane-keeping assist to make long drives less of a chore. It also appears to be more resistant to poor weather conditions than bumper-mounted radar systems.

There's also a very handy front camera that can be used when maneuvering offroad, or just when squeaking into a narrow parking spot.

4Runner

Toyota’s safety systems aren’t quite as complex as Subaru’s assists, but the 4Runner does now come with automated cruise control and forward-collision mitigation. It also has automatic high-beam headlights.

Cargo

Outback

Not only does the Outback have a much faster power tailgate this year, but the Outdoor variant comes with a proper full-size spare wheel. The rear tonneau cover can be retracted with a push, and the hatch opens even when you have your hands full. The swing-away crossbars for the roof rack are a clever solution for carrying larger objects. With the seats up, there’s 920 L of space for gear.

4Runner

Open this photo in gallery A retracting rear window improves the 4Runner's cargo capacity. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

The 4Runner’s rated 255 L of space is a lot less than the Outback, but it’s not quite so cut and dried. For one thing, the Toyota is one of the few vehicles you can get with a retracting rear window, meaning you can stack the trunk right to the brim or hang a pair of mountain bikes out the back. There’s no power liftgate here, which fits the 4Runner’s truck-not-crossover image, but is certainly something owners have been asking for.

The verdict

Outback

Open this photo in gallery The Outback Outdoor XT is as likeable as a labradoodle. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

As a more polished version of a popular car, the Outback is a smash hit. With the possible exception of the too-large touch screen, everything about the big Subaru wagon is as likeable as a labradoodle. It’s got plenty of utility, is flexible for everyday use and doesn’t fall flat when the going gets rough. You probably don’t need any more car than this.

4Runner

Open this photo in gallery The 4Runner Venture remains something of a crude throwback but charming nonetheless. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

But perhaps what you don’t need, you still want. The 4Runner, like the Jeep Wrangler, has more off-road prowess than most owners will ever fully exploit. It’s a bit crude on the road and feels very old-fashioned. It’s something of a throwback and a less sensible choice than the Subaru. And yet it’s charming, really good fun to drive and even makes some practical sense because of its great resale. It’s not the smart choice between the two, but if you grew up playing with Tonka trucks, the good news is that Toyota will still sell you a full-size one.

In 2010, Nissan introduced the Nissan Leaf, the first mass-market all-electric vehicle to hit the road. Since then, more than 475,000 have been sold globally. A decade later, Nissan is now bringing a bigger EV to the market: the Ariya all-electric crossover, which it hopes will represent a new direction for the brand.

“The capitalization of experience on almost half a million cars makes Ariya a big leap forward compared to the Leaf,” said Pierre Loing, global vice-president of product planning for Nissan, ahead of the vehicle’s global online launch.

“When the Leaf came to the market, it was not at the centre. It was treading new ground,” added Giovanny Arroba, Ariya’s senior design director. “We’re grabbing the baton from the Leaf in every way. With the Ariya, we wanted to take it to a new sleek, sexy and seamless interpretation to elevate the brand language to a new height.”

The Ariya is built on an all-new EV platform. Compared to the Nissan Rogue, Ariya is wider (by 59 mm), and shorter in length (by 41 mm) and height (by 58 mm). It’ll be offered in four models: two-wheel and all-wheel drive configurations as well as two different battery sizes, standard (63 kWh) and long-range (87 kWh). Nissan estimates an electric driving range of up to 482 kilometres.

The Ariya seats five. Two horizontal, panoramic display screens take centre stage in the high-tech cabin. Buttons, dials and switches are noticeably absent, replaced with capacitive haptic switches that vibrate when touched and blend seamlessly into the wood trim on the dashboard. A full-colour head-up display projects info directly onto the windshield within the driver’s field of vision.

Open this photo in gallery The centre console 'floats' forward and backward to free up space when necessary. Courtesy of manufacturer

Engineers moved the climate-control system from the cabin to under the hood, where you’d normally find an engine. This allowed designers to create innovative elements such as a “floating” centre console, which slides forward and backward to free up extra space when needed. The small gear shifter is designed to fit snugly into the palm of your hand for a relaxed driving position. It sits on the console and also features haptic drive-mode controls. Tucked under the instrument panel is a centre storage box and fold-out tray meant to replicate a mobile office in the future.

The battery pack sits under the centre of the vehicle. With no driveshaft, there’s a flat, open floor and no awkward and uncomfortable centre hump in the rear seats. Slim contoured front seats give the rear occupants a better view of the front cabin, too.

Open this photo in gallery The Ariya's front grille is dubbed a 'tech shield,' as it protects the sensors that serve the driver-assistance functions. Courtesy of manufacturer

Ariya’s striking exterior represents Nissan’s new design language, according to the company. Thin LED headlamps anchor the front grille, which is dubbed a “tech shield” because it protects vital sensors for the driver-assistance functions. In the centre of the shield is Nissan’s redesigned brand logo, which will appear on all vehicles moving forward. Six two-tone exterior paint combinations, each with a black roof, and three full-body colours are available. Copper is a predominant exterior colour and accent in the cabin. Since copper conducts electricity, it is meant to signal Nissan’s vision of the future.

Connectivity also plays a predominant role. The Ariya features two types of connectivity that work hand-in-hand: Nissan’s personal assistance tech and Amazon Alexa. The personal assistant uses voice-recognition to access a number of features such as the climate, navigation and entertainment systems, by simply saying in natural language, “Hey Nissan, take me home.” Amazon Alexa takes things a step further by connecting your car to your home, so you can perform tasks like turning on the lights or adjusting the A/C before you walk in the house. Over-the-air software updates are also available for the first time ever on a Nissan model. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is standard.

Ariya comes with Nissan’s latest semi-autonomous driving system, called ProPILOT Assist 2.0. The system helps drivers navigate stop-and-go highway traffic, stay centered in their lane and maintain a set vehicle speed and distance to the vehicle ahead. Nissan Safety Shield 360 is also standard. It includes a bundle of six safety features such as intelligent emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind-spot warning and high-beam assist – to name a few.

The truck wars are escalating, but it’s no longer a battle among the Detroit Three. A new crop of pickups are coming, and they’re all electric. Many new automakers are entering the space, vying for a piece of the lucrative pie. Here are six electric trucks on the horizon.

Tesla Cybertruck

One of the most highly anticipated all-electric trucks is Tesla Inc.‘s unconventional Cybertruck. It’ll be available in three versions: a single-motor rear-wheel-drive model (with 402 kilometres of electric range and 3,402 kilograms of towing capacity), a dual-motor all-wheel-drive (with 482 km of range and 4,536 kg towing capacity), and a tri-motor AWD (804 km range, 6,350 kg towing capacity) that can go from zero-to-100 km/h in 2.9 seconds. It’ll have adjustable air suspension with up to 16 inches of ground clearance.

Prices range from US$39,900 to US$69,900. (Add another US$7,000 for the self-driving technology). Canadian prices haven’t been announced yet, but you can reserve one for $150. And the COVID-19 pandemic hasn’t appeared to hamper sales. According to the Cybertruck Owners Club, more than 713,000 Cybertrucks have been preordered since its launch on Nov. 21, 2019.

Production is still on track, beginning in late 2021 for the AWD versions, followed by the RWD in late 2022.

Bollinger B2

One of the most expensive electric trucks comes from a new player, Michigan-based upstart Bollinger Motors LLC. For a newcomer, the all-electric B2 pickup doesn’t come cheap – it’s priced at US$125,000. And it’s pretty barebones, with few safety and convenience features. But it’s functional, with foldable and removable body panels, including the doors, windows and windshield and roof, as well as a “frunk” – front trunk – with 244 litres of space. The bed length extends from 6 feet to 8 feet and 2 inches by removing the rear cab wall and the rear seats, so you can carry up to 16-foot-long cargo in its full-length centre pass-through.

Dual electric motors produce 614 horsepower and 688 lb.-ft. of torque, which will enable it to tow 3,402 kilograms and carry a payload of up to 2,268 kg. Range isn’t the longest – only about 322 kilometres.

Production is set for later this year, founder and CEO Robert Bollinger says. “We are on track at Bollinger Motors. Some of our vendors are delayed, and we are still working with them to get back on track. Some delay may happen, but we’re still hoping it’s minor.”

Rivian R1T

Another new player in the electric vehicle (EV) truck segment is Rivian. The American startup’s truck, designed to be an adventurer’s dream, is called the R1T.

Three battery-pack options are available, with ranges from 370 to 644 kilometres. The fully loaded top model with the largest-capacity battery pack (180 kilowatts) has up to 750 hp and can tow up to 4,990 kilograms. From zero, it’ll hit 100 km/h in three seconds. Inside, it’s luxurious. It seats five passengers, has a trunk in the front, 340 litres of lockable storage to hide valuables, and a flexible crossbar system that expands and collapses so you can mount gear on the roof, the truck bed or the bed floor. For off-roading, it has adjustable air suspension and can wade through water more than 3 feet deep.

Rivian was aiming to be the first EV truck to go to market later this year, but it’s now delayed to 2021. Production will start with the 180 kWh R1T model, followed by the other two trims in late 2022 and early 2023. Prices start at US$69,000.

Arizona startup Nikola Corp. recently unveiled its Badger truck. It’ll be available as either a battery-electric or a hydrogen fuel-cell pickup, designed to go head-to-head against the Ford F-150.

Built for the construction site, the hydrogen fuel-cell truck is expected to have 906 hp and 980 lb.-ft. of torque, a 965-km range, towing capacity of 3,629 kilograms, and a 0-100 km/h time of about 2.9 seconds.

Despite COVID-19 and the recent drop in auto and EV sales in North America, the company is still moving forward quickly; it’s opening up online reservations for its hydrogen-powered Badger on June 29. Prices haven’t been announced yet.

The publicly traded company plans to roll out the battery version in 2021, followed by the fuel cell in 2023. But that may be ambitious, since the company hasn’t even finished building its factory in Coolidge, Ariz.

Here’s a blast from the past – the Hummer. GM is resurrecting the legendary nameplate under its GMC brand. While details are still sketchy, the all-electric pickup is expected to have up to 1,000 hp and 11,500 lb.-ft. of torque, according to GM.

It’ll have an open-air design so you can remove the four roof panels and front T-bar for a convertible-like feel.

It’s expected to launch in late 2021 as a 2022 model and arrive in Canada in the fall of 2022. “GM has been focused on manufacturing efforts to assist in the fight against COVID-19 while also dedicated to maintaining the development of this important product on schedule, with as little impact as possible. We expect little to no delays on development and launch timing,” says GM Canada’s product communications manager, Michelle Burnham.

Prices will be announced closer to the launch date.

Ford F-150 Electric

Ford is going electric with Canada’s best-selling pickup truck, the F-150.

The F-150 Electric pickup will arrive in “mid-2022,” Jim Farley, Ford’s chief operating officer, said in a recent interview on CNBC. There aren’t many details available on the truck yet, but it’s expected to be built in-house and roll off the line with the current gas-powered F-150.

A new F-150, in gas and hybrid versions, is set to debut virtually on June 25, 2020. The electric F-150 will follow within 24 months. Prices will be revealed closer to the launch date.

The price of gas is down, and Dodge wants to make the most of it with three new Hellcat performance vehicles, including a three-row Durango Hellcat SUV.

These are “for the real crazies, who think enough is never enough,” says Tim Kuniskis, FCA’s head of passenger cars for North America. “Dodge now offers three 700-horsepower-plus muscle cars. This really is the golden age of muscle.”

The most powerful is the new Challenger Hellcat Super Stock, which creates 807 hp and, Dodge claims, will cover a quarter-mile in 10.5 seconds at 211 km/h. It uses the existing 6.2-litre V8 Redeye engine but has improved suspension to help it dig in and shave 0.4 seconds from the Redeye’s quarter-mile time.

The Super Stock uses the current widebody chassis setup, but now has 3.09 final-drive gearing on its limited-slip differential, with 18x11-inch wheels and 315-width tires for extra traction. “As cool as burnouts at 50 mph are,” says Kuniskis, “spinning isn’t winning.”

In Track mode, the Super Stock removes all rebound damping from the front suspension while maintaining all steering control, and it activates a revised, full-control suspension adjustment at the rear.

“The front end lifts, creating weight transfer,” says Darryl Smith, Dodge’s director of performance vehicles. “The rear end holds all that weight transfer, those great big drag radials wind up, and you are pushed firmly to the back of your seat in the most aggressive launch in the muscle car business. And that feeling never gets old.”

The Challenger SRT Superstock will be built in Brampton, Ont., and will be available this fall. No price is yet announced, but the current Challenger Hellcat Redeye Widebody has an MSRP of $93,666 – three times the cost of the most basic Challenger SXT, which lists for $32,507.

The four-door Dodge Charger Hellcat is also pumped up for 2021 with a Redeye edition, which will boost the sedan’s output from 717 hp and 650 lb.-ft. of torque to 797 hp. Dodge says this will make it the most powerful and fastest sedan in the world, with a quarter-mile time of 10.6 seconds at 208 km/h. Its top speed is claimed to be 327 km/h.

At full throttle, says Dodge in a press release, “the Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye consumes 5.4 litres/minute of fuel – enough to drain the fuel tank in just under 11 minutes, yet is still rated at 10.7 L/100 km when driven in normal highway conditions.”

The Charger Redeye will be available early next year, and again, no price is yet released. Current Charger Hellcats have an MSRP of $77,699.

Perhaps the rarest of the three new Hellcats, however, will be the Dodge Durango Hellcat SUV. It will only be built for the first six months of 2021, and it will not be continued for 2022 – emissions controls that come into effect for that model year will be too prohibitive. Dodge expects to make fewer than 2,000 of them.

The Durango Hellcat will be powered by a 6.2-litre V8 engine and will generate 710 hp and 645 lbs.-ft. of torque. Dodge says it’s been timed at 11.5 seconds over a quarter-mile track and can cover zero-to-100 km/h in about 3.5 seconds. It also has a towing capability of 8,700 lbs. (3,946 kg), the same as the regular 6.4-litre Hemi V8.

It has a much stiffer and more aerodynamic body, to handle the challenges of driving such a large vehicle at speed. A small rear spoiler adds 140 pounds of downforce at the SUV’s top speed of 290 km/h, while an aggressive front “chin-splitter” beneath the grille reduces front-end lift by preventing air from going under the vehicle.

“When you combine the spoiler with the chin-splitter, you get a 30-per-cent improvement in aerodynamic balance,” says Jamie Standring, Dodge’s chief engineer for performance SUVs. Brakes and suspension are also upgraded, with a 5-per-cent improvement in its roll gradient. “That means the car feels more like it’s on rails,” says Standring.

The Durango’s chief designer is more to-the-point in his description. “From a designer’s perspective, it just looks bad-ass and makes the car look really planted on the road,” says Brian Nielander.

Inside the Durango Hellcat, the controls are focused more toward the driver, and connectivity is handled through FCA’s latest-generation UConnect5 system, which is up to five times faster than before. Engineers took the system home on their iPads and tablets, and their families showed them what passengers really wanted from its controls and displays, other than just acceleration and top speed.

There is no price yet announced for the Durango SRT Hellcat. The current top-end Durango SRT has an MSRP of $68,611, so the Hellcat version can be expected to start at about $85,000.

Audi is hoping an updated version of its best-selling Q5 SUV will tempt buyers back into showrooms – physical or virtual – now that people are buying cars again.

In May, new vehicles sales rebounded after hitting a record low in April, according to market research firm DesRosiers Automotive Consultants.

The Audi Q5 already has sales momentum on its side. Through the first three months of 2020, it was the best-selling compact luxury SUV in Canada – ahead of the Lexus NX and Audi Q3 – according to GoodCarBadCar data. (This time last year, the Q5 ranked second in sales, behind the Mercedes-Benz GLC, for which sales data is missing for 2020.)

Story continues below advertisement

Clearly, the Q5 wasn’t broken and Audi didn’t need to fix it. Nevertheless, it’s getting some significant upgrades for the 2021 model year.

Chief among the updates is a new infotainment system that does away with Audi’s usual rotary-dial controller and replaces it with a new 10.1-inch touchscreen. The brand did the same thing in the revised 2020 A4, and while the screen itself was snappy and responsive, the lack of a physical controller meant taking your eyes off the road more often to look at the screen.

Compared to the number two best-seller, the Lexus NX, Audi’s infotainment system is already miles ahead. The 2020 Mercedes GLC has that brand’s new MBUX infotainment system, which is excellent, and still has physical controls in the form of a highly-intuitive touchpad. (Take notes, Lexus)

Usually when we talk about power in a car it’s horsepower, but increasingly computing power is going to be a differentiator, as is the case here. Audi claims the Q5′s new computing unit has 10 times the power of the previous one. It makes possible things like seamless pinch-to-zoom maps and high-resolution Google Earth images. Live traffic updates are now accurate down to individual lanes too, which should be useful on major highways.

Cloud-based voice control may not sound like a big upgrade, but in our experience the “cloud-based” bit makes all the difference. Similar systems that rely solely on the vehicle’s on-board computing power are often frustrating since they rarely understand what you ask them. In the Q5, if you say, like a barbarian, “I’m hungry,” the Audi will look up restaurants along your current route. Amazon Alexa is also integrated into the car too.

The exterior style has received minor tweaks. It’s still much more conservative, less fussy-looking than the Lexus NX. On the flip side, the Q5 doesn’t really stand out as much among the usual array of small crossovers.

Dany Garand, a Montreal-born senior designer at Audi, said the goal of tweaks to the Q5 were to change how it looked on the road. It does look stronger now in profile, thanks to a lower side-sill graphic that props the car up visually. There are new OLED (organic light emitting diode) rear lights, that run through different animations when you lock or unlock the car. It’s a bit sci-fi and totally unnecessary, but could be useful for showing off to your neighbours.

Story continues below advertisement

A new set of 21-inch wheels adds curb appeal, as does a very on-trend new green paint colour.

The Q5 will be available with a plethora of engine options: two different plug-in hybrids, a four-cylinder and a V-6. The non plug-ins have a new mild-hybrid system that will improve fuel efficiency by a few percentage points. The motors are mated to automatic transmissions: a seven-speed dual-clutch with four-cylinder engines or an eight-speed conventional automatic with V-6 motors. A mildly sporty SQ5 model will arrive as well.

We expect quattro all-wheel drive on all versions, but Audi couldn’t provide details on the specifications or fuel consumption ratings of Canadian models yet.

There won’t be a fully-electric version of this SUV, since the Audi e-tron, e-tron Sportback, and upcoming Q4 e-tron already fill that void.

It’s a safe bet to assume prices will start at or around the $46,300 of the current model. If the price stays at that level, it represents a small premium over the Lexus NX and would be a few thousand dollars less than the Mercedes GLC or BMW X3. The Q5 will face off against other strong rivals, including the Volvo XC60, Acura RDX, Lincoln Corsair and Jaguar F-Pace.

As a group, sales of compact luxury SUVs didn’t drop as severally as most other types of vehicles during the initial months of the pandemic, according to data from DesRosiers. They were hot sellers before COVID-19, and automakers will be looking to popular vehicles like these to jump start sales.

Audi, like most other automakers, introduced online shopping for new and used vehicles through its website, as well as contactless test-drives and handovers.

The new 2021 Audi Q5, including the plug-in hybrid and SQ5, will arrive this fall in Canada.

It’s safe to say most of us won’t be jet-setting to far-away vacation destinations this summer, but don’t despair. There are alternatives for your next family getaway, including renting or buying an RV. It’s a great way to hit the open road and explore Canada’s own backyard.

“It’s going to be the year of the RV. It’s never been quite as popular as it is right now,” says Chris Mahony, president of Go RVing Canada, a non-for-profit industry association that promotes the RV lifestyle.

“It’s a combination of the fact that cross-border travel is gone, people are concerned about safety, and RVing gives you the freedom and flexibility to [vacation] in your own backyard,” he adds.

Story continues below advertisement

There are financial benefits, too, Mahony says. Go RVing estimates that a family of four traveling in an RV can save between 65 and 70 per cent of costs compared with a traditional family vacation to the United States, when factoring in accommodation, flights and restaurant meals.

Similar figures likely apply north of the border. Approximately 2.1 million (or 14 per cent) of Canadian households currently own a RV, he adds.

Whether buying or renting, it can be overwhelming and intimidating to start. There are numerous RVs on the market, but the majority fall under two categories: towable (also known as travel trailers) and motorized. The difference between the two is what you might expect: Travel trailers require a vehicle to tow them, while motorized ones don’t. The latter is a self-contained unit with either a gas or diesel engine. Towable and motorized RVs come in many versions and a range of prices.

Towable options

Open this photo in gallery Tent trailers are affordable and lightweight options. Outdoorsy/Handout

Starting at $10,000, tent trailers are the cheapest RVs you can buy. They’re lightweight, come in many lengths (4.6 to 7 metres) and sleep up to eight people. Some are bare-bones, but you can add options such as hot water, air conditioning, washrooms and kitchen appliances. These trailers can be set up quickly and easily or stored away in a garage when not in use. They can also be towed by most six-cylinder vehicles, including a mid-sized car, SUV or truck – you just have to check your vehicle’s tow limits.

If you want something larger (6.4 to 12.2 metres), fifth-wheel trailers are the way to go. They’re towed by a pickup truck using a special fifth-wheel hitch attachment. They’re spacious with high ceilings and slide-outs that extend the RV wall with the touch of a button, to expand the living space. They can sleep up to eight people and have showers and kitchens. They’re also detachable, so you can leave your trailer at the park and take your vehicle to explore the local surroundings. Prices range from $35,000 to $160,000.

Motorized options

When it comes to motorized RVs, there are three types: Class A, Class B and Class C. The largest, Class A, are luxurious and high-end with all the comforts of home. Some can cost as much as $1-million. Many have multiple TVs, several bathrooms and bedrooms, high-end kitchens with real-wood cabinets, marble countertops, stainless steel appliances, and central heating and air conditioning. Class A motorhomes are built on a specially designed chassis that can range from 6.4 to 12.2 metres, so they require more skill and caution when driving. A small vehicle, boat or golf cart can be towed behind the RV, so you can take quick trips in your car while your motorhome is parked.

Class B vehicles, also known as camper or conversion vans, are similar to a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van. Ideal for up to four people, they’re easy to drive and park because they fit into a regular parking space. They’re good on fuel, too. Prices start at $70,000.

Open this photo in gallery The best-known motorized RV is the truck-like Class C. Outdoorsy/Handout

The most iconic motorized RV is the Class C. With its truck-like profile, it sleeps up to eight with unique hideaway beds over the cab and kitchen tables that transform into sleeping accommodations with a few simple steps. They have kitchens, dining areas and bathrooms. Prices range from $60,000 to $200,000.

Do your research

Choosing the right RV to rent or buy depends on your family’s needs, says Mahony at Go RVing Canada. “Are you going out on the open road every single weekend? Are you going south of the border in winter? If so, a motorized [RV] might be handy.”

However, if you have an SUV or a pickup truck, you might want to consider a travel trailer, which offers more RV for less money. Roughly 70 per cent of buyers choose that option, Mahony says.

If you’re buying an RV, he advises you to figure out what you can afford, understand your family’s needs and work with a reputable dealer because you’ll have a continuing relationship with them for service, storage and maintenance. Make sure you understand the details of ownership – including warranty, maintenance, storage, insurance and usage – before you buy. The Recreational Vehicle Dealers Association of Canada is a good place to start to find a certified dealer, he says.

If you’re thinking of renting, he says to do your research and calculate the extra fees for campgrounds, fuel and insurance. Insurance may cost extra or be rolled into the rental price. Typically, an average 7.5-metre Class C vehicle, the most popular motorhome to rent, costs $1,500-$2,000 a week, he says, and comes fully equipped with dishes, glasses, pots, pans, towels and bedding. Travel trailers usually cost $500-$800 a week. Don’t forget to ask what the rental price includes and whether there are any mileage restrictions or additional charges, he advises. Most RV rentals require a standard class-G driver’s licence unless the vehicle has air brakes, and all drivers must be at least 21 years old.

Lastly, Mahoney says, take advantage of valuable online resources to map out your vacation route. The Parks Canada website is a good place to start. It could spur a new appreciation of the country we call home.

The next generation of North America’s best-selling vehicle offers a dizzying array of innovations that raises the stakes in the Detroit Three’s relentless war for light-duty truck domination.

Want choice? Fasten your seat belts.

Among the dozens of optional choices on the 2021 Ford F-150, consumers will be offered: a hybrid power train with 5,400 kilograms of continuous hauling power, front seats that fold flat for naps, and/or an on-board integrated electrical power source strong enough to drive multiple power tools.

In this, the 14th generation of the all-American full-sized pickup truck, Ford has foregone revolutionary change in favour of adding features and refinements that aim to meet challenges from GM’s Sierra and Silverado, and FCA’s Ram.

The 2021 F-150 does not have a singular radical change on the scale of the weight-saving all-aluminum body introduced in 2015. Instead, the new truck, which retains its aluminum body, has a broad range of innovations that: make the vehicle more convenient and comfortable on the inside, improve driver safety, and increase productive workspace for contractors.

Or should I say new “trucks?” The F-150 comes in dozens of variables stacked onto its traditional body-on-frame platform. There are 11 different front grilles, six engine choices, 13 wheel choices ranging from 17 to 22 inches, three cab configurations – even three headlamp configurations! – all spread over six trim levels that range from the XL work truck version to the luxurious Limited.

On the exterior, the changes are largely cosmetic and relatively minor. The front grilles are identifiably F-150 macho but have been rounded for a softer look, not unlike the grille found on the Ram 1500. The headlamps are surrounded by C-shaped LED running light halos that bear a passing resemblance to the GMC Sierra. The tailgate offers optional pockets to accommodate c-clamps (for holding materials in place), more tie-down points, and little pockets to hold tablets, cups and pens.

Kick-switch operated power running boards on upgraded models were extended to make it easier to reach into the cargo box.

Ehab Kaoud, chief designer for Ford’s North American trucks, said the wheels have been pushed out two centimetres to provide a more aggressive stance. Yet, the vehicle’s aerodynamics have been improved by three per cent through, among other things, active front grille shutters that close at speed and a front air dam that deploys at speeds above 64 km/h.

The headlamps range from standard halogen reflectors to LED reflectors and, in premium models, “dynamic bending” LED lights that point in the direction the vehicle is turning.

Story continues below advertisement

The interior, meanwhile, has plusher, upgraded materials on premium models. Ford has introduced an optional fold-down shift lever, creating a large flat work surface on the centre console to handle laptops and clipboards. Dawn Piechocki, F-150 engineering manager, said one-third of current owners use laptops in the cabs, and yet prefer a traditional shift-lever over space-saving dash-mounted gear controls. Storage space enhancements include a flat storage area in the back seat with foldable storage boxes.

For stolen naps on those too-long days, the F-150 also has available front seats that recline nearly a full 180 degrees.

Another play to contractors (or, far that matter, tailgate partiers) is the available on-board electrical power inverter, with capacities that range from 2.0 kW to 7.2 kW, depending on model. The battery-driven electrical inverter, which is recharged by the truck’s engine as needed, eliminates the need to carry a standalone unit to run power tools.

The SYNC4 infotainment technology has a 20-centimetre touchscreen as standard, but the XLT lux and above models will have a 30-centimetre screen, oriented horizontally. This fourth-generation system offers voice-activated controls, customizable screen, wireless Android Auto and Apple Car Play connections, and both on-screen and traditional control buttons.

Although the 3.3-litre gasoline V6 is the base engine, Ford retains the 2.7- and 3.5-litre Ecoboost (i.e., turbocharged) engines. Kaoub says Ecoboost engines are account for 60 per cent of F-150s sold. The beefier 5.0-litre V8 now has cylinder deactivation, which cuts fuel consumption under light loads.

Craig Schmatz, F-150 chief engineer, notes the 3.5-litre Ecoboost hybrid is the first full hybrid light duty pickup on the market. Though it uses electricity stored in a smallish 1.5 kW/hr lithium battery to save fuel, he said the vehicle can pull its rated 5,400-kilogram load “as long as you need” drawing on the gasoline engine as needed. Ford estimates the hybrid can travel as far as 1,100 kilometres on a tank of gas.

Among the 10 new driver-assist features, one of the most intriguing is the hands-free option. Higher end models come with the hardware that will enable the trucks to be driven hands-free on more than 160,000 kilometres of divided highways in Canada in the U.S. The system won’t be operational right away; Ford says it can be activated for an additional fee when the software is released in the summer of 2021.

When an automaker seeks to keep a best-selling vehicle at the top of the heap, there is tendency to avoid risky changes. The caution is understandable, given the fact that the F-series has been Canada’s top selling truck for 54 years and, around the world, Ford’s truck franchise is valued at more than $50 billion. That is why Ford is keeping a familiar look, while enriching the new F-150 with an array of technology and features.

“It is radical? No,” said Kaoub. “We do vehicles that satisfy our core customer group.”

It’s also playing to American patriotism, with little U.S. flags embossed on the sides of the front dash. One model even comes with an applique map of Ford’s home city of Detroit. Ford emphasizes the trucks are “100 per cent assembled in America,” at plants in Dearborn, Mich., and Kansas City, Mo.

With safety concerns related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Ford did not provide journalists any hands-on experience with the new F-150. Deliveries to Canadian dealerships are expected in November.

A Buick pickup truck? Unlikely. But even without going that far, Buick is now basically a truck company. Last year, its three SUV nameplates accounted for more than 90 per cent of its sales in Canada. And by far the best-selling of them all was the tiny, almost toy-like Encore.

Since SUVs are working for Buick, it’s no surprise the brand is expanding its market coverage. After all, there’s a wide space between the compact Envision and the full-size, three-row Enclave that would be filled nicely by, say, a two-row mid-sizer (anybody remember the 2004-2007 Rainier?).

Instead, the 2020 newcomer is another subcompact. So is the Encore GX a replacement for the no-suffix Encore? Apparently not. We’re told the GX’s role is to plug the gap between the Encore and the Envision. However, the GX doesn’t exactly “split” the difference – it’s actually much closer in size (4.35 metres long) to the existing Encore (4.28) than to the Envision (4.67).

On paper, the GX’s 1.2- and 1.3-litre turbo three-cylinder engines look like a downgrade from the 1.4-litre turbo four-cylinder of the original Encore. The new triples are, however, state of the art; even the 1.2′s 137 horsepower is only one down on the older 1.4, and its 162 lb.-ft. of torque beats it by 14 lb.-ft. Respective outputs for the 1.3 as tested are 155 hp and 174 lb.-ft. Fuel-consumption numbers are not class-leading but better than average.

In Canada, the GX is offered in three trims. The smaller engine comes only in the base Preferred trim, with a continuously-variable automatic transmission (CVT) and front-wheel drive, starting at $26,098; all-wheel drive (with a driver-selectable FWD mode) is paired with the 1.3 engine and a nine-speed automatic and starts at $28,098. Select and Essence grades start from $30,098 and $32,598 respectively.

Buick no longer aspires to purvey “motorcars” that are “distinctive, substantial, powerful and mature,” but Quiet Tuning is still one of its signature traits. So, how does that work out with a mighty-midget three-cylinder under the hood? Somewhat. The engine doesn’t obviously present like it’s “missing” a cylinder, and it’s never disagreeable. But neither is its sound signature anything like premium when working through the gears.

On the highway, it settles down nicely into the relaxed, long-legged stride of a much bigger vehicle. But don’t expect an old-style big-Buick pillowy ride. In the GX, involved drivers will enjoy quick, light-and-lively steering and relatively taut, responsive cornering, but the ride is stiff.

Open this photo in gallery The all-black interior can be swapped for beige or, on the Essence trim, caramel colours. Jeremy Sinek/The Globe and Mail

As for the cabin environment, the test sample’s all-black interior didn’t strike us as overtly premium, despite faux-carbon-fibre accents and some real white stitching. I suspect it works better with the alternative beige or (on the Essence trim) caramel interior colours – a level of décor choice rare in this corner of the market.

Despite Buick’s entry-premium aspirations, the Encore GX is priced much closer to mainstream subcompact crossovers than to premium European ones. That said, some plebe alternatives start for thousands less with manual transmission, while like-priced rivals may include more standard features.

With the possible exception of its laid-back highway cruising, there is no single aspect of the Encore GX that stands out from its peers, but solid ability across a broad range of attributes adds up to an appealing package overall. Just be careful that all the options don’t lure you into paying $40,000 (before taxes) for a fully loaded one. That may not be a lot of money for a Buick, but it’s a lot for a subcompact SUV.

Looks

Raked screens and large, well-attired 18-inch wheels help the Buick look less boxy or dorky than most of the competition. To our eyes, it also looks bigger than it is.

Interior

Open this photo in gallery Most functions can still be controlled with manual buttons and dials. Jeremy Sinek/The Globe and Mail

The 94.3 cubic-foot passenger volume is average for a segment that ranges between 88 and 100. Your average adult can sit behind your average driver without crowding, though smaller people may wish the rear bench was higher for a better view out. The driving position is also rather low, despite a standard 10-way power seat. Exterior sightlines could be better, ditto the readability of the analog gauges on a bright day (the digital speedometer in the centre 4.2-inch display is a welcome alternative). The integrated centre-stack touch screen is an 8-incher on all trims and, happily, most everyday adjustments can still be done with real buttons.

Performance

Over several hundred kilometres of freeway cruising, we admired how easily the little engine handled the long-legged top gear, showing 2,200 rpm at 120 km/h and only rarely needing to downshift. Then we realized it was topping out in eighth gear. To access ninth (1,800 rpm at 120), we had to upshift manually, and often, even that didn’t work. A shorter axle ratio would make ninth more usable while trimming the 10.3-second saunter from 0- to 100-km/h. Subjectively, the GX feels quicker than that. It launches very linearly, with no perceptible turbo lag, and in cut-and-thrust traffic, the transmission seamlessly picks the right gear at the right time. We averaged 7.9 L/100 km over a week of mostly highway driving with the A/C on.

Technology

Open this photo in gallery Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and SiriusXM satellite radio come standard. Jeremy Sinek/The Globe and Mail

Standard safety tech includes forward-collision alert, automatic emergency and front-pedestrian braking and lane-keep assist. On the infotainment side, 4G LTE Wi-Fi capability, SiriusXM, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard. The Select trim adds lane-change and blind-spot alerts, but adaptive cruise (standard on a $28,000 Hyundai Kona), navigation, automatic parking assist, head-up display and wireless charging require extra-cost packages.

Cargo

Open this photo in gallery The seatbacks fold nearly flat, improving the usability of the cargo space. Jeremy Sinek/The Globe and Mail

Cargo volumes are a little above average, and usability is enhanced by seatbacks that fold very nearly flat; a bi-level cargo deck that lies flush with the folded seats when up; and a fold-flat front passenger seat. A hands-free power liftgate is standard on the upper two trims and the GX can tow 1,000 lbs.

The verdict

Stylish, functional and fun to drive. Base pricing is reasonable, but watch those options!

The last time I drove a Grand Cherokee, its legendary off-road talents were undiminished. Back on pavement, however, I knew I was driving a design past its prime – a pleasant and comfortable SUV gently easing into mellow old age.

None of this matters in the case of the Trackhawk. This uber-Jeep is simply deranged. Its unique ingredient is so outrageous, so over-the-top manic and surreal, that normal parameters for evaluating a mid-size SUV become irrelevant. It is what it is. If its outstanding attribute speaks your language, you may never want to drive anything else. If not, go buy a Lexus RX hybrid.

The Trackhawk is the product of surgically implanting the insane supercharged V8 from a Dodge Challenger/Charger Hellcat into a Grand Cherokee SRT (as if the SRT’s 6.4 litres and 485 horsepower wasn’t enough). In its new home, the 6.2-litre Hellcat motor makes the same 707 hp as in the original Hellcats (the latter was amplified to 717 in 2019) and 645 lb.-ft. of torque (down 11 on the cars).

The Trackhawk possesses the aerodynamic properties of a brick outhouse and weighs a whopping 400 kilograms or so more than the cars, so don’t expect it to match their claimed 200-mph-plus top speeds; you may have to make do with a mere 180-mph velocity to Con College. But the Jeep does have one advantage on its hellraiser siblings: all-wheel drive. That not only makes it theoretically a four-season daily driver; it also parlays the Jeep’s weight into no-muss, no-fuss launch traction that other Hellcat drivers can only dream about.

There is a launch-control function, but the conventional torque-converter automatic doesn’t quite deliver the literally gut-wrenching step-function departure of rival uber-SUVs with automated-manual transmissions that literally “dump” the clutch. But if that costs the Jeep a tick or two in track testing, it makes it up in the real world. Boosted by a supercharger instead of most others’ turbochargers, there is simply no lag; stomp on the loud pedal and the Trackhawk explodes off the line with an instant-on immediacy that largely makes the launch-control redundant. According to Car and Driver tests, most rival uber-SUVs trail the Jeep from 0-100 km/h even using launch control; driving “normally” on the street, the Jeep’s advantage will only widen.

You want numbers? Jeep claims 0-60 mph (0-97 km/h) in a pulverizing 3.5 seconds. That computes with our measured 3.7-second runs to 100 km/h (according to the Jeep’s Performance Pages) or 3.9 seconds as independently reported by our own test equipment. Whichever way you slice it, this thing is devastatingly fast.

Here’s a different kind of number: 21.9 L/100 km. Over a COVID-curtailed week of driving (i.e., no long highway trips) and making frequent use of the right pedal, that’s what the trip showed. The Trackhawk’s 17.7 L/100 km official combined fuel consumption earns it a $3,000 federal gas-guzzler tax. Its carbon dioxide and smog ratings are both 1 out of 10.

Open this photo in gallery You'll want to keep an eye on the gas gauge when driving the Trailhawk. Jeremy Sinek/The Globe and Mail

Back to the drive, Jeep has masterfully tuned the exhaust system to make huge noise – a savage, crackling, multi-textured shrieking bellow – when you want it. And yet it leaves you in relative peace when you – or your passengers, or anyone else within a one-kilometre radius – don’t want it. When you’re just pottering, an amiable rumble is layered with random whines from the blower and the (otherwise-seamless) transmission; settle into cruise on the highway, and the tailpipe music fades into the background.

As for handling, the extensive chassis upgrades have effectively tamed the Trackhawk’s combination of weight, height and velocity, but they don’t disguise it. This isn’t one of those SUVs that shrinks around you and drives small. On the track you might marvel how well it dances for an elephant – but you still know it is an elephant.

Considerable lean builds up through long cloverleafs, and although the steering is light and precise, it’s too numb to communicate the imminence of run-wide understeer. No doubt in Track mode, which channels 70 per cent of torque to the rear, you could power the rear into a drift even on dry pavement, but you’d need to work at it – and need a safe, private place to do so.

At $113,745, the Trackhawk seems like silly money for a Jeep, until you realize that alternatives of comparable performance (all of them European) are even pricier. The next least expensive, the BMW X5 M Competition, starts at almost $130,000.

The Trackhawk may not match the all-round sophistication of the Europeans, but a Jeep badge has its own cachet, and the sound and fury of that engine will never get old. But on the subject of old, this generation of the Grand Cherokee is due for replacement real soon. Chances are there won’t be a Trackhawk version for a while, if ever, so if this unique brand of dementedness turns your crank, grab one while you can.

If you keep a vehicle in the family in Ontario, you don't have to pay the sales tax – but only if that vehicle was a gift.

If money is exchanged, you have to pay a 13-per-cent retail sales tax (RST).

Story continues below advertisement

“A specified vehicle may be transferred exempt from RST to a person from a member of his or her family provided no consideration was given in respect of the vehicle,” says the Ministry of Finance website.

Normally, if you're buying a car in Ontario from a private seller, whether it's from within Ontario or from any other province, you have to pay a provincial sales tax on vehicles.

It’s the buyer, not the seller who pays the tax. It’s paid to Service Ontario when you transfer ownership.

There are a few exceptions, including if you are left a vehicle after a death or if you get it as a gift from an immediate family member. That includes spouses, children, siblings, parents, in-laws, grandparents and great grandparents. It won’t work for cousins, uncles or aunts.

Family value?

If it is a family gift, both members have to sign a sworn statement saying that no money was exchanged.

Would taking over a loan count as exchanging money? Probably, but Ontario’s Ministry of Finance didn’t answer the question and said it can’t comment on individual situations.

""All situations have different variables, and for that reason, I will have to direct you back to the bulletin which clearly sets out the tax rules with regards to motor vehicles,"" an Ontario Finance spokesman said in an e-mail.

Story continues below advertisement

While rules vary between provinces, most others don't require taxes on gifts between family members. But some, including Quebec and Nova Scotia, only allow the exemption if both the giver and receiver live in the province.

In Nova Scotia, taking over a loan means that it's not a gift.

""In order for the transfer to be exempt from sales tax, the item being gifted would have to be free and clear of any loans [or] debt,"" Krista Higdon, a Nova Scotia government spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. ""Taking over a loan on a vehicle is not a gift transaction as the outstanding loan amount is the declared purchase price.""

A gift that keeps on taking?

The tax is based on whichever is greater – the sales price or the Canadian Red Book wholesale value. For instance, if the tax was based on a $20,000 loan, it would be $2,600.

If it was based on the wholesale value?

Canadian Red Book says the wholesale value of a 2015 Toyota RAV4 XLE with 60,000 kilometres of mileage would be $12,900, which seems low. So that would mean $1,677 in sales tax.

Story continues below advertisement

If you're bringing a vehicle into Ontario from another province, you also need a Safety Standards Certificate from an authorized garage. The cost is usually under $100, plus the cost of any required repairs.

Also, make sure that the bank will allow the loan to be transferred.

""This in itself may be an issue,"" said Warren N. Barnard, executive director of the Used Car Dealers Association of Ontario, in an e-mail.

It might be easier if you take out a fresh loan or put the vehicle on your line of credit, adds Viraf Baliwalla of the Automall Network, a Toronto-based car broker.

“This would be a cleaner transaction,” Baliwalla says.

In a luxury landscape now overrun with SUVs, it would appear that the drivers who still choose to drive cars are still in it for the actual driving experience.

That certainly seemed to be Lexus’s thinking when it reworked its IS compact luxury sports sedan (read: BMW 3 Series rival) for 2021. Its presentation of the update – which had its public unveiling on Facebook at 7 p.m. today – is dominated by an emphasis on driving dynamics.

“Agility and athleticism expand pure driving performance,” says the press-release headline. Or, as chief engineer Naoki Kobayashi terms it, “what we had foremost in mind in developing the new IS was to make it a car that excelled in communicating with the driver regardless of the road conditions or driving situation.”

Story continues below advertisement

Not only does the new IS itself promise a more engaging, tactile driving experience, it also marks the debut of Lexus Driving Signature, which means the same driving traits will eventually be common to the whole Lexus lineup. Contributing to that goal will be a new 5.3-kilometre test course in Shimoyama, Japan, that was inspired by the famed Nurburgring race track in Germany.

Getting down to specifics, the new IS is not a ground-up redesign but rather a subtle reskin and painstaking refresh of the existing architecture. The wheelbase is unchanged, overall dimensions grow only minimally, and the shape is clearly an evolution of the outgoing Gen-3 model, which dates back to 2014.

Open this photo in gallery The upcoming IS is a painstaking refresh of the existing car's architecture. Courtesy of manufacturer

Also basically unchanged is the model lineup offered in Canada: the IS 300 rear-wheel drive (RWD) powered by a 241-horsepower 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine; the IS 300 all-wheel-drive (AWD) with a 260-hp, 3.5-litre V6 under the hood; and the IS 350 AWD with a brawnier 311-hp version of the 3.5-litre V6. Transmissions remain eight-speed on the RWD and (disappointingly) still only six-speed on the AWD pair. Americans can also have the IS 350 as a rear-driver with the eight-speed autobox, but that combo, theoretically the sportiest, is not offered here.

A lot of detailed chassis fettling, including structural stiffening, new suspension geometry, reduced unsprung weight (for example a switch from steel to aluminum control arms), and an increase to 18-inch wheels/tires should elevate baseline handling across the board. Beyond that, the F Sport option ups the wheels to staggered-size 19-inchers with seriously aggressive 265/35R19 rubber at the rear. Going even further, a Dynamic Handling Package adds adaptive variable damping and lightweight forged-aluminum wheels.

The F Sport package also includes a cool-air intake with sound generator, a unique exhaust and, of course, the obligatory go-faster cosmetic touches.

If Lexus does the chassis-work right, not only will it actively please engaged drivers, but even disinterested drivers should like the way the car feels, even if they don’t know why.

And everybody should get something out of the other enhancements for 2021: An easier-to-reach 8- or 10.3-inch touch-screen display; an enhanced 17-speaker/1,800-watt Mark Levinson audio option; standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto; and an enhanced suite of standard safety technologies under the LSS+ 2.5 umbrella.

In the latter category, the pre-collision system (which includes forward-collision warning and automatic emergency braking) adds longer-range pedestrian and cyclist detection and improved recognition of oncoming vehicles when making a left turn; emergency steering assist has been added; the dynamic-radar cruise control can now automatically increase vehicle speed for overtaking a slower vehicle; and the lane-tracing (lane-centering) assist feature has improved recognition of lane markers and the edge of the road.

The 2021 model is due in showrooms late fall this year. Pricing has not yet been announced but is unlikely to vary much from the current MSRPs, which start at $41,250.

Prior to my recent purchase of a 2019 Mini Cooper S Countryman ALL4, both my vehicles had been painted a simple, classic black. I liked the understated, time-honoured look. There are those who believe that black is the only appropriate colour for a car. One reason is that black cars look good in every kind of weather and even, as Canadian superstar singer Gino Vannelli observed, “better in the shade.”

A lot of drivers feel the same way; over fifty per cent of the cars on the road are shades of grey and black.

So when I decided to turn in my 2010 Dodge Grand Caravan, I chose to go with something sporty. I wanted a car that looked playful and a little off the wall. I considered many hues: British Racing Green, Chili Red and Chestnut Brown. Ultimately, I went with Island Blue Metallic. I also added a white top and white racing stripes. My new ride would be fun to drive and fun to see.

It didn’t take long for me to realize that it was, indeed, a very notable vehicle. So notable in fact, that I had become “that guy.” As in, “that guy in the tropical-blue striped Mini.” (It is possible that instead of “guy,” people use more descriptive language to identify me.)

When you drive a unique-looking car, it quickly becomes clear that you have kissed off any semblance of anonymity. Occasionally, I’ll see another Island Blue Metallic 2019 Mini Cooper S Countryman ALL4 with white racing stripes – but not often.

The experience has shown me that anonymity, or at least the sense of anonymity that automobiles create, is the foundation on which most poor driving is anchored. When you lose your anonymity, you must take responsibility for your actions.

When you drive an easily identifiable vehicle, road rage is out of the question. For me, that hasn’t been an issue. I’m not a yeller. Credit the advice of my late uncle Tom Jamieson, who once explained, as he navigated Bayview Avenue and was cut off by a sedan, “If you get angry every time some other guy does something stupid on the road, you’ll lose your mind.” In my old black minivan, I could have gotten away with screaming the occasional anatomy lesson at a fellow motorist. In my tropical blue Mini, I will be remembered. It would be embarrassing, and perhaps a little dangerous, to roll around engaging in road rage, only to be called out in the parking lot of some grocery store by the irate objects of my ire.

In the same way that I am resented for driving transgressions, I am appreciated for driving favours. When possible, I accommodate other drivers. If someone needs to nose into the lane and I can facilitate, I will. Driving my Mini has increased this predilection. If I’m called out in the parking lot of our local grocery store, it’s going to be a friendly wave.

If we are searching for easy, low-tech ways to improve driving habits, we may want to consider incentives for those who opt to make their cars more personal. Why not give a cash rebate to the driver who willingly paints his or her first name on their vehicle? After all, you are much more likely to be a courteous driver if you have “Jennifer” written in bold letters across the side of your Honda Civic.

Why won’t dealerships provide discounts for unique exteriors? In 2016, Dodge offered the psychedelic “Go Mango” hue for its 2016 Dodge Challenger and Dodge Charger SRT models. Why not bring that back on all models? Why not Lantana Purple, Hakone Green, Indy Yellow Pearl? What about a discount on insurance for anyone who is willing to have a digital reproduction of their face printed on the hood of their Ford Fusion?

Of course, if everyone gets weird, then being dull will stand out.

What’s the point of painting your Mini Island Blue Metallic with white stripes or your Challenger “Go Mango” if everyone is doing it?

That’s the moment I will opt for something in midnight black. Some of us like to stand out.

The director, playwright and actor Mani Soleymanlou will succeed Brigitte Haentjens as the artistic director of the National Arts Centre French Theatre. He will take over from Haentjens on Aug. 31, 2021, at the conclusion of her nine-year term.

His appointment comes at an unprecedented time, with theatres across the country dark because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of what was programmed in the NAC French Theatre’s fall season has either been cancelled, rescheduled or reoriented into digital offerings.

“Theatre was one of the first things cancelled, and it’s likely going to be one of the last to come back,” Soleymanlou, 38, told The Globe and Mail. “It was a shocker for me, but all of a sudden we have this luxury of time to rethink theatre, in terms of what the audience needs and who the audience is.”

A 2008 graduate of the National Theatre School of Canada and currently based in Montreal, Soleymanlou has also lived in Tehran, Paris and Toronto. He is best known as the artistic director of the Montreal company Orange Noyée, which he founded in 2011.

Soleymanlou’s connection to the NAC French Theatre stretches back to 2017, when he directed Le Wild West Show de Gabriel Dumont, a romp about a multilingual buffalo-hunting commander of the Métis forces in the North-West Resistance of 1885. After opening in Ottawa, the NAC production, written by 10 playwrights with various languages and backgrounds, toured to Montreal, Winnipeg, Quebec City and Saskatoon.

Haentjens will program the French Theatre’s 2021-22 season, to be presented after her departure.

Before assuming his new position next summer, Soleymanlou intends to give thought to the role of theatre in society. “The theatre is one of the only places where we can sit together, think together and stay quiet together,” he says. “I understand the health aspect of closing theatres now, but it’s important to get it back. Not only that, we need to rethink how to make it essential.”

Nearly two decades after the slaying of Run-DMC star Jam Master Jay, federal prosecutors said Monday they have solved one of New York City’s most enduring mysteries, charging two men from his neighbourhood with murder and suggesting that the hip-hop artist – celebrated for his anti-drug stance – was ambushed over a cocaine deal.

The suspects were identified in court papers as Ronald Washington, 56, who is currently serving a federal prison sentence stemming from a string of robberies while on the run from police after Jay’s 2002 death, and Karl Jordan Jr., 36, who is also charged with engaging in a cocaine distribution conspiracy in 2017.

Jason “Jay” Mizell, known professionally as Jam Master Jay, formed Run-DMC with Joseph “Run” Simmons and Darryl “DMC” McDaniel in the early 1980s. Together, they helped take hip-hop mainstream with hits like “It’s Tricky” and the Aerosmith remake collaboration “Walk This Way.”

Jay’s death, following the long unsolved slayings of rappers Tupac Shakur in Las Vegas in 1996 and Christopher “Biggie Smalls” Wallace in Los Angeles in 1997, shook the hip-hop world. Chuck D of Public Enemy compared his death to that of John Lennon. More than $60,000 in rewards was offered, but witnesses refused to come forward and the case languished.

Rapper Jam Master Jay, one of the founding members of Run-DMC, was murdered in 2002 'in cold blood' as part of a dispute over a drug deal, prosecutors say. Reuters

“This is a case about a murder that for nearly two decades had gone unanswered,” Acting U.S. Attorney Seth DuCharme said at a news conference announcing the charges. “Today, we begin to answer that question of who killed Jason Mizell, and why, and we’re confident that we can prove those charges beyond a reasonable doubt.”

Washington, who had reportedly been living on a couch at Jay’s home in the days before the killing, was publicly named as a possible suspect or witness as far back as 2007. Prosecutors allege he waved a handgun and ordered another person at the recording studio to lie on the ground while Jordan shot Jay in the head Oct. 30, 2002.

According to prosecutors, Jay would bring in bulk amounts of cocaine to sell retail and was killed as retribution for cutting Washington out of a plan to distribute 10 kilograms in Maryland.

“They walked in and murdered him in cold blood,” DuCharme said.

A message seeking comment was left with a publicist for Run-DMC. The group performed anti-drug concerts, established scholarships and held voter registration drives at its live shows. In Hollis, the Queens neighbourhood where he grew up, Jay was seen as a role model. Friends were puzzled by his death, thinking him an unlikely target for violence.

If convicted, Washington and Jordan each face a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum of life in prison, or the death penalty. Prosecutors said in court papers that Attorney General William Barr had not yet decided whether to seek the death penalty.

Jordan pleaded not guilty at an arraigned held Monday by teleconference because of coronavirus-related precautions. His lawyer declined to comment. Washington, who is imprisoned in Kentucky, will be arraigned later this week, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors have asked that both be jailed pending trial.

The 37-year-old Jay was shot once in the head with a .40-calibre bullet by a masked assailant at his studio in Hollis. Police identified at least four people in the studio with Jay when he was killed, including the two armed gunmen.

At Jay’s funeral, McDaniels remembered his friend and fellow Run-DMC star as “the embodiment of hip-hop.” He was also a husband and a father of three children.

“Jam Master Jay was not a thug,” McDaniels said. “Jam Master Jay was not a gangster. Jam Master Jay was a unique individual.”

Prosecutors, though, now say Jay had been bringing cocaine into the New York area since 1996.

Story continues below advertisement

At the time, Jay’s acquaintance with Washington – a repeat offender with convictions dating in 1982 – worried and upset his family.

Before ending up on Jay’s couch, Washington served prison time for grand larceny, assault, criminal use of a firearm, heroin possession and other charges. He was been linked to the 1995 fatal shooting of Randy Walker, a close associate of the late Tupac Shakur.

Afterward, prosecutors said, Washington hopped from motel-to-motel and robbed businesses including supermarkets and a Burger King while detectives pursued him in connection with Jay’s killing. He remained at large for nearly three months until police on Long Island nabbed him for robbing a motel.

Last month, as prosecutors were preparing to seek a grand jury indictment against him for Jay’s death, Washington filed a handwritten petition asking to immediately be released to home confinement, arguing his medical history put him at risk for complications from coronavirus. Federal prosecutors responded by asking for more time to respond, delaying any decision until after Washington was charged.

Jordan, just a teenager when Jay was killed, was declared a juvenile delinquent after a 1999 robbery arrest and had a firearm case dismissed when the complaining witness refused to co-operate with law enforcement. In recent years, prosecutors said, he’s been caught on audio and video surveillance six times selling cocaine to an undercover federal agent.

Canadian actor and singer Brent Carver inhabited many roles with a masterful presence that could, at times, appear otherworldly. Between 1980 and 2017, he appeared in 20 productions at Ontario’s prestigious Stratford Festival, where he interpreted iconic characters like Hamlet and made them his own. Both at home and internationally he consistently wowed audiences and critics.

In 1979 he played Ariel to Anthony Hopkins’s Prospero, directed by John Hirsch in Los Angeles. It was noteworthy but it didn’t shoot Mr. Carver’s star into the U.S. stratosphere. That would happen more than a decade later when his portrayal of Luis Molina in Kiss of the Spider Woman made him the toast of Broadway. In the musical, Molina, a gay Argentine window-dresser, eases the pain of his mostly heterosexual Marxist cellmate by re-enacting scenes from favourite movies. Mr. Carver sings at the beginning of the show, followed by a scene in which he emotes as Molina.

During previews, singer Barbra Streisand was overheard whispering to her companion, “Geez! He can act as well!”

New York audiences were astounded by the virtuosity of this Canadian “newcomer.” The New York Times noted that the American press greeted Mr. Carver’s arrival with the amazement reserved for someone found miraculously singing and dancing under a cabbage leaf. Its powerful theatre critic Frank Rich, not one to dispense praise lightly, described the 41-year-old Mr. Carver’s performance as “riveting.” It won him the coveted 1993 Tony award for lead actor in a musical.

It was remarkable that he was able to perform at all. A recent personal trauma had left an indelible mark that would haunt him the rest of his life. In December, 1991, a fire of unknown origin broke out at his house in Stratford. At the time an adored friend, actor Susan Wright, was staying at the home along with her parents. All three perished in the blaze. At his acceptance speech for the Tony, Mr. Carver thanked “my dear, dear Susan. This is for you. And I can say: ‘Death be not proud.‘”

Mr. Carver left Kiss of the Spider Woman three months after that. His contract was up but he explained, in an interview, that he found himself unable to play any role for too long. The energy he devoted to characters, frequently anguished ones, was debilitating. One regular theatregoer who saw Mr. Carver performing as Pontius Pilate in Jesus Christ Superstar at Stratford said, “He acted everyone else off the stage. I thought, the poor man. Does he have anything left over for himself?”

Few entered Mr. Carver’s private world but those who did remarked on his gentility and kindness. He once admitted that “emotional guardedness” caused him some regret as it had distanced him from love. He also explained his reluctance to divulge personal details. “I always felt that if I said anything it would just be a label they put on me. I also felt it was nobody’s business. As Hamlet says, ‘You would pluck out the heart of my mystery.’”

Aside from Molina and Hamlet, Mr. Carver cited Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof, and Robert Ross in Timothy Findley’s The Wars as being some of his favourite roles. The Wars was adapted into a TV movie. He also appeared in the films Shadow Dancing (1988), a thriller with Christopher Plummer; Millennium (1989), a sci-fi drama with Kris Kristofferson; and the made-for-TV movie The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, in which he played the lead character, Ichabod Crane.

While comfortable in front of a camera, the stage was where Mr. Carver drew raves. “No one ever delivered the Seven Ages of Man [speech] from As You Like It with as exquisite a melancholy as Mr. Carver did under the direction of Des McAnuff,” wrote Globe and Mail theatre critic J. Kelly Nestruck. A former artistic director at Stratford, Mr. McAnuff also had high praise for Mr. Carver. “His work was at once sensitive and dangerous. He was a shy rock star.”

An animal lover and vegetarian, Mr. Carver dressed conservatively, preferring to remain inconspicuous in public. “He never set store in being famous,” said Janice Thomson, a long-time friend from Niagara-on-the-Lake, where Mr. Carver maintained a home for many years. “He truly believed he was just doing work like anyone else. He used to talk to me about understanding the audience, people who’d made a journey to get to the theatre. He said everyone came with different moods and expectations. He wanted to meet those expectations to the best of his ability. I never saw him wanting to be Brent Carver, the star,” Ms. Thomson said.

Another friend and neighbour from Niagara-on-the-Lake dropped by Mr. Carver’s house one day to tease him about a clue encountered in a crossword puzzle: Canada’s most prestigious actor, 11 letters down. The actor’s boyish face broke into a delighted grin. “That’s me,” he said. He then asked if he could have the crossword when it was done so he could show it to his mother.

After winning Canada’s 2014 Governor-General’s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Achievement, a recognition that thrilled him, Mr. Carver was the subject of a short National Film Board production titled simply Brent Carver. Accompanied by a solo cellist, within the melancholy setting of a rusting, paint-peeled warehouse, Mr. Carver’s wiry figure steps with slow, feline precision from shadows toward a single light. The song he’s about to sing is All Through the Night, a 1700s Welsh ballad that connects Mr. Carver to his Celtic family roots. In voice-over, before his ethereal tenor fills the air, and before he embarks upon a soliloquy from Hamlet, and before his blue eyes overflow with tears, he reveals a rare personal sliver of himself. “What I do is perform. In many ways it’s like a sensation of coming home. It’s the sensation of moving through all sorts of thresholds to find the heartbeat of what’s going on.”

The Carver household, overseen by Kenneth Carver, a lumber truck driver, and his wife, Lois (née Wills), was a working-class family of eight children who lived in Cranbrook, a small city in southeastern British Columbia. One of the children, a boy named Danny, drowned at age 2 when he fell into a water-filled ditch while Lois had her back turned. Brent Christopher Carver, born on Nov. 17, 1951, was a baby when the tragedy occurred. He said he learned to sing before he could talk. The first song he ever learned was Danny Boy, forever a reminder of the brother he never knew.

Patriarch Kenneth Carver played guitar and sang for fun but no one else in the family, other than Brent, had an interest in show business. “They’re all sane,” Mr. Carver once quipped. He graduated from Cranbrook’s Mount Baker Secondary School in 1969. For the valedictory address of his graduating class, he sang a Broadway show tune. Eager to get on with things, he dropped out of the University of British Columbia, where he had been studying theatre, and hit the road. The stage was set for his stellar career to begin.

In the 70s, Mr. Carver moved to Toronto where he shared a house with comedian Martin Short and his wife. Almost 15 years later they would compete for the same Tony, which Mr. Carver won.

He would return to Broadway three more times: in 1998′s Parade as Leo Frank, a doomed factory manager, for which he received a second Tony nomination, as Edgar in King Lear (2004) and in Romeo and Juliet as Friar Laurence (2014).

One award Mr. Carver received during the early 1980s was a Dora Mavor Moore Award for his portrayal of a gay man in Martin Sherman’s play Bent. The play revolves around the persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany.

After his success in Kiss of the Spider Woman, the Los Angeles Times asked how his family reacted to him playing a gay character. “They were very moved by the show,” he replied. “They’re quite understanding. Even when they saw me in a pretty wild production of Tartuffe. It was set in the West and in one scene, I had to wear a pair of backless leather chaps with nothing on underneath. After that, they came backstage and said, ‘Yes, dear, that was fun.’ ""

Home, whether actual or metaphorical, painful or pleasurable, was never far from Mr. Carver’s thoughts. Despondent over the inability to work due to COVID-19, he recently returned to his birthplace, a place he called “the most beautiful on Earth.” He once told The New York Times: “It constantly calls me back, the pine smell, the lakes, the trees, the mountains. It’s a tough place to make a living but it’s a great place to live.”

He died in Cranbrook on Aug. 4, at age 68. His family did not disclose the cause of his death. He leaves his sisters Vicki and Frankie, and brothers Randy and Shawn.

To honour the life and ferocious talent of Mr. Carver, Mirvish Productions dimmed the marquee lights of two theatres in Toronto on Aug. 7 – the Royal Alexandra, where he performed a solo show of his stories and songs in 1995; and the Princess of Wales, where he starred as Gandalf in the world premiere production of The Lord of the Rings in 2006."

Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds has responded to a plea from British Columbia Premier John Horgan for help with messaging to younger residents about partying during a pandemic.

Mr. Reynolds posted a video to Twitter, framed as a phone call to Mr. Horgan, saying youths shouldn’t look to him for medical advice, unless it was related to plastic surgery.

But he warned younger B.C. residents of the dangers posed by COVID-19, saying many young people are getting sick and dying.

He says it’s also dangerous for the most vulnerable in B.C., home to some of the coolest people on Earth, including David Suzuki and his own mother.

Mr. Horgan had called on Mr. Reynolds and fellow actor Seth Rogen for help in crafting messages for younger residents, who the Provincial Health Officer says make up a disproportionate amount of the current COVID-19 cases.

Dr. Bonnie Henry said Thursday that people between the ages of 20 and 29 now make up the group seeing the largest increase of infections.

Health Minister Adrian Dix has also called on those planning on playing host to large events this weekend to expect a visit from bylaw officers to ensure the 50-person limits are being followed.

Because a new drug gives its user a random superpower but only for five minutes, the people who take it tend to check their wristwatches. Watching the dull sci-fi, quasi-superhero film Project Power, I found myself doing the same. One supposes the movie can be seen as a cautionary tale about Big Pharma. We should worry more about Big Film.

Project Power, from Netflix, gives itself away well within five minutes. The bad guy (he’s the one with the villainous goatee) is handing out the new drug to the punk pushers for free. One of the pushers (Newt, played by the rapper Machine Gun Kelly) says the deal sounds too good to be true. “That’s because it is,” says The Goatee.

The drug is bad, you see? Power is bad. It’s very simple. And so is Project Power. It’s too good to be true. It’s not worth the risk. Take two hydroxychloroquine and call me in the morning.

Open this photo in gallery Jamie Foxx as Art, a former soldier done wrong by his government, in Project Power. Courtesy of Netflix

Jamie Foxx stars as a former soldier done wrong by his government. He’s stoic, on a mission to find the source of the drug called power. It would be great if he occasionally lightened up and said a funny thing or two for, you know, entertainment’s sake. He doesn’t, though. He’s all business. Why hire the talented Foxx for a leading role, only to instruct him to turn off the charisma?

Then we have the good cop fighting the system, played by Bruce Willis. Hold on, it’s not Willis after all – it’s Joseph Gordon-Levitt, playing a ragged, Willis-y unshaven police detective. I didn’t recognize Gordon-Levitt with a gun in his hand. He’s not built for this kind of maverick cop role. Maybe the scriptwriter knows it, because there’s a running joke about the character being a Clint Eastwood/Dirty Harry wannabe.

The third co-star is Dominique Fishback, who is perfectly suited to play a precocious teenager who, though smart, struggles with her grade point average. Though a rapping savant, she suffers from stage fright. That’s her untapped superpower, if you will: hip hop. She deals drugs, but only because her mother has diabetes, needs an operation and is without health insurance.

“I gotta work the system,” the girl says. But, as she’s told, “You’re young, black and a woman. The system was designed to swallow you whole.”

This is unfair. This is power inequity. This is America.

New Orleans, specifically, perhaps chosen because of its recent history of being abandoned by its country in the wake of Hurricane Katrina of 2005. In Project Power, the city’s inhabitants are basically guinea pigs used to test the new super drug, which, we learn, is so strong as to enable one man to take out a whole police battalion by himself. Fighting the system, then.

Most of the film’s action happens at night, so we really don’t get a good look at the colourful city. Why hire New Orleans as a location if you’re not going to show it off?

That’s probably a question for Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, the horror-thriller director duo who previously shouted “action” on Catfish, Viral and Nerve, not to mention Paranormal Activity 3 and Paranormal Activity 4. For Project Power, they cast a moody, gritty and ominous mood. It’s their thing.

There’s plenty of shooting and explosions and weird super-powering. Being a human fireball seems cool, but impractical. (I like the rubbery guy, but even when the henchmen are popping superpower pills they’re not very good at henching.) But the action is mostly run of the mill. It’s a comic book that fails to come to life.

The villain touts the drug as part of the evolution of the human species – something to level the playing field, or, if you like, to destroy it entirely. There’s some meaning to the film, about power systems. But it comes wrapped in a gloomy package that makes the whole thing, well, a tough pill to swallow.

Project Power is available to stream on Netflix starting Aug. 14.

A long-stalled addition to the Château Laurier is closer to being built following an agreement between the historic hotel’s owners and a heritage group that fought initial plans.

Heritage Ottawa says a new design for the addition would preserve a picturesque view of the landmark’s rear courtyard and better mesh with the adjacent Rideau Canal.

The group is also applauding the use of Indiana limestone cladding and copper and bronze elements that reflect defining elements of the early 20th-century structure near Parliament Hill.

Original plans for the addition were widely panned by critics, variously described as resembling a giant air conditioner, shipping container or radiator tacked on to the regal building.

Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson tweeted he was pleased to see the parties had worked collaboratively and agreed on a new design.

John Lehmann/The Globe and Mail

The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled against the main complainant in an ongoing dispute involving Steven Galloway, a bestselling novelist and former head of the creative writing program at the University of British Columbia.

Mr. Galloway is suing the woman, a former student who has accused him of sexual assault and harassment, for defamation.

On Thursday, the country’s highest court rejected the woman’s application to appeal a lower court’s ruling that she must turn over documents Mr. Galloway’s lawyers have requested and which have been deemed relevant to the case.

It is a key legal win for Mr. Galloway, whose lawyers have been seeking the documents for more than a year.

David Wotherspoon, one of the lawyers for the woman, known in court documents as A.B., called the ruling disappointing.

The application for leave to appeal was dismissed without costs. No reason was given for the judgment. There is no further legal recourse in the matter.

Mr. Galloway is suing the woman, whose identity is sealed under court order, and more than 20 other people, including UBC faculty and other Canadian authors.

Thursday’s judgment means she will be compelled to produce documents such as e-mail correspondence with some of the other people named in Mr. Galloway’s lawsuit.

The allegations against Mr. Galloway, initially blanketed in secrecy, received a great deal of attention and led to his dismissal from the university and the devastation of his personal life, according to his lawsuit.

A.B. is trying to have the lawsuit thrown out under anti-SLAPP legislation, which seeks to protect freedom of expression on matters of public interest and ensure that powerful people or organizations cannot silence critics.

Story continues below advertisement

When A.B. testified in a B.C. court in 2019 that she could not remember certain things, she was asked by Mr. Galloway’s lawyers to produce documents they said could have cleared up those matters. When she refused, she was ordered by a judge to produce the documents. That judgment was upheld by the B.C. Court of Appeal in April. She then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.

“While it is unusual for the [Supreme Court of Canada] to grant leave in such cases, given the importance of the issues for survivors of sexual violence, we felt it was important to seek leave,” Mr. Wotherspoon noted in an e-mail to The Globe and Mail.

“An appeal would have been an opportunity for the [Supreme Court] to ensure that the anti-SLAPP protections are in fact real for survivors faced with actually litigating these applications. That issue is now left for another day and another case.”

The case dates back to November, 2015, when UBC announced that Mr. Galloway had been suspended because of “serious allegations.” An independent investigation conducted by retired B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Ellen Boyd concluded on a balance of probabilities that Mr. Galloway had not committed sexual assault, but found that he had had an inappropriate affair with A.B.

In June, 2016, Mr. Galloway was fired by UBC for an “irreparable breach of … trust.”

The university was later ordered to pay him more than $240,000 in damages after it was found UBC had damaged his reputation and violated his privacy rights.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Galloway filed his lawsuit in October, 2018, arguing that he was defamed by false accusations of rape, sexual assault and physical assault and that the defamatory statements were recklessly repeated both within the university and online, including on social media.

A GoFundMe campaign has raised more than $87,000 to help pay legal costs for the people named in the suit.

The trial for Mr. Galloway’s defamation suit had originally been scheduled to begin in June, but it cannot happen until the SLAPP matter is resolved. Mr. Wotherspoon said he hopes that can move forward quickly.

Lawyers for Mr. Galloway declined to comment for this story.

Vancouver set and costume designer Drew Facey is a fixture of the local theatre community, designing shows here and beyond for theatre and opera productions, winning 18 Jessie Richardson Theatre Awards along the way. Now Facey is leaving Vancouver – and theatre. COVID-19 has claimed another professional casualty.

“In one week in March I lost 14 months’ worth of contracts,” Facey says in his nearly empty East Vancouver condominium, the one he and his partner decided to sell after the pandemic hit (his partner works in hospitality, which has also been hard hit).

“I obviously went through a difficult, dark time emotionally,” Facey continues. “I focused singularly for the last 15 years on building this design practice, and it was wiped out in a week. And there was really no kind of sense that companies were going to be supporting artists and that we would be able to survive this.”

Seeing the writing on the wall, Facey, 39, spent the past few months retraining in 3-D visualization, while collecting the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. He spent hours each day teaching himself the sometimes frustrating technology. On Thursday, Facey takes off for Merida, Mexico, where he and his partner will open an interior design business in the Yucatan state capital using the complicated digital technology.

His departure is a huge loss for the theatre scene, and a scary sign of what may be to come.

Because of COVID-19, performing arts companies have cancelled their upcoming seasons – and the contracts that came with them. There is no indication of when it will be safe – or legal – to gather in theatres again.

“The theatre industry is so fragile and freelance theatre artists are so vulnerable,” says Facey, who is beloved as much for his positive energy as his creativity. “I worry constantly for my colleagues in such uncertain times and I feel that the conversation hasn’t really begun around what’s next for all of us.”

Facey was born and raised in Kelowna, B.C., where he obtained a subscription to Architectural Digest when he was 10. He studied at Concordia University in Montreal and in Vancouver, at Emily Carr University of Art and Design and Langara College’s Studio 58 theatre school. He has worked for a long list of companies, designing nearly 170 professional productions, ranging from The Sound of Music to Shakespearean tragedies to an opera based on Shane Koyczan’s novel-in-verse Stickboy.

When the nominations were released for the 2014 Jessie Awards, for instance, Facey had a jaw-dropping seven of them, and walked away with the award for Significant Artistic Achievement for his body of work, among others. Most recently, he won the Jessie in June for outstanding set design (large theatre) for Cost of Living at The Arts Club Theatre Company.

“He is a great positive spirit, a mass of talent and he’s got a marvellous optimistic encouraging way about him,” says Christopher Gaze, the long-time artistic director at Vancouver’s Bard on the Beach. “So when you talk to him, you just feel that almost anything is possible and won’t it be fun to do it.”

It’s a lot to walk away from, but Facey is not feeling much optimism about theatre’s immediate future.

COVID-19 further highlighted the issues that were already making him uncomfortable about how the industry operates. He felt his life wasn’t sustainable – working on overlapping shows, travelling several months of the year, all to support life in an expensive city like Vancouver.

He made a decision to stop working in what he calls dysfunctional situations, or for companies where he has witnessed bullying and racism – he declines to give details – and then felt more centred; he could sleep again. Then the pandemic hit.

“A lot of theatre companies are keeping vague promises of work on the horizon and I think that it is giving artists false hope that their jobs are going to return soon,” Facey notes. “But when I talk with [artistic directors] about what the future holds, any that I have spoken with are very worried about how limited programming and opportunities are going to be when and if theatres reopen.”

He is also frustrated with the pandemic divide between freelance artists like himself, and some people employed in senior positions by theatre companies. “They’re working, they’re collecting their salaries, they’re going to work every day. And then on the other side of it, you have the actors and choreographers and directors and designers and everybody else, and we’re all out of work,” says Facey. “That is frustrating. And knowing that that doesn’t seem like it’s going to change any time soon is difficult.”

We were speaking a few days before his departure, and Facey pulled out his laptop to demonstrate his new line of work. He scrolled through a series of photos of a derelict property in Merida; then new photos, re-imagining digitally what the home could look like. This kind of 3-D visualization can help a real estate agent sell a property; then maybe Facey will get an interior design gig from whoever buys the place.

“I feel like I grieved this career that I spent 15 years building and sort of went through this quite dark process and then made a decision that I had to just be strong and build out. I built a design business once; I can do it again,” he says.

He is clearly excited about the work. But his departure leaves a chasm – that likely won’t be unique.

“It’s a sad testament of this pandemic that people will be changing gears; they’ll be finding other ways to earn livings. And maybe they won’t come back to the theatre,” says Gaze, who worries about losing all that experience and depth. “It’s dangerous. And there could be many losses over the next while.”

In the 1976 live album and concert film The Song Remains the Same, Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant sings a line from Stairway to Heaven, “and the forests will echo with laughter.” After a pause, he asks rhetorically, “Does anybody remember laughter?”

It’s a good question. Here’s a better one: Does anybody remember live albums?

There was a time when concert LPs were a big deal. Frampton Comes Alive! and Cheap Trick at Budokan, for example, were massive sellers in the 1970s and defining albums of those acts’ careers. Nirvana’s MTV Unplugged in New York is a stone-cold classic. James Brown’s Live at the Apollo is legendary.

With YouTube, though, live performances available to fans are ubiquitous. Live albums are now mostly released as catalogue filler or contractual obligations. Any prestige that concert recordings once had is gone. And, given current live-music restrictions caused by COVID-19, concert albums are not only relics but probably represent an act of insurrection.

All of which makes Vancouver hard-rock duo Japandroids seem out of step with a new live album recorded at the storied Toronto venue Massey Hall in 2017. “We’re an old-fashioned band in a lot of ways,” says drummer David Prowse, who shares singing duties with guitarist Brian King. “We approach things differently from a lot of our contemporaries.”

Prowse lists Nirvana’s Unplugged recording and Neil Young’s Live at Massey Hall among his favourite live albums, but reserves special praise for Otis Redding’s Live in Europe. “It’s an artist at the height of his powers, in the best circumstances possible,” says Prowse, born 16 years after the album was recorded. “It’s an amazing moment of communion with an audience.”

Communion with an audience – does anybody, in these coronavirus times, remember that?

In celebration of live music and live albums, Prowse picked four classic concert LPs he’d never listened to before and gave them a spin. What follows are his first impressions of those albums.

Open this photo in gallery Bill Withers, Live at Carnegie Hall Handout

Bill Withers’ Live at Carnegie Hall, from 1973, recorded on a rainy night at the iconic venue in 1972, a year after his breakthrough hit Ain’t No Sunshine: “The only parallel I can think of between Japandroids and Bill Withers is us playing Massey Hall and him playing Carnegie Hall. They’re not venues you’d expect a lot of audience engagement to happen. So, it was really cool to hear this funky show. You can hear clapping, and I can imagine people jumping out of their seats and dancing. The juxtaposition is great – a sweaty-dancey show in a button-down venue.”

Joni Mitchell’s Miles of Aisles, from 1974, recorded at the peak of her fame at various California venues: “I could be wrong, but it seemed like Joni was giving the audience a little bit of what they wanted and a little bit of what she wanted. She’s interested in exploring this jazzier side of things. But then she goes back to the singer-songwriter stuff the crowd may have bought their tickets for.”

Boogie Down Productions’ Live Hardcore Worldwide, from 1991, by the hip-hop pioneers, recorded in Paris, London and New York: “I was familiar with them, but never took a super deep dive into their music. This album blew me away. The audience engagement was incredible. The beats in my car sounded like they were going to blow out my speakers. But there’s a great balance, with the booming bass and then KRS-One has such a great voice and he’s an amazing lyricist. I feel like, what have I been doing with my life? Why did it take me so long to hear this album? It just left me so energized.”

Bob Marley and the Wailers’ Live!, from 1975, recorded at London’s Lyceum Theatre: “I feel that this album is a reminder of what a great songwriter Bob Marley is. His messages about oppression are very relevant right now. White people are comfortable with Bob Marley as long as he’s the happy reggae guy who sings One Love. But there’s a huge underestimation of what a powerful voice he was.”"

The ballet says it still intends to proceed with its winter season in March 2021 and its summer season in June 2021 at the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts in Toronto.

Artistic director Karen Kain says she’s “particularly heartbroken to have to cancel ‘The Nutcracker.’”

Kain notes this will be the first year since 1955 that Toronto audiences will not be able to watch the holiday classic that’s set in a winter wonderland and features celebrity cameos.

“The glorious production includes 213 dancers, musicians and children and requires many hours of rehearsals that would need to start in September,” Kain said Wednesday in a statement.

“I am very pleased, however, that we will open the revised season with Crystal Pite’s ‘Angels’ Atlas.’ I could not think of a more fitting ballet for our return than Crystal’s profoundly moving work about human connection and the ephemerality of existence.”

Kain said “Angels’ Atlas” will be performed with George Balanchine’s“Serenade” and James Kudelka’s “The Four Seasons.”

The winter season will continue with James’ “Cinderella” and John Neumeier’s “A Streetcar Named Desire.”

Canadian actor Michael Greyeyes says he’s been waiting decades for a project like Rutherford Falls.

The Peacock streaming service announced this week that Greyeyes is among the cast members in the upcoming series, which touts the largest Indigenous writing staff for an American TV show.

Ed Helms, Sierra Teller Ornelas and Mike Schur created the comedy, about a small town in upstate New York that borders a reserve.

Story continues below advertisement

Helms plays the town namesake, Nathan Rutherford, who fights the moving of a historical statue.

The Toronto-based Greyeyes plays the chief executive of his tribe’s mid-level casino.

The Plains Cree performer says he booked the project in early March, but the pandemic put a halt on things until recently.

“I read the scripts and I was just really blown away, gobsmacked at how smart they were,” Greyeyes said this week in a phone interview.

“It took me a while to get through every script because I just kept laughing. As I said to Sierra, sometimes I was crying for joy, because it’s a kind of representation that I’ve been waiting 30 years to come out of Hollywood.”

Peacock hasn’t announced a premiere date for Rutherford Falls yet, but Greyeyes said he plans to do a table read in Toronto via video conference soon and then fly to Los Angeles to shoot.

Other cast members include Jana Schmieding as Nathan’s long-time friend, and Canadian actor Dustin Milligan of Schitt’s Creek fame as a reporter/podcaster in the town.

Greyeyes said the series felt “groundbreaking,” partly because it deals with Indigenous identities outside of the trauma that’s a part of their history.

“This is really new territory,” Greyeyes said from Halifax, where he’s set to shoot the film Wildhood by writer-director Bretten Hannam.

“We haven’t seen families portrayed in this way.”

Greyeyes said he was thrilled when Teller Ornelas, who is Navajo and Mexican-American, said the writers’ room would be half Indigenous.

“When diversity enters into a writers’ room, the door is literally pried open and there’s easier access,” said Greyeyes, who is also a choreographer, director, educator and founder of the non-profit Signal Theatre in Toronto.

“This is what I think is at the crux of these sort of social movements, is access. It’s not that we’ve been unable or incapable of making shows like this. It was a question of opportunity.

The director of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts was dismissed by the board over a hiring dispute, not because of complaints of a toxic workplace, says the director of a U.S. gallery who has close ties with the Montreal institution.

Alex Nyerges, director of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, says he was given that reasoning in a recent conversation with Michel de la Chenelière, the chair of the MMFA’s board of trustees. Nyerges has worked with de la Chenelière at the French American Museum Exchange organization, and he collaborated with the recently dismissed director, Nathalie Bondil, on exhibitions over the past decade.

“Michel felt [the board] had the absolute authority, regardless, and they were going to put their person in that role,” Nyerges said in an interview.

The dismissal of Bondil last month as director-general and chief curator of one of Canada’s largest art galleries has sparked a fierce debate about the acceptable bounds of workplace behaviour and the degree to which boards of trustees should step into the inner workings of cultural institutions. The Quebec government has commissioned an investigation into the circumstances of Bondil’s dismissal, given the museum’s prominence in the province’s culture.

Montreal Museum of Fine Arts employees release letter supporting dismissal of former director Nathalie Bondil

A central issue of the debate has been the reasons for her dismissal: whether it is, as the board has publicly said, in response to employees who complained that she had created a toxic work environment, or, as Ms. Bondil and her defenders say, because she objected to the board hiring a person for a senior role at the museum without her consent.

A spokesperson for the MMFA said de la Chenelière would not comment on the conversation with Nyerges.

On the board’s side, more than 100 current and former employees of the Montreal museum signed a letter on Monday in support of the decision to dismiss Bondil, saying she had fostered an unhealthy work environment and claimed credit for her subordinates’ ideas.

Richard Gagnier, head of the museum’s restoration department, said the employees signed and issued the letter because they believe that public debate over Bondil’s dismissal is getting derailed by the hiring issue, when those inside the museum feel it was all about intolerable working conditions. For example, Gagnier said his department was regularly consulted too late in an exhibition planning process to properly do its job of restoring and maintaining art objects. He said repeated requests for postmortems on exhibitions to avoid future problems proved fruitless.

“This is a cri de coeur from employees,” he said. “It’s coming from the base.” He added that the signatories had consulted neither their union nor the museum’s board before releasing the letter.

But Nyerges said that, any workplace issues aside, the board’s main hiring job was picking a director – and that anyone more junior than that should be the director’s choice. He said that the board of trustees should have acquiesced to Bondil’s choice for the newly created position of a director of the curatorial division.

“I can tell you, I would quit before I was forced into a situation like that,” he said, adding that it “goes against the grain” of how a museum should operate.

Nyerges said the dispute over hiring was the central reason he was given for the dismissal, and the issue of workplace tensions was presented to him as “tangential.”

The board’s original explanation for the dismissal on July 13 cited employee complaints that began the previous October, and which led to a report from an independent human-resources firm that described the workplace of the museum as “toxic.” As a result of the report, the board decided to divide Bondil’s job in two, with her keeping the role of director-general and someone else leading the curatorial team. In a previous interview with The Globe and Mail, Bondil said she accepted the change, but disagreed with the board’s choice of curator Mary-Dailey Desmarais for the promotion. She said she respected Desmarais, but had wanted someone with more experience for the job.

Nyerges said that, in a decade of working with Bondil, he had seen her “transform that museum from being a relatively unknown, smaller, less-relevant institution into being a powerhouse in North America.”

He said he is speaking out because he sees a trend of the leaders of cultural institutions being turfed by their boards for what he called “capricious” reasons. He said he is on a weekly call with the directors of the 15 largest art museums in North America, and his colleagues have not wanted to come to Bondil’s defence.

“More [directors] are reluctant and hesitant to be vocal,” he said. “I’m just not one of them.”

He said he welcomed the report of the Quebec government and hoped it would clear the air."

Orville Peck was at the Grammy telecast earlier this year when a woman yelled his name during a commercial break. Peck turned around to see none other than Shania Twain coming his way. The country music icon got to Peck’s seat, hoisted him in her arms and hugged him. She’s a fan – not nearly the only one.

Peck stands out in the country music crowd. The crooner, with a moody baritone, substantial indie-music cred and a storyteller’s stone-lonesome heart, is mysterious, gay and never appears in public without his trademark tassled masks. Nowadays everyone and their dog is wearing a mask, but nobody pulls it off with the panache of the Canadian balladeer now based in Los Angeles.

Following up on the out-of-nowhere success of his 2019 debut album, Pony, Peck releases a new EP on Friday, which comes with a duet with his heroine/admirer Twain. The album is ironically called Show Pony, a term used to describe a person who appears to perform well, but has no actual ability. By phone, Peck spoke to The Globe and Mail about persons, personas and the twain they meet, and the Twain he met.

Orville Peck, what’s your deal?

I’m a country and western artist who likes to sing songs about myself with the sincerity that is required in the genre and in a way that is perceived as new and different and that maybe challenges the status quo.

And what about the fancy masks you wear? Do you wear them to remove yourself from the equation, so as to let the songs stand on their own?

That’s one of the byproducts, for sure. It’s not the main intention though. What I love about country music is that it is very much at the crossroads of sincerity and performance. I think that’s a beautiful space to create art in. You can be as bold and dramatic and theatrical as you want, but you get away with it because all of it is steeped in sincerity. I like to work from that place.

But with the performative aspects, don’t you risk people questioning your sincerity?

I’ve gotten questions like that. But at the end of the day it isn’t my job to answer that for people. I spend all my effort trying to make art that I think I would enjoy and that I can feel proud of, because it’s from a genuine place. I can’t also worry whether other people see that or not. That’s a battle you’re probably going to lose at some point.

Any other intentions with your look?

I like things that are not just spoon-fed to me. I grew up loving artists like David Bowie and Freddie Mercury and Elton John. These are prolific artists who created profound lyrics and songs, but also looked like they were from outer space. You can do both those things.

Clearly one person who doesn’t question your sincerity is Shania Twain, who you duet with on Legends Never Die on your new EP Show Pony. How did that come together?

I’d heard that she was a fan of mine. My first reaction was that I didn’t think that was possible. Maybe because I’m a bit of a cynic. But if she even knew I existed, I had the inspiration to write a song written off what I thought was a rumour that she liked me. So, I wrote it and sent it off to her management.

Shania must get a dozen of such requests a day, though.

Right. We went back and forth on it with her management for awhile, and it felt like it wouldn’t be possible. But then I met her at the Grammys and she told me how much she loved me and how much she loved my last album and my voice and how much she loved the song I wrote for her. Two months or so later, we were sitting at her ranch in Las Vegas riding her horses and working on the song together. She was actually the last person I hung out with before the quarantine started.

So many collaborations are done remotely. It’s quite something that you got to do it in person.

Story continues below advertisement

I’m such a fan of collaborations. I love that Shania and I got to have what I felt like was a very thrilling, adventurous road to this song. It felt very much in keeping with the spirit of the collaborations that are so rich in the history of country music.

Valerian Mazataud/The Globe and Mail

A group of more than 100 current and former employees of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts has released a letter supporting the dismissal of former director Nathalie Bondil, alleging she created chaos within the workplace and took credit for subordinates’ ideas.

The letter, issued late Monday, backed the decision of the board of trustees, who ousted Ms. Bondil last month after a third-party firm hired by the board alleged she had created a toxic work environment. Ms. Bondil and her allies, however, say the dismissal stemmed from a disagreement over who to hire for a senior role at the museum.

Since then, the dismissal of the well-connected museum director has become a serious debate in Canada’s visual arts world, with major donors, governance experts and international art leaders weighing in on whether the board made the right call. The Quebec government has even hired its own independent firm to investigate the circumstances.

Story continues below advertisement

Anne Grace, curator of modern art at the MMFA and one of the organizers of the letter, said it wasn’t easy for staff members to speak publicly. But, she said, the debate has become so heated it has made it difficult for them to do their jobs.

“We have wanted to be discreet, we have wanted to take the high road through all of this controversy,” Ms. Grace said in an interview. “But at a certain point we wanted to rectify a lot of misinformation.”

Ms. Bondil’s supporters point to her track record of doubling the gallery’s floor space and tripling its attendance since she took over in 2007. She won national and international recognition, including an investment in the Order of Canada in 2016.

When reports began to surface in the Quebec press last month about issues with Ms. Bondil’s management, provincial Culture Minister Nathalie Roy declared: “The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts is Nathalie Bondil!”

But behind the scenes, staff say in the letter, conditions had deteriorated in recent years. The letter says Ms. Bondil largely rejected her staff’s ideas, and took credit for those she did accept. The letter also said incidents of harassment and intimidation were “daily occurrences.”

Ms. Grace said that many staff members took offence to Ms. Roy’s characterization. “An institution is more than just a person who has the high-profile position of director,” she said.

The letter did not provide specific examples of the allegations. Ms. Grace said the group wanted to protect each other’s privacy and that, as far as she knew, those who had shared their experiences with the independent human resources firm were bound by confidentiality agreements.

Story continues below advertisement

Ms. Bondil did not immediately respond Monday to a request for comment on the letter. In a previous interview with The Globe and Mail, she said that difficulties arose at the museum during a stressful period leading up to the much-delayed 2019 launch of the One World galleries, a suite devoted to non-Western art and archeological objects.

One staffer was driving installers too hard, she said. When the museum’s board hired an outside consultant to report on working conditions, she said she agreed to its recommendations, including working to improve relations with a “problem employee.”

Ms. Bondil held the titles of director and chief curator, which is unusual for comparable art galleries. Ms. Bondil said she was stretched too thinly at the rapidly expanding museum and heartily agreed with the board’s decision to hire a new curatorial director to share the load. That idea came from the outside consultant the board had hired to look into workplace issues.

Ms. Bondil said her dismissal was the result of a disagreement with the board over who to hire as the lead curator. Ms. Bondil said she disagreed with the board’s choice of Mary-Dailey Desmarais for the job because she wanted someone with more experience in the senior role, although she said Ms. Desmarais was a capable curator.

Ms. Grace said Ms. Desmarais was supported by her colleagues at the museum, who signed a public letter last month welcoming her appointment. Ms. Desmarais, who is part of the wealthy Quebec family that is prominent in corporate and cultural circles in the province, was first hired by the museum in a junior role in 2014.

“Yes, she’s a Desmarais,” Ms. Grace said, “but for us she’s a very well-educated, well-respected colleague who we felt was very capable to take on her position.”

The Canadian Museum for Human Rights, embroiled in controversy over allegations of a racist, toxic workplace, has named a new president and chief executive officer.

Human rights lawyer Isha Khan, former executive director and senior counsel for the Manitoba Human Rights Commission, will begin in the position next week. Khan, 46, has no museum experience, but has worked for years as an advocate for human rights, working with organizational change and workplace culture. Most recently, she was appointed by the Minister of Public Safety to co-ordinate a review of conditions in federal penitentiaries.

She joins the museum at a difficult time. An independent report released last week found that racism is “pervasive and systemic” within the federal museum. The third-party investigation was ordered after public allegations of racism, censorship (suppressing the museum’s LGBTQ content), and inaction on the part of management in dealing with allegations of sexual harassment.

“I think that dismantling systemic racism, discrimination, oppression has to be very deliberate and thoughtful work,” Khan said in an interview on Monday, shortly after Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault announced her appointment. The announcement indicated she will take “decisive action for change” and ensure the museum is diverse and welcoming for all employees.

In the interview, Khan said discrimination, abuse and harassment will not be tolerated. “I’m going to work with the staff to bring about some change within the walls and build the trust of the community around us.”

Khan was born and raised in Winnipeg, where she earned her undergraduate degree before studying law at the University of Victoria. She has lived and worked in Calgary, and has been back in Winnipeg since 2007. She is the board chair of the United Way of Greater Winnipeg and a founder of the Canadian Council of Muslim Women’s Winnipeg chapter. Her family is of Pakistani origin.

“It’s 2020, and it’s still pretty unfortunate that it’s remarkable that there is a woman of colour in a leadership position like this, that that’s something that we talk about,” Khan said. “But that said, I’m a realist, and I think my appointment does break down some barriers, and if I can be part of that, if I can be part of modelling what a representative work force should look like or having diversity in leadership positions, I’m pretty happy about that. I feel proud.”

Ms. Khan’s appointment follows the departure of John Young, who had been scheduled to step down as CMHR president and CEO in August. He resigned early after public criticism began on social media when the museum tweeted in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. The museum was also accused of altering tours on request from some religious schools, omitting LGBTQ content.

Ms. Khan declined to comment on the specifics of the report, but noted that she will follow its recommendations, and do so with transparency.

The report, titled “Rebuilding the Foundation,” revealed that staff at the museum who persisted in efforts to address racism in the workplace were penalized, some branded by management as “troublemakers,” “difficult” or “angry.” Employees who were Black, Indigenous and people of colour reported being passed over for promotion in favour of equally or less-qualified white candidates.

The report said employees were subjected to racist treatment from visitors too, and management did not take action.

Staff were treated by management as being “over-sensitive” or emotionally weak for being unable to handle the discrimination, the report said.

One former employee, a Black woman who was about 20 when the harassment began, reported being stalked by a white museum member in his 60s. This went on for about two years.

The report found that LGBTQ content was hidden or omitted six times in 2017 and once in 2015.

It noted that the museum “neither explicitly acknowledged nor apologized for the racism perpetuated,” although it acknowledged that LGBTQ content was hidden, and apologized. “The apology has been viewed by many as tone deaf at best,” the report stated.

Its 44 recommendations include that the museum issue a “meaningful apology to Black and Indigenous people that is action-based.” It also recommends that a Black Canadian history tour be launched within 12 months, and that tours and programs with primarily Indigenous content be delivered only by Indigenous people. A number of recommendations call for training.

A second phase of the review will further explore the extent to which sexism has been an issue at the museum, as well as gendered racism, and barriers to employment for people with disabilities.

“I think that if people understand and are really driven by the mandate of having a respectful, inclusive workplace, we can get through this,” Khan said. “That also means doing some work to identify what discrimination and harassment look like so people can call it out and know how to respond to it.”

But among the Canadian artists she helped nurture, she was better known as “Mother Earth,” her demeanour as soulful and sincere as the voice that won her success both in the studio and onstage.

Bey, who began showing signs of dementia in 2004, died early Saturday morning at the Lakeside Long-Term Care Centre in Toronto, according to the family’s publicist. She was 86.

Singer and actor Jackie Richardson, who describes Bey as a mentor and “sister,” says her contributions to Canadian culture will live on in both the body of work she leaves behind and the talent she lifted up along the way.

“She definitely was an ambassador of what is wonderful and beautiful in our community of artists,” Richardson said by phone Monday.

“Salome was a bottomless pit of soul, the best in human values and being willing always to be that rock for those that needed a rock. That’s Mother Earth.”

Born in Newark, N.J., on Oct. 10, 1933, Bey toured the U.S., Europe and Canada as part of the sibling act Andy & the Bey Sisters.

In 1964, Bey moved to Toronto where she played the jazz club circuit, and soon made her mark on Canada’s music and theatre scenes.

She recorded two albums with renowned jazz pianist Horace Silver, and released albums of her live performances with the Montreal Jubilation Gospel Choir and at the Montreux Jazz Festival.

Bey also lent her vocal talents to the 1985 charity single, “Tears Are Not Enough,” as part of a Canadian supergroup that featured such artists as Joni Mitchell, Gordon Lightfoot and Bryan Adams. Produced by David Foster, the star-studded song aimed to raise funds for 1983-1985 Ethiopian famine.

She also earned a Grammy nomination for her work on the cast album of the Broadway show, “Your Arms Too Short to Box with God.” Other musical theatre credits include the 1972 off-Broadway show, “Justine,” for which she won an Obie Award.

Bey wrote and starred in “Indigo,” a cabaret about the history of Black music. The show, which won two Dora Mavor Moore Awards, was broadcast on CBC TV in 1984.

Richardson said Bey’s relentless work ethic, and the results onstage, served as an inspiration to countless artists coming up behind her.

Bey took on the role of teacher with her typical generosity and grace, Richardson said.

Her children’s musical, “Rainboworld,” served as a launching pad for many young up-and-comers on their path to stardom, including award-winning soul singer Divine Brown.

“I got my feet wet literally through the opportunities that she presented to me at the very ripe age of 12,” Brown said in a phone interview.

“She played that role for a lot of young, aspiring Black singers in this city.”

Bey’s commitment to Canada’s creative community won her a 1992 Toronto Arts Award, and the Martin Luther King Jr. Award for lifetime achievement from the Black Theatre Workshop of Montreal in 1996.

In 2005, Bey was made an honorary member of the Order of Canada, which Richardson sees as an acknowledgment of her status as a national treasure.

“She definitely was that Canadian star,” Richardson said. “She belongs beside all the greatest of the musicians internationally.”

Bey is survived by her two daughters, the singer SATE and performance artist tUkU, and son Marcus Matthews."

Brought to you by At Home is a five-part series that asks Canadians to share what home ownership means to them from the perspective of the head and the heart. Contemplating making upgrades to your home? Advice from an HSBC mortgage specialist can help make it happen.

When Heather and Wesley Corbett bought their home in New Westminster, B.C., 13 years ago, they weren’t gardeners.

With two young sons at the time, the couple wanted a yard, but they didn’t imagine it would become their sanctuary.

“The garden is really what we’ve put our hearts into. I don’t think either my husband or I knew that we would get so much joy from the effort we put in,” says Heather, 44.

Story continues below advertisement

“We regularly take a drink and go on a tour of the garden. It sounds funny, but we just go and see how the plants are doing and we walk around and observe what’s growing and what’s blooming, and it really is something we love doing together.”

The garden has also been a relaxing place for the family to spend time during the pandemic.

“We’ve done a lot of work on the garden,” Heather says of the past few months as COVID-19 health measures have forced people to stay home.

Before renewing their mortgage in May, the Corbetts considered whether it was time to move into a bigger home.

“Every time we come back to the fact that we don’t really want to leave the area or the garden. So, we said, ‘no, let’s not,’” Heather says.

Public health guidance encouraging people to stay home has also allowed time for her husband, 51, to build a basketball hoop with one son and a lawn game with the other.

“They had fun doing that together,” she says. “I’ve certainly been very grateful for the fact that we have our house and our yard.”

Story continues below advertisement

Heather grew up in Vancouver. When the couple moved back home after a stint in the United Kingdom, they realized they couldn’t afford a house in that city, so broadened their search to the suburbs.

New Westminster appealed to them because of its history, small-town feel and location on the banks of the Fraser River.

They found a house with “good bones,” a good school nearby and a ton of potential. They took possession in the fall of 2007.

“We maybe didn’t know it at the time, but our community is a huge factor for us. We really appreciate where we live and the tight-knit, close community that we are a part of,” Heather says.

The house needed work, though. In 2010, spurred by low-interest rates and big ideas, the Corbetts refinanced their mortgage to be able to take on an extensive renovation. They added a two-storey addition to the back of the house and a deck.

Even after paying the penalty for getting out of their five-year mortgage early, the rates made the investment worthwhile.

“We went from quite a high-interest rate to a really low-interest rate,” Heather says.

The house that cost about $460,000 in 2007 has since more than doubled in value. While it was a big investment at the time, the Corbetts have never second-guessed their decision to buy in the Metro Vancouver market.

Wesley is a graphic designer who has worked from home for many years. Heather is a committee clerk for the City of New Westminster. With the entire family now at home during the lockdown, there’s enough room for everyone to have their own space.

The Corbetts’ lenders have also provided the couple very favourable lines of credit over the years, along with the mortgage.

“It has come in handy,” she says of the lines of credit, “to get us through some tight spots [and with] different things we wanted to do to the house.”

Having a home-equity line of credit (HELOC) is a good idea and can be used for a wide-range of uses, from home renovations to helping with the cost of a child’s education, says Matt Mercer, Head of the Mortgage Centre at HSBC Bank Canada in Toronto.

“A HELOC is one option to finance expected and unexpected expenses at a low-interest cost,” Matt says. “The benefit of a HELOC is that it allows you to use your hard-earned equity without having to requalify each time, and because you are not breaking your mortgage early, there is no penalty.”

He recommends homeowners discuss their wants and needs with a mortgage specialist, who will help them find the best solution to match their unique circumstances.

“The mortgage specialist will review your full situation, including your current mortgage rate, other obligations that you have, and any future plans and financing needs,” Matt says.

The garden is really what we’ve put our hearts into. I don’t think either my husband or I knew that we would get so much joy from the effort we put in. HEATHER CORBETT

What advice to the Corbetts have for other homeowners?

Heather recommends they start by making a list of what will make them happy. For instance, she and her husband knew they didn’t want the hassle of traversing any bridges or tunnels on their daily commute.

“That was our rule. We stuck to it and have never regretted it,” Heather says.

Story continues below advertisement

And put some time into researching potential neighbourhoods, she says. You may not be able to afford your first choice, but you can make sure you’ll be happy in an area you can afford.

“I drove around a lot of areas to get a feel for what the community was like and also what kind of future it had,” she says.

When they moved in, there were very few amenities nearby, but before they bought, she found out there were plans for a retail development nearby. They now have a grocery store, drug store, restaurant and Starbucks within walking distance.

“Make sure you’re going to be happy there and there’s going to be the ability to work and play,” Heather says.

Matt of HSBC cautions that everyone’s situation is unique.

“What worked for the Corbett’s might not work for you,” he says. “That’s why it’s important to work with a bank – like HSBC – that has a team of mortgage specialists that can help you understand your current situation and put a plan in place to turn your dreams into a reality.”

For almost 70 years, Behrends Group in Edmonton built its success by producing and designing cast bronze, aluminum and brass plaques, signage, works of art, memorials and interpretive displays. That changed in March when COVID-19 brought their operations to a grinding halt. Its foundry and manufacturing facility went quiet as orders for products dried up. To remain viable, the small business had to pivot and adapt.

“The pandemic slowed everything down to a crawl,” says company president Gen Russo, who has worked for Behrends for more than 30 years. “Projects were put on hold and there was not much work. Then some of our clients started requesting sneeze guards – something we had never built before.” Fortunately, the business already had the equipment on hand and the capability to make the transition.

Behrends also expanded its printing services to meet the new need for safety and social-distancing protocol signage. Russo says a typical large building needs as many as 500 to 600 signs, thus creating a big demand.

Story continues below advertisement

“As a small business, you have to be able to quickly respond to what’s happening in the marketplace. So, when the pandemic hit, we adapted and created new products using the talent and skills of our great staff,” says Russo. “And because of that, we were able to keep all of our 30 employees working.”

He credits his company’s ability to navigate through the pandemic to having strong relationships with customers, suppliers and advisors, including its insurance partners. “We asked for advice from our network and they came through with the assistance that helped us make good decisions,” Russo says.

Recently, Behrends decided to switch from its insurance provider of 20 years to Foster Park Brokers. Russo liked their high level of service, competitive rates and proactive approach. For example, his insurance broker suggested bringing in experts on risk management, to help Behrends avoid potential disruption of its operations as the business evolved.

Mark Wiens, the president of Foster Park Brokers, sees this kind of client education as part of his company’s role. “It’s unrealistic to expect our clients to understand the nuances in the wordings of insurance policies,” he says. “That’s our job as brokers. The more we understand the operations and risk tolerance of our clients, the better job we can do when it comes to providing them with the right advice.”

Open this photo in gallery Amber Bracken

There is no one-size-fits-all solution and an insurance broker can help a business ensure it has enough coverage as its operations evolve. Wiens adds that ongoing risk assessments can help address potential blind spots like cyber protection, which is becoming increasingly important as many small businesses shift to online sales.

“Business owners often have to make quick decisions which can unintentionally affect their risk. This is happening now, more than ever, as small businesses adapt and pivot their operations due to the pandemic,” he says.

Small businesses that have started manufacturing health-related products because of COVID-19 may also face a variety of new safety and risk exposures – some of which they may overlook. That’s where a broker and insurer can step in, work with the business to identify potential exposures and provide a plan to manage them.

Story continues below advertisement

Petra Hoerrmann, an underwriting director representing Northbridge Insurance who insures Behrends, says the three parties working closely together is key, especially in extraordinary times like these.

“It’s a unique time for everyone,” she says. “Many of our small business customers had to quickly evolve their operations and we evolved right along with them. With Behrends, that meant ensuring constant communication, answering questions quickly and sharing information and resources that we felt could help them safely navigate change.”

For Behrends, having the support of trusted partners made it possible for the company to quickly shift its focus to supporting the needs of its customers and community.

As Russo explains, “My insurer continues to help protect our business in uncertain times. That has given us a lot of confidence as we move forward.”

There’s a certain magic that happens when people are reunited with foods that remind them of their roots. It’s something that Andrea Macikova and Vlad Forgac witness regularly at YourOh! Deli, the authentic European delicatessen they run in Langley, B.C.

Forgac recalls one of these special moments last summer, when a customer spotted a European chocolate bar she hadn’t seen since her childhood.

“She stopped in her tracks,” Forgac says. “She slowly walked over and began welling up, saying, ‘I used to eat these when I was a little girl.’”

“She picked one up and held it with such admiration that I was moved,” he says. “That’s when I knew a European deli was much more than just a little food store.”

Open this photo in gallery Langley, B.C.'s YourOh! Deli prides itself on serving the highest-quality European imported goods. SUPPLIED

Serving specialty goods from throughout the 27 European Union (EU) state members has become more than a business for the pair; it’s a passion.

Macikova hails from Vranov Nad Topl’ou in Eastern Slovakia, while Forgac is originally from Bratislava, the country’s capital. The pair launched YourOh! Deli in December 2018. (The name is meant to sound like “Euro.”) The 900-square-foot shop quickly became a neighbourhood draw with products from all over Europe – represented on a map that adorns one shop wall.

Operating in a multicultural region like B.C.‘s Lower Mainland, a 45-minute drive from Vancouver, YourOh! Deli has a diverse clientele. Many shoppers have roots in Eastern Europe, including Romania, Croatia, and the Czech Republic. For this reason, the deli stocks a variety of food products that allow customers to connect with their culture, while helping others discover the true taste of Europe for the first time. Think Pawelek chocolate bars from Poland; Erfrischungsstäbchen lemon-orange chocolates from Germany; Burek cheese pies, popular in Croatia and Slovenia; Slovakian Oštiepok smoked sheep cheese; or Hungarian peppers stuffed with sauerkraut.

As was the case for so many businesses, COVID-19 introduced new challenges for YourOh! Deli. Macikova and Forgac initially curtailed their hours, developed an online ordering platform and offered private shopping to ensure their clientele could continue to access the high-quality European goods they treasured during the pandemic’s darkest hours.

Open this photo in gallery Andrea Macikova and Vlad Forgac founded YourOh! deli in 2018 to unite members of the European diaspora with foods from their roots, SUPPLIED

What the couple found, however, was that the overwhelming majority of customers still wanted to shop in person, to look at labels and designations and read about the products – despite limitations and lineups presented by physical distancing orders. Currently, up to three people are permitted in the store at a time, and it’s not uncommon to see customers waiting patiently outside for their turn. Macikova and Forgac attribute this to carrying authentic European goods and working hard to continually diversify their EU offerings to ensure variety for their clientele.

“The most important element in solidifying our client base has been adapting to our customers,” Forgac says. “We’re constantly branching out, contacting new suppliers and importers and bakeries and meat producers.”

Luckily, The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), has opened even more opportunities for businesses like YourOh!, making storied European products readily available to Canadian food retailers and consumers alike.

“We have a huge number of customers from Eastern Europe who are extremely passionate about the foods they grew up with,” he says. “So, for them to come in and find items they are familiar with is huge. And for them to know that we will do what we can to seek out and bring in items we don’t have in stock is forging the whole ‘neighbourhood European deli’ mission we set out initially.”

More and more, people want to know where their food comes from. With traditional and authentic European foods, customers should look for EU Geographical Indications. The distinctive red and yellow stamp identifies that the ingredients, production and preparation of a product are all from or took place in a specific geographical area. The blue and yellow stamp is used to identify the products in which a particular quality of production is attributed to its geographic origin. These labels ensure that what customers are buying is authentic and of the highest quality standards.

For Macikova and Forgac, the foods they carry act as a bridge between people and places. By stocking the best of Europe, they aim to help satisfy consumers’ appetites for food that offers a real experience, combined with high safety standards – that feeds their souls as much as their stomachs.

It was midway through March when Joe Moscato, vice president of sales and marketing at Aurora Importing, noticed pantry items like dried pasta, polenta, rice, canned tomatoes, canned beans, tuna and olive oil flying off shelves.

Seemingly overnight, demand for staples skyrocketed by up to 400 per cent as lockdown orders fell into place and Canadians pivoted to eating every meal at home. Staff across the family-run importing and distributing company worked around the clock to meet rapidly changing consumer demands for their favourite European foods.

Aurora was far from alone in the challenges it faced: COVID-19 disrupted the entire global food supply chain, affecting everyone from the workers planting and harvesting crops to the grocery store clerks stocking shelves.

Looking back, Moscato credits the company’s ability to rise to the challenge to its legacy as one of the largest, most reliable, well-resourced importers of authentic European goods into Canada.

“We have longstanding partnerships with many of our suppliers and producers,” Moscato says. “Despite the onset of COVID-19 in Europe and here in Canada during the first outbreak in mid-March, we were well-positioned to supply the market’s unprecedented demand.”

For many consumers, spending time at home has underscored the importance of high-quality imported ingredients. Increases in demand for popular products meant many goods were hard to get ahold of; but Moscato and his team at Aurora worked hard to ensure that Canadians were able to connect with the European foods they’d come to know and love.

In fact, keeping up with consumer needs has always been a part of Aurora’s DNA: In 1955, Nunzio Tumino, a new immigrant from Sicily, opened a grocery store in the west end of Toronto. On his trips back to Italy, Tumino’s immigrant customers often asked him to bring back the foods they missed. He started supplying other local retailers with specialty European foods like oils, canned tomatoes and pasta, and eventually, Aurora became one of the first major importing companies in Canada.

To this day, the organization continues to be driven by a desire to unite members of the European diaspora with foods from their roots while offering other Canadians the opportunity to explore new cuisines. Though Aurora began with Italian products, they’ve expanded and now source foods from all over Europe, including ale beer from Germany, and speculoos biscuits from Belgium (or ‘speculaas’ if from the Netherlands.)

“Italian is who we are at our core and that will never change,” Moscato says. “But as the Canadian demographics continue to evolve and diversify, so do we.”

Products like Aurora’s play as vital a role on Canadians’ shelves as they do within the national economy: According to Sylvain Charlebois, professor and senior director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University, Canada’s unique weather patterns pose limits to what’s possible to produce from home. Imports are left to fill in gaps.

Story continues below advertisement

“Our growing season is limited compared to many other nations,” Charlebois says. “We’re at the mercy of mother nature.”

He adds that importing food strengthens Canada’s economy as a whole. “As a trading nation, you can benefit from relationships you build abroad,” he says. “Maybe the initial intent is to buy [food from other countries], but you may end up buying other stuff and building relationships with companies that eventually buy more products from Canada.”

This became easier after the 2017 passage of The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the European Union (EU), which offers protection for European and Canadian foods with Geographical Indications (GIs), ensuring that products are from where they say they are. For example, Aurora products like Aceto Balsamico di Modena (PGI) – a vinegar from the Modena region – and Pomodoro San Marzano dell’Agro Sarnese-Nocerino (PDO) – tomatoes grown under the shade of Mount Vesuvius in San Marzano sul Sarno – are labelled with GIs to confirm their geographic authenticity. These EU labels guarantee the authenticity of products, as well as their high quality and strict production standards.

This kind of protection is vital given the sheer diversity of Europe, its cultures and its culinary traditions, Charlebois notes.

The Montreal-based, French-trained chef and entrepreneur peppers his conversations, his cooking and his classes with stories.

Open this photo in gallery SUPPLIED

“When I’m giving a cooking class, I tell a story about a Nonna in Italy,” he says. “She’s going to cook a simple polenta for her family, and you know what? That’s what we’re making today, it’s going to be delicious, use authentic ingredients and you can make it, too.”

Through his cooking lessons and social media channels, Garnier’s students enthusiastically cook polenta, vegetarian polpette and fresh pasta. Throughout all aspects of La Guilde Culinaire, the chef’s boutique and culinary school in Montreal’s Little Italy, he places emphasis on quality ingredients, taste and technique, skillfully blending local Quebec ingredients with the fine European foods he loves, like Italian Pecorino Romano (PDO) and Spanish Jamón Serrano (PGI).

Story continues below advertisement

“Each of these products have their stories,” Garnier says. “The tastes are always honest and authentic, and come with their own history and perfected technique based on years of producer experience, history and tradition.”

Garnier shares the stories of these flavours with his students, too. “I love the tradition of charcuterie from the Baltics and get my students to taste the dry sausages and cold cuts with local beer,” he says. “Or I send them to Montreal’s great cheese stores to look for the flavour profiles in the same kind of cheese from different countries, like Feta cheese (PDO) from Greece and Bulgarian traditional soft cheeses. When they start to detect these differences…they’re truly learning and enjoying.”

With both his large-event catering services and grab-and-go lunch counter in downtown Montreal suspended for the moment, La Guilde Culinaire’s online kitchen equipment and pantry ingredient boutique – stocked aplenty with authentic European Union’s (EU) goods, like Paella rice from Valencia, Spain and infused vinegar and olive oils from France – has become the power engine of the business. “We’re shipping four to five times more during this time than pre-COVID,” the chef says. “Everyone is cooking at home now.”

This offers a unique learning opportunity for Garnier’s students – more than ever before, Canadians are making moments in their own kitchens, uniting over quality local and imported ingredients and sharing meals made with love. By bringing the best European imports into the homes of Canadians, Garnier has brought many back to their roots, while taking others into a new world of taste.

With The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) in place between the European Union and Canada, European products are within easier reach than some might expect for importers, retailers and consumers in Canada. Whether cheeses, meats, olive oils, fruits, produce, confectionery, beer or wine, European products are uniquely positioned to meet the changing preferences and appetites of the Canadian shopper, who places an ever-greater premium on quality, safety and authenticity.

Garnier leverages the accessibility to EU products in his cooking philosophy, based on what he calls his “little drawers of taste”: banks of flavour that he keeps in his mind from his travels and training and uses to inform every dish. Finding the correct, authentic ingredients to fit in each drawer has been essential to his creative process as a chef. “Think about olives from Greece or Spain, and combining them with Quebec pork – it’s terrific,” he says. “Or pistachios from Italy and local double cream. You’ll make the most delicious ice cream you’ve ever had.”

Knowing where an ingredient is coming from is key. Garnier looks for European Union Geographical Indications – products carrying the blue or yellow seal Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) and Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) confirming a product’s origins and authenticity – to ensure that what he’s buying is the real deal.

Story continues below advertisement

“I tell my students to get all the information they can about a product before they buy it and serve it to their friends and family,” Garnier says. “Then they can tell the story of the origins of the food and the history of the producers. That’s as much part of the sharing as the cooking.”

“I’m always going to put love into my food,” the convivial chef adds. “And with European ingredients, we can always share a great story, too.”

First, dried beans flew off the shelves. Then, public health orders closed thousands of restaurants. Luxury takeout took off. Baking sourdough became a national pastime. Now sidewalk patios are springing up like mushrooms. Nobody knows what’s next for the food industry.

“We’re walking through a dark room with our hands out in front of us, trying to feel everything out until things settle down,” says restaurateur, businessman and Top Chef Canada judge Mark McEwan.

Few in the sector have as broad a perspective as McEwan, whose Toronto-based company, the McEwan Group, includes a catering business, manufacturing, high-end grocery stores and several fine-dining restaurants.

Story continues below advertisement

He’s concentrated on building an online shopping platform for groceries and pre-prepared meals, subsidizing half the cost of pickup and delivery in order to build customer loyalty.

“We try to make it memorable,” he says. “We send people a lot of free samples and try to be helpful on the phone.”

That exceptional experience includes stocking the best ingredients. McEwan believes importing high-quality European products has given his stores a leg up during challenging times.

“I think when people have a meal together now, it’s more of a special occasion that demands special ingredients,” he says.

“I carry a lot of European products in the retail stores. I’m very supportive of local ingredients, but I’m also supportive of imported European food because it’s produced to such an exceptional standard. My clients love it. I love it. I’ll never go totally local: It’s about finding a marriage of the two.”

Certain products have been smash hits in isolation. McEwan says his stores can’t import doppio zero flour, made from Italian durum wheat, fast enough. His clients have been exploring canned cuttlefish and anchovies from the Spanish region of Galicia. Belgian chocolate has proven popular as a socially distant snack.

And as consumers have more time to prepare their own meals, he’s been pleased to see more demand for ingredients like French vinegar, German redcurrant jelly, Italian olive oil and Portuguese chorizo that form the base of slow-cooked European classics like pot-au-feu, beef bourguignon, sauerbraten and paella.

“It’s great because when I’m looking for inspiration, I turn to the old cookbooks more than I do modern ones,” McEwan says. “They lean mainly on European products. You can pick up Julia Child and start recreating some French standards. You can do the same for Italy, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Poland. There’s just such a rich history, you don’t have to reinvent the wheel.”

The key appeal of food from the European Union (EU), says McEwan, is the consistency and quality. There’s a high level of government supervision of the food system, and buyers can look for blue and yellow European Union Geographical Indication labels that prove products are made in a certain place and to a certain standard.

“The fact that people are interested in European standards and quality levels is the most exciting trend,” he says. “It’s going to last. It’s a sign that we’ve matured as a society when it comes to food; we don’t get caught up in fads, it’s all about the ingredients and the backstory. That in itself is a European attitude.”

It’s hard to be bored in and around New Brunswick’s historic capital city. Located just a foot trail away from the great outdoors, Fredericton offers a wide range of ways to spend a day with the whole family. Home to the highest number of craft brewers per capita in Canada, you’re just as likely to stumble upon a museum or market as you are a microbrewery in this east coast town. And with the Radisson Kingswood Hotel & Suites so close to the action of the city, kicking back and relaxing has never been easier.

Here are seven ways to spend your next vacation in Fredericton.

Shop local food, art and more

Thanks to its lively arts scene and proximity to organic farms, Fredericton is renowned for its many markets. The iconic Boyce Farmers Market, the Food Market at the Ex and the newly relocated Cultural Market are all open for business with social distancing regulations in place. Launched in 2020, the ECO Market promotes sustainable living with environmentally-conscious arts, crafts and fresh produce. The city is also filled with galleries dedicated to Canadian artwork and products, such as Gallery on Queen and the Beaverbrook Art Gallery.

Find fun for the family, indoors and out

Fredericton is home to an expansive 120 kilometre network of hiking and biking trails, 20 kilometres of which surround sandy beach and tranquil lake at Killarney Lake Park. Step out for a hike with the kids or float down the Nashwaak River on an inner-tube with Nashwaak Tubing. Go on an aerial adventure course, available for all skill levels, at Treego in Mactaquac. Or, spend a family day at Kingswood Entertainment Centre, the largest indoor entertainment facility in Atlantic Canada with 30 lanes of bowling, laser tag and arcade games (social distancing guidelines and meticulous cleaning procedures are in place to ensure safety.)

Golf on some of New Brunswick’s best greens

Named the best new golf course in Canada by Golf Digest in 2003, Kingswood Golf Course continues to rank as one of the county’s best courses and is a destination in itself. This award-winning 27-hole golf course designed by Darrell Huxham and Graham Cooke attracts golfers from around the world to its magnificent greens. “Masterfully bunkered, with wide-open fairways, Kingswood focuses on its unique surroundings utilizing the natural rock outcroppings and marshlands, which creates a challenge for the expert player without being overly taxing on the novice,” says Chris Billings, Kingswood’s director of golf.

Kick back in a calming atmosphere

Just 15 minutes from the vibrant city centre, the Radisson Kingswood Hotel & Suites offers stunning views of the internationally-renowned Kingswood Golf Course. The newly-built hotel has spacious rooms and suites, a state-of-the-art gym, business centre, babysitting service, free Wi-Fi and complimentary parking. Pet-friendly rooms are also available to accommodate four-legged family members. “The hotel is a beautiful modern design,” says Brian Johnson, president and owner of the Radisson Kingswood hotel. “The hotel patio and fire pits overlook the pond with gorgeous views of the award-winning Kingswood Golf Course. It’s a relaxing atmosphere surrounded by nature.”

Living up to Fredericton’s reputation as “Atlantic Canada’s Brewing Capital,” the hotel’s Bistro Brew Lounge offers a wide selection of local Maritime brews on tap, including their own signature cider, the BBL Pomegranate. Radisson Kingswood has special travel packages available, including a “Stay and Play for Two” golf getaway, which includes overnight accommodations, breakfast and green fees for two. New Brunswick residents can apply for an additional 20 per cent rebate as part of the Explore NB Travel Incentive program.

Indulge in Atlantic Canada’s best eats

You can’t go wrong dining out in Fredericton. At 11th mile, chef Peter Tompkins and wife Jennie Wilson showcase their Maritime roots through an ever-changing menu of down-home twists on globally-inspired sharing plates and delicious cocktails. The Cabin Restaurant is a roadside institution and the best place to get a classic diner-style lobster roll. Sam Snead’s Oak Grill and Tavern at the Kingswood Lodge is a go-to culinary destination for foodies and golfers alike, thanks to its open flame wood grill. The only Sam Snead’s location in Canada, it’s located inside the Kingswood Golf Course and is consistently ranked as one of the city’s top restaurants.

Pour down a pint (or three)

Well-known as a craft beer hub, Fredericton has something for just about every brew-lover. As the microbrewery that put the city on the map, The Picaroons Roundhouse is a must-visit for British-style ales. Or, try the New England Cider at the hip Queen Street location of Red Rover Cider, the first cider house in the province. Pair brews with wood-fired pizzas on the spacious patio at RustiCo and King West Brewing, or try the weekly rotating experimental cask at Trailway Brewing on the north side of the city. Microbrewery enthusiasts can challenge themselves to take the Fredericton Taproom Trail, which features stops at 11 of the city’s celebrated craft beer producers.

Step back in time

An award-winning open-air museum with 70 historic homes and buildings on 300 acres of land, Kings Landing functions like an authentic Loyalist settlement. Costumed characters bring history to life in early 19th century homes, print shops, sawmills, blacksmith stalls and barns. No visit to Fredericton would be complete without a walk through the Garrison district, a national historic site. With good timing, you can catch the changing of the guard, complete with a piper and drummer, in front of City Hall daily through the end of August.

Harleen Puaar Shukla remembers the moment Sault Ste. Marie first felt like home. She’d recently arrived from New Delhi, where she grew up, to study public relations and events management at Sault College. A friend of a friend invited Shukla to a dinner party with other members of the city’s Indian community. “I did not know that there was a [sizeable] Indian population here,” she says. “So that, I think, was the moment where I felt okay.”

Still, Shukla wondered if she’d have an easier time building her career in a bigger city. She ended up moving to Toronto—but after a couple of months, she realized that it wasn’t where she wanted to be.

“It was so different living in Sault Ste. Marie, because I wasn't used to [the pace],” she says. “When I was in Toronto, I felt like I was back in New Delhi. It's the same lifestyle. And I think that's why I made that choice to come back to the Soo.”

As a vibrant community of 73,000, Sault Ste. Marie has all the amenities of a larger Canadian city, with the safety of a smaller one. Locals have always recognized the city’s adventurous charms, including world-class fly fishing, kilometres of cross-country ski trails and easy access to canoe tripping—but now a growing number of adventure enthusiasts and even less outdoorsy city folk are relocating to Northern Ontario.

With real estate prices rising in cities like Toronto and its surrounding suburbs, Sault Ste. Marie has become an attractive option—it’s affordable, welcoming and laid-back. What’s more, home ownership is achievable in the northern city; the Canadian Real Estate Association reported that the average cost of a home in the Sault in March 2019 was $184,810. And these transplants are sticking around. According to a 2019 report¹ from Public Policy Forum and Pathways to Prosperity, 73.4 per cent of the immigrants who arrived in the city between 2007 and 2011 were still living there five years later.

Shukla isn’t the only millennial putting down roots in Sault Ste. Marie. Dr. Jenna Rebelo moved to Sault Ste. Marie from Hamilton, Ont. in Jan. 2019 with her husband, Mike, and their one-year-old son, Felix. The couple had been living in their hometown while she finished her last year of residency for medical school at McMaster University. One day while on mat leave, she got a text message about a job opportunity in the Soo.

“My initial thought was, I’ve never been to Northern Ontario ever. I am not outdoorsy. So, you know, sure, I’ll look into it, but I didn’t think too much of it,” she says.

That is, until she spent two weeks visiting Sault Area Hospital. “The longer I was there, the more I got this sense that I needed to come back,” says Rebelo, an ears nose and throat specialist. “I felt like, I can't imagine that I'm not going to see these people again. I already feel like I belong here.”

That feeling didn’t go away when they actually moved to the Soo. In fact, Mike says the community made his own transition much easier. “It's a bit of a leap of faith, [ moving to a ] place that you don't know anybody,” he says. But people went out of their way to make him feel welcome, including the car salesman who sold the couple a second vehicle—and invited Mike to join his softball team.

Rebelo also knew moving to the Sault would be the right move for her career. It can be difficult to attract doctors to the North, but she knew working in a smaller city meant she’d get a chance to do more, sooner. “The neat thing about practising here is that you really can explore the full depth of practice and not just the breadth,” she says. “People are so happy when I tell them that they don't have to go down south for their ear surgeries—I can do it right here.”

Like Rebelo, Teni Araba, director of human resources at Algoma University, says she also fell for the city before she even knew she’d be living here. At first, it was about the Soo’s natural beauty—and abundant space. “It is serene, it is naturally beautiful, picturesque. I always say you can’t take a bad picture in the Soo; it just can’t happen,” she says. And when she realized that you can get anywhere in the Soo in 15 minutes or less, she was thrilled to spend less time commuting than she used to in Regina, Sask.

But it took actually moving to the Soo with her husband Gabriel and their three kids—14-year-old Romi, six-year-old Jola and four-year-old Fami—to understand how great the city is for young families. “[We have] the opportunity to raise our kids in a friendly, welcoming place,” she says. It’s not just about access to the outdoors; the family attends the United Baptist Church, and take lessons at the Algoma Conservatory of Music.

They all stress how warm and welcoming the city is. For Shukla, who met her now-husband at that first dinner party and has now lived in the Soo for almost six years, there’s no place she’d rather be. “It's an ideal place because you get the real Canadian experience here. And you're not spending hours on commuting. Instead, you're spending time with family. I think it’s a great place to put down roots.”

Ottawa is an active city that takes four-seasons outdoor fun as seriously as its love for lively local arts and culture, excellent restaurants and craft brewing.

Ottawa resident Andrew Szeto is passionate about Ottawa’s sports and recreation scene. It’s just so easy for locals and visitors to be active in the city, he says. In summer, he can often be found canoeing on the waters around Ottawa, using one of the stunning hand-crafted paddles he makes.

While visitors from other cities may have to endure long drives to reach hiking trails and dedicated cycling paths back home, so many things that truly elevate an active getaway can be done either right in walkable Ottawa, or within a short drive.

“I’d say certainly the beautiful thing about our city is within 20 minutes you can be in great wilderness in Gatineau Park. And the fall, with the leaves, it’s pretty incredible,” says Szeto, who has called Ottawa home for 10 years."

At 42 years old, it was her first full-term pregnancy after experiencing two preterm births – of which neither child survived.

Kone, who lives in a rural village in the southern region of Mali, says Born on Time’s program, implemented by Save the Children in Mali, was essential to keeping her informed about her reproductive health, supporting her throughout her pregnancy and helping her deliver her son safely.

“Thanks to the assistance of the program, I was more confident knowing that I had support. I am happy that this baby is safe,” Kone says.

Poor access to health care and low rates of female autonomy are among the many roadblocks that women in Mali face when pregnant. About 12 per cent of babies are born prematurely in the West African country – most of whom have a low chance of survival, as 30 per cent of neonatal deaths are due to prematurity.

Born on Time is tackling this issue through a holistic, community-based approach. The initiative aims to improve the quality of reproductive health services throughout the Sikasso Region in Southern Mali, and equip couples like Kone and her husband with the tools they need to support a healthy pregnancy. This includes knowledge of preterm birth risk factors, and the importance of antenatal visits, vaccinations and healthy, nutritious foods."

And why wouldn’t Conrad enjoy himself? He gets to play with the newest gadgets, wear the freshest gear and travel to far-flung locations. Not bad for someone who only started making YouTube videos as a hobby in 2012.

If all that sounds impossibly glamorous, then it should be some comfort to know that keeping it real is a big part of Conrad’s personality. After growing up in Toronto and briefly playing professional soccer in the Netherlands (Conrad’s father is Dutch), he studied kinesiology and did a master’s in health informatics. He happily admits to holding down a regular, full-time job as a manager at a Toronto mental health hospital. He shoots and edits his videos in the evenings and on weekends.

“It’s honestly a hobby of mine, it’s just grown into something way larger than I would have thought,” he admits in one of his videos."

Going stir crazy after five months in lockdown? Finding ways to get out of the house can help. Why not take a staycation?

A staycation is the perfect remedy for the lockdown blues; it combines the convenience of staying in your own city with the glamour and excitement of a vacation. Better yet, do it in Canada’s liveliest urban hub: The Radisson Admiral Hotel Toronto-Harbourfront offers serene lakeside views and proximity to all that downtown has to offer.

It’s the ideal stay “for people that are really curious about the city,” says the hotel’s general manager Nathalie Lalonde. So, get out of the house, and visit a Radisson hotel to begin your next urban adventure.

Here are five things to do on a COVID-safe staycation in Toronto.

Explore Toronto by bike

The Radisson Admiral’s proximity to Toronto’s harbourfront makes it easy to explore the southernmost region of the city. Wander the boardwalk and feel Lake Ontario’s fresh breeze before hopping on a Toronto Bike Share bike and taking the Martin Goodman Trail west of the downtown core. On weekends, look out for road closures along Lakeshore Boulevard – the stretches of highway are currently reserved for bicycle use only on Saturdays and Sundays. The vast, open road offers plenty of space for first-timers and avid cyclists, alike.

Wine and dine

Toronto’s harbourfront boasts a wide range of restaurants and cafes, many of which have continued offering takeout throughout the pandemic.

As you head out of the hotel, visit Cafè Locale, located adjacent to the hotel’s main lobby for a delicious cup of coffee or a salad and sandwich. A menu of fresh brews and baked goods is accompanied by a range of iced teas, smoothies and gelatos, ideal for hot summer days. The café also sells Flying Hound pupsicles for four-legged friends. In fact, you might spot Lalonde here picking up her morning chai latte or mid-afternoon matcha. “Cafè Locale is a really nice place to be,” Lalonde says.

For excellent views of the lake, head to Boxcar Social for a cortado or latte overlooking the water. Beer lovers should check out Amsterdam BrewHouse, where fresh, creative beers are crafted and served from its on-site brewery. Both spots are open for takeout and patio dining.

Adventure through Ripley’s aquarium

Families and staycationers of any age will appreciate spending a day wandering through Ripley’s Aquarium of Canada. Recently reopened with a new set of safety protocols, the aquarium is home to over 20,000 aquatic animals. See sharks up-close in the lagoon gallery – a conveyer belt that runs through a tunnel-shaped tank – and pet four species of stingray in the Ray Bay gallery. This immersive aquarium is unlike any other, and it’s just a seven-minute walk from Radisson Admiral Hotel Toronto-Harbourfront.

Head outside the city

Those looking for a getaway from the city can easily venture to the beaches of Toronto Islands by ferry or Tiki Taxi – small, private cab-style boats that cost around $10 each way. Recently reopened to the public, the stretch of 15 islands offer relaxing beaches, toe and bike paths and canoe and kayak rentals. Take the kids, a few drinks or a good book and spend the day in the sand.

Rest and rejuvenate

After a long day exploring the city, return to Radisson Admiral Hotel Toronto-Harbourfront for a home-away-from-home experience. Squeeze in a run along the harbourfront, or dip into the Lakeview Pool Lounge, the fifth-floor outdoor pool that offers ample lounging space, cocktail and bottle service, weekend barbecues and impeccable views of the lake.

Story continues below advertisement

Those planning trips for cooler days can look forward to seeing the Radisson Admiral Hotel Toronto-Harbourfront with a whole new look. As it converts to an upscale Radisson Blu later this year, the waterfront hotel is ushering in new amenities across all 157 of its rooms, including new corridors, mattresses, bedding and wall art. “We have pictures of Toronto to match the beautiful views of the CN Tower and Lake Ontario from our rooms,” Lalonde says.

Additionally, Radisson Admiral Hotel Toronto-Harbourfront has implemented the Radisson Hotels Safety Protocol program in partnership with SGS, the world’s leading inspection, verification, testing and certification company. The in-depth 20-step cleanliness and disinfection protocols ensure guest safety and peace of mind from check-in to check-out. So, leave the worrying to Radisson Hotels and enjoy your time away.

Please note: Due to COVID-19, the hours and availability of food service, pools, fitness centres and other amenities may be disrupted — contact Radisson Admiral Hotel Toronto-Harbourfront directly for specific details.

The world is ever-changing and, for businesses, keeping pace is a matter of survival. The same can be said of business education.

But as costs soar for a traditional Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree, some are questioning the return on investment (ROI) and relevance of this mainstay of business education.

Edward Snyder, the former dean of the Yale School of Management, has criticized the trajectory of traditional MBAs.

Story continues below advertisement

“Many of the schools have collectively marched off the cliff with these tuition increases,” Mr. Snyder says in Forbes magazine. “That has reduced some of the ROI on the degree… [M]any schools have found themselves in a tuition trap in which they cannot find a market for their programs… .”

Luminaries like technology billionaire Mark Cuban and Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg have also publicly questioned the value of the traditional MBA, long considered the key to the C-suite.

The high cost and often outdated content of many MBA programs have many people looking for alternatives.

“Traditional MBAs have been almost the same for the last 30 years and the world has changed and continues to change so fast,” says Rafael Gozalo, co-founder and co-CEO of ThePowerMBA, an online business education platform from Europe that recently launched in Canada.

Open this photo in gallery Rafael Gozalo, co-founder and co-CEO of ThePowerMBA, says his online program is not only a lower-cost alternative to traditional MBAs but also more efficient and real-world relevant. SUPPLIED

Business education is ripe for disruption, Mr. Gozalo says.

Here are five reasons why the MBA needs a revamp — and some solutions:

1. Does an MBA have to cost so much?

Story continues below advertisement

The degree from one of the top 10 business schools in the U.S. costs upwards of US$100,000. In Canada, the fees at many schools can be much lower but still substantial, ranging from about $10,000 to around $100,000, with the average being roughly in the middle. Those fees are inaccessible to a lot of people.

“Very few people have the opportunity to make the decision to attend a traditional MBA,” Mr. Gozalo says.

While the cost of a traditional MBA is a barrier for many people, ThePowerMBA is offered for around $1,400 (Canadian).

2. Do you really have to stop your life for it?

Another big challenge is finding the time to pursue a traditional MBA. Full-time studies mean stepping out of your career path for a year or more, and even part-time studies add at least an extra 15-to-20 hours to your already busy week.

“There is value in an MBA, just in terms of the skills that an MBA can provide,” says Mike Shekhtman, regional vice-president for B.C. and Manitoba at Robert Half International, a human resources consulting firm and corporate recruitment agency. “But it is a tremendous investment, not just monetary but also in time. It’s a tough decision for people to weigh, to just exit their current opportunity to complete a full-time MBA program.”

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Gozalo notes that ThePowerMBA offers micro-learning classes in a video format that can be consumed anytime, anywhere.

“You don’t have to stop your life for this. That’s extremely important,” Mr. Gozalo says.

Instead, the program can be completed in as little as 10 months while working.

3. Traditional MBAs can't keep up with the real world

The traditional model for an MBA relies on detailed case studies that take time to develop and incorporate into the curriculum.

“If you go to a traditional MBA program, the problem is you’re going to see cases that teach you about things that happened 15, 20 or 25 years ago,” Mr. Gozalo says.

Story continues below advertisement

“In business, things are changing extremely quickly. Things that were working even three years ago aren’t working any more… Our approach is to move as fast as the market, the knowledge, and the consumer are moving.”

ThePowerMBA’s online format lends itself to quick updates from real-life global business leaders like Marc Randolph, the co-founder and first CEO of Netflix, Daniel Lamarre, CEO of Cirque du Soleil and Sugarfina co-founder Rose O’Neill, to name just a few.

4. Should expertise be limited by lines on a map?

Most traditional business schools are limited by geography, and so are their students. Classes end up being taught by the professors who live within driving distance.

“But is that the way to learn from the best?” Mr. Gozalo asks. “Are those professors who are teaching in the thousands of business schools around the world the best teachers for that area or topic?”

ThePowerMBA looks around the world to bring the most compelling instructors and business minds to everyone, such as Eric Ries, creator of The Lean Startup Methodology, which has brought a lot of value to startups and businesses around the world.

Story continues below advertisement

The accessibility of global insights has attracted students worldwide to the program. To date, ThePowerMBA has signed up students from more than 60 countries.

5. Classroom learning is outdated, but nobody does anything about it.

In today’s busy and digital world, traditional classroom learning — listening to a lecture for hours at a time — is neither effective nor easily compatible with the lives of working professionals. ThePowerMBA offers lessons in tightly focused, 15-minute classes instead.

It’s not only more efficient, it’s also a better way to learn, Mr. Gozalo argues.

“Your brain is going to be focused,” he says. “If you spend one hour in front of a teacher, you’re only ever going to remember so much. But if you spend 10-to-15 minutes on highly curated content, talking about one topic each time with very specific examples, it’s proven that you’re not going to forget that.”

What’s next in business education?

Story continues below advertisement

Some professionals are looking to accelerate their career trajectory with part-time, rather than full-time MBA programs. While this does spread out the time commitment, it doesn’t remove barriers of cost or global accessibility.

Mr. Gonzalo says ThePowerMBA isn’t in competition with traditional MBA programs. Instead, it provides students with the relevant credentials they need to pursue or build their careers at home or in other parts of the world.

“Traditional MBAs will have always have their customers and they’re always going to have value for some people,” Mr. Gozalo says. “Our mission is democratizing top knowledge and bringing the main benefits of a traditional business school to anyone who wants to improve their business career and achieve their goals.”

More than 40,000 people worldwide have enrolled in or completed ThePowerMBA program to date. The global program has just launched with classes for the first cohort starting in September – and about 250 students in Canada have already signed up.

When you arrive at Canfield Estate after a picturesque jaunt along the country roads of rural Ontario, the first thing you’ll notice is the serenity. You can hear the birds chirping and the rustle of the leaves in the wind as the sounds and frenzy of city life slowly fade from your mind.

The estate, a one-of-kind private retreat, is on the market for an owner who is looking for natural beauty and a diverse range of amenities; from a games room and a cigar lounge, to a swimming hole and a ’50s-style diner outfitted with ice-cream makers, a popcorn machine and retro bar stools.

Located in the heart of Haldimand County, a 90-minute drive from Toronto, the sprawling 200-acre property includes 14 structures, including the stunning main lodge with five bedrooms and seven bathrooms, a versatile outdoor pavilion perfect for country dinners and four cottages for hosting friends and family for generations to come.

“It’s a place that people don’t want to leave,” says owner Blair McKeil, president and chief executive officer of Breakwater Investments. “Whether people arrive in a pick-up truck or helicopter, they want to stay longer. It’s a secluded sanctuary.”

Open this photo in gallery The common area, a combined living room, dining room and bar, is warm and welcoming. The overall design of the estate is rustic modern luxury. SUPPLIED

Once used as a hunting lodge, the extraordinary estate can serve as an all-year family estate, a corporate retreat, a countryside resort, or a rustic wedding venue.

It’s easy to see why it has become a beloved getaway for so many guests since it was built in 2012. In the summer, there are plenty of activities to fill in the gloriously long days: fly fishing, paddle boating, skeet shooting, swimming, following the bevy of swans as they paddle through the pond, dining at a 50-foot harvest table, enjoying drinks outdoors as the sun sets, and later, catching a movie at the on-site drive-in theatre with a 20- by 30-foot screen.

“Canfield Estate brings people together to share and care,” says McKeil. “It offers a sense of community where you can feel safe and secure, like a bird’s nest.”

Come fall, activities shift to hiking through the golden-leaved forest, more fishing in the fully stocked pond and roasting marshmallows under the bright stars of a clear night.

In winter, it’s time for skating on a frozen pond, a friendly game of hockey, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing or tobogganing. Pamper yourself with a steam in the sauna and then cozy up next to the fireplace with a good book and a bottle of wine from the cellar.

Meanwhile, in spring, as the first blooms of the season open in the meadows, sunlight streams through the large windows of the Great Hall and meals prepped in the industrial kitchen of the main lodge may feature early fresh produce, such as asparagus and rhubarb, picked up at nearby farms.

The overall look of Canfield Estate is rustic modern luxury that’s warm and welcoming. Every room of each building of the complex has been thoughtfully designed with comfort in mind. The talent of local artisans can be seen in the details of the décor – hammered copper sinks, a pair of canoes hung from the ceiling and turned into light fixtures, birch bark accents and photos on the wall from the archives of Hudson’s Bay.

Haldimand County is one of Canada’s most liveable communities, according to a 2019 report by Maclean’s. It’s home to a growing wine scene and a wide range of local producers, offering everything from fresh turkey to organic fruits and vegetables. The sandy shores of Lake Erie are just a 15-minute drive away, handy for boaters and fishermen.

Canfield Estate is much more than a large piece of property. It represents a lifestyle, a more leisurely pace and an appreciation for things that really matter, like spending quality time with family and enjoying the finer things in life in a private space that feels like it’s a world apart. As McKeil points out, “You can do so many wonderful things here that many people have never experienced. It’s a very special place.”

Many people are thinking about making changes to how and where they live these days, as working from home, a healthier lifestyle and more space become more important to them.

Norfolk County, a 90-minute drive from Toronto, is increasingly attracting new residents, both as part-time and full-time property owners. A large region best known for being on the shores of Lake Erie, the area encompasses charming lakeside towns like Port Dover, and stunningly beautiful parkland like the Long Point National Wildlife Area.

Cindy Pichette, broker of record for Gold Coast Real Estate, has lived in the county for more than 25 years. “I came here on a day trip over two decades ago and I fell in love with it,” she says. “I found a real sense of community – one where people really care about one another.”

Others looking for cottages or a new permanent residence are likely to discover that as well, plus so much more. For vacationers, Norfolk County is an ideal alternative to northern locales such as Muskoka, Haliburton and The Kawarthas.

“Things don’t close up here for the winter,” explains Pichette. “We’re an affordable, four-season destination. You can get lakeside properties for much less than you would in other places. And a short commute means you won’t be stuck in traffic for hours trying to get there.”

There are some great properties available for sale, she adds, whether you’re looking for a homey cottage or a family compound spacious enough to accommodate guests. Notable listings worth considering include:

Imagine dinners on a deck that stretches along the entire length of the home, which boasts almost 5,000-square-feet of living space with plenty of room to grow. Outside, the landscaping may remind you of Muskoka, but this area offers greater affordability for lakeside living without the crowds or the traffic, ideal for families and for those who desire a more leisurely pace of life, including sitting back with an ice-cold beverage and taking in the glorious sunsets.

“People come to Norfolk County for the lifestyle it offers,” says Pichette. “Those who are tired of big cities like the abundance of space, peace and security, and the ability to enjoy an active life.”

That could include birdwatching at Long Point (home to more than 400 species), boating, golfing, year-round fishing, walking on the beach, ziplining, festivals, farmers’ markets, biking and hiking on converted rail trails, and touring artisan studios. “Life here is reminiscent of a simpler time,” she adds. “I call it ‘small-town adorable.’”

Although the pre-pandemic allures of Toronto are not too far away, many people in this picturesque region can find everything they need locally, including topnotch food and drink options.

Norfolk County is also known as Ontario’s Garden; thanks to the sandy soil and longer growing season, it produces most of Ontario’s asparagus, tart cherries, strawberries, pumpkins and squash. For people who appreciate everything from craft beer to free-range eggs, homemade pies and field-fresh produce, it’s a foodie’s paradise. It’s also becoming more of a well-known wine region, with nine booming wineries and the popular “Toast the Coast” wine trail.

With that in mind, why not give yourself a treat and take a day or two to explore the possibilites.

They found their dream home in Toronto’s Don Mills area, Julian’s old stomping grounds, where he spent part of his childhood.

For Julian, 34, who, with his mother, sells real estate, moving into his old neighbourhood meant reacquainting himself with his community and childhood friends. For Amber, the trees, parks and friendly vibe reminded her of her childhood growing up in Kitchener, Ont.

Their three-bedroom, three-level, 1950s-style townhouse needed some work, but at $720,000, the price was right and the financial transition relatively easy because, unlike many young couples, they had skipped the renting stage and had been able to buy their condo, which had appreciated in value and built up equity that they could put to use.

“It gave us an opportunity to buy down the road,” says Amber, 36, a shopping marketing manager in the food and beverage industry.

The couple took ownership in the fall of 2018. In February of this year, their daughter Lucia was born.

“For all of Lucia’s life, we’ve been in lockdown,” says Amber. “Our home is like a sacred temple, away from the battleground outside.”

Although she can’t do the things she was looking forward to as a new mother — Mommy Mondays, swimming together, overnight stays with her parents in Kitchener — Amber says the extra bonding time they have had together as a family unit has been a blessing.

“Julian is my village,” she says. “He’s working from home, so he is able to help out with the baby. We’ve established a really nice, relaxed routine that would have been hard to do [otherwise].”

Part of the routine includes lots of cooking in the newly opened-up kitchen, as well as reading and gardening. They also renovated the basement and set up a gym soon after the pandemic restrictions came in.

“We have renovated a lot of the house since we moved in,” she says of the projects that total approximately $50,000 to date. “Every corner feels good because we put our blood, sweat and tears into it.”

Julian and Amber embarked on the buying process by enlisting a bank and a mortgage specialist. They’re grateful that their bank helped them to see the full picture.

“[The bank] was proactive and upfront about mortgage rates, taxes and lawyers’ fees,” Julian says.

Amber agrees. “That conversation is important to understand your debts and that you have to have enough for a down payment plus other expenses.”

Unfortunately, not all banks are created equal. Take the time to find a bank you’re comfortable with and that wants to do what’s best for you.

“That’s one of the advantages of working with HSBC,” says Matt Mercer, Head of the Mortgage Centre at HSBC Bank Canada in Toronto. “We are a bank with mortgage specialists that can help homeowners understand their financial situation and provide a mortgage that best suits their needs.”

For some, it’s a fixed rate. For others it’s variable, depending on how comfortable people are with where interest rates may go and the amount of flexibility they want with their mortgage, Matt says.

“When looking for a mortgage, it’s always a good idea to find someone who talks to you about your lifestyle and your future plans,” he says. “Mortgage specialists help you assess your situation and find the mortgage that is right for you.”

By having a full discussion, Matt says they can help you identify and account for lifestyle factors that you may not even have considered.

“Everyone’s situation is unique and that’s why it’s important to work with a mortgage specialist to understand your individual situation and a bank you know and trust.”

We’re loving [our home] now and updating it as we go. And one day, we can use the equity to buy a bigger place — as our family grows. JULIAN COMPTON

What advice do the couple have for new homeowners?

“It may sound basic,” Amber says, “but if you’re buying a house with someone, you need to figure out where you want to be. What if one wants to live in the east end and the other wants to be in the west? You have to agree on location from the start and get to know the market. And also figure out how you are going to pay bills. Who is responsible for what, like hydro, groceries, insurance?”

Next, seek out someone who is an expert in mortgages. “You might think you can afford a two-bedroom house, but in reality, it could be a one-bedroom condo, or conversely, you may be able to afford more than you think,” Julian says.

Finally, keep your goals in mind — including long-term.

The couple plan to use their townhome as a stepping-stone to a semi-detached when their five-year mortgage is over.

“We’re loving it now and updating it as we go,” Julian says. “And one day, we can use the equity to buy a bigger place — as our family grows.”

In the meantime, they are enjoying their new lives and community and strengthening their relationship as a new family.

We believe long-term investors should invest for the long haul and focus more on risks to their goals and less on shorter-term worries over volatility.","Investing in stocks in volatile markets isn’t easy. Uncertainty and volatility can shake the faith of even the most optimistic and experienced investors. Investors often react by changing their investment strategies to reduce portfolio volatility. Sometimes this can make sense. But keep in mind, volatility is just one of many investment risks. Risk is multi-faceted and there is almost always a trade-off. Minimizing volatility can expose you to other, potentially more profound, risks.

We believe current economic uncertainty and market volatility concerns present a good opportunity to re-evaluate risk and what it means for you and your portfolio, both in the short and long term. We have found that investors tend to focus on short-term risk, notably volatility. But if you shift your perspective and focus to the long term, risk often looks very different. For example, one big long-term risk is that your portfolio fails to deliver the growth you need to meet your goals. This often happens when people don’t have an appropriate asset allocation or portfolio strategy aligned with those goals. Or they fail to account for inflation or a long investment time horizon.

Investors tend to see short-term volatility as their biggest risk

Volatility is a measure of how much a security’s returns vary over time. A security with very low volatility will offer a relatively steady rate of return. More-volatile securities, however, have a greater dispersion of returns, as measured by standard deviation from their average. In simple terms, more-volatile securities tend to have bigger swings in price. Risk, on the other hand, is a much more expansive concept that includes all uncertainties.

There is a tendency, however, to pay more attention to risk that is right in front of you. And most commonly when investors refer to “risk,” they’re referring to short-term volatility—stock prices moving down over a few days or weeks. Watching your investment accounts drop can be harrowing, but—if you don’t need to draw from these savings in the short term—short-term volatility may not pose a big risk to your long-term goals.

For example, if your investment time horizon is 10, 20 or 30 years, then short-term ups and downs over a few days, weeks or even months shouldn’t be a huge concern. Human psychology, however, makes it hard for us to stomach even short-term declines. Myopic loss aversion, a key principle of behavioural economics, identified by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, holds that, “when directly compared or weighted against each other, losses loom larger than gains.”[i] This means we tend to find a loss more painful than we find a similar or even larger gain pleasurable. This can cause investors to go to great lengths to avoid losses, even if it means sacrificing future gains.

However, over the long term, risk is different. Whilst investors are often most concerned with short-term declines, one of the biggest risks over the long term is that your portfolio’s growth falls short of what you need to reach your goals. Given this risk, adjusting your portfolio to reduce volatility, shifting your asset allocation out of stocks too soon or trying to time the market can all be risky over the long term.

Straying from your optimal asset allocation is dangerous

Investors who need portfolio growth over longer time horizons typically own equities for their history of strong long-term growth. If you have determined you need to be substantially invested in stocks in order to reach your goals, it can be dangerous to react to short-term volatility by departing from that asset allocation. Why? The long-term annualised return of equities is 8%, whilst fixed interest has returned 6.1%.[ii] The difference between these two long-term annualised returns may seem minor and an acceptable trade-off for less stomach-churning volatility. But consider that a $500,000 portfolio invested for 20 years that grew 8% annually would have a final value of $2,330,479—whereas a similarly sized portfolio invested for 20 years that grew at 6% annually would have a final value of $1,603,568. A 2% difference compounded over 20 years can result in a sizable difference in final portfolio value. That’s why asset allocation decisions—and the discipline to adhere to a portfolio strategy—are so important.

Then, too, if you deviate from your target asset allocation by selling some or all of your equities, you’ll face a second perilous decision: When should you reinvest in equities? In a month? When the market calms down? When everything feels safe? Unfortunately, in the short term, the stock market is almost impossible to predict and any attempt at market timing may be riskier than a buy-and-hold strategy. Stock market returns are highly uneven and it’s not unusual to see big gains in just a few trading days. Given that missing a handful of these big “up” days can be costly, we believe it often makes more sense to stay invested in equities.

Lastly, it is important to remember that a stock market correction—a sharp, sudden drop of -10% to -20%—is often followed by a recovery that is just as sharp and sudden. To benefit from selling out of equities during a correction, your timing would need to be impeccable. You would need to sell some or all of your equities early enough to dodge a substantial portion of the downturn. And you would need to buy back in so as not to miss out on the rebound. We know of no investor consistently able to do so. If you sold out of stocks too late or bought back in too late, you may have ended up experiencing a good deal of the downside and missed out on a substantial portion of the recovery. We believe the takeaway is, if you try to time equity markets to avoid short-term declines, there is a great likelihood you do yourself more harm than good.

Short-term volatility is a risk. But depending on your investment time horizon, it may not be your biggest risk. Quite simply, for many investors, the biggest risk is failing to achieve the growth they need to meet their long-term goals. Moreover, focusing on short-term risks alone may mean ignoring or increasing your long-term risks. Though it may be tempting at times, deviating from your optimal long-term asset mix just to reduce short-term volatility can make it less likely that you achieve the growth necessary to reach your long-term goals. We believe long-term investors should invest for the long haul and focus more on risks to their goals and less on shorter-term worries over volatility.

It starts with a stock market slump. Concern escalates to worry as you watch the financial news describe the precipitous drop—and speculate on a worsening outlook. Worry becomes full-blown anxiety as volatile markets devolve into a larger downturn.

It’s normal to experience anxiety and unease during turbulent stock markets or in the depths of a bear market. And these feelings aren’t just in your head. A 2014 University of California, San Diego study suggests that daily fluctuations in stock prices can have an almost immediate impact on the health of investors. The study found sharp stock market price drops are accompanied by an increasing number of hospital visits over the following two days—especially for mental-health reasons.[i]

Besides the potential physical and psychological toll, financial anxiety can also cause investors to make emotionally driven mistakes that could imperil their long-term financial goals. However, there are positive steps you can take to help combat those stressful feelings and avoid making costly investing mistakes that could jeopardise your financial future.

Take a media break

The addictive ping of social media and the squawk of always-on news can be constant sources of anxiety during market downturns. It’s good to stay informed, but spending too much time subject to relentless market updates and binging on social media can be detrimental if you’re not able to find some distance and regain perspective on current events or your longer-term investing goals. Consider taking a break from the news and social media to help keep yourself on an even keel. Maybe limit yourself to a set amount of time per day or per week. Stay informed, but try not to fixate on day-to-day market movements. Watch out for sensationalism and opinion in the content you consume and compare them against verifiable facts. In particular, social-media platforms or online blogs can often harbour hastily written or poorly researched information from dubious sources. So keep your guard up to avoid investing tips from sources lacking ethics, expertise or both.

You can get a compound effect if you layer more positive behaviours on top of your media break. For example, when you feel the social-media spiral and the financial news pulling you down, spend some time outside, go on a walk, start a project or get some exercise to help you reset your frame of mind.

Find a way to feel in control financially

Anxiety often comes from a lack of a sense of control. You may feel like events are sweeping you up and you’re powerless to do anything. Even though market moves are outside your control, you’re far from powerless during market downturns. There are a number of actions that can help restore your sense of financial control and curb anxiety.

Get your financial house in order: Investments are only one part of your overall financial picture. Exert financial control where you can. If you don’t have a financial plan, sit down with everyone affected by your monthly budget to prioritise necessities. If you’ve already got a financial plan, revisit your budget and priorities to make sure you know where your money is going. Then consider trimming any excesses you find. To help your short- and medium-term finances, make sure you have—or are working towards—an emergency fund to cover at least three months of expenses. An emergency fund can help if you encounter unexpected expenses or lose a portion of your income.

Revisit your investing goals; rebalance your portfolio if necessary: If you’ve got a financial plan in place, but it’s been a while since you’ve reviewed your previous goals in light of recent life events, now might be a good time to revisit it. If you find your long-term goals have changed or your portfolio has strayed too far from its targeted asset allocation, you might need to rebalance to get back in line.

If you’ve got a financial plan in place, but it’s been a while since you’ve reviewed your previous goals in light of recent life events, now might be a good time to revisit it. If you find your long-term goals have changed or your portfolio has strayed too far from its targeted asset allocation, you might need to rebalance to get back in line. Reframe “doing nothing” as an active choice: When markets are pitchpoling, it can feel like you’re tumbling along with them. It’s common to feel like you need to do something—others may be selling out of the market and insisting you should too. However, those feelings could move you further away from your financial goals if you sell at the wrong time and then miss out on a subsequent rebound. So what can you do? Doing nothing may be a better option if you already have a prudent investing plan with an optimal asset allocation. This may not feel good in the moment, but you can mentally reframe it. Think of it as an active decision to continue along a path that will likely pay off if you’re able to remain disciplined over the long run.

Lean on a trusted adviser for help

Financial anxiety can make you feel as if you’re in over your head and you don’t know what to do. We believe the practices presented in this article can help you feel calmer and more in control. But remember, you don’t need to go it alone. Working with a trusted investment professional can serve as an outlet for your financial anxieties. If you don’t have a financial professional with whom you work regularly, now might be a time to find one. Think of an adviser as a financial counsellor who can help you stay on track with your financial plan as you navigate whatever challenges you’re facing.

Your money manager should help educate you about common investing biases, such as myopic loss aversion, which describes the human tendency to feel the pain from losses much more than we feel the joy from gains. This bias has led many investors to sell stocks low after a crash—only to miss out on subsequent gains whilst waiting to get back into the market. Having open and honest conversations with your financial professional can help you avoid making mistakes that could significantly decrease the likelihood of achieving your long-term financial goals. The more frank you are with your investment professional, the more he or she can help set you up for financial success. A good professional should consider the curiosities, hesitations, passions and fears you’ve discussed to personalise their service and help you gain more confidence in your plan.

Financial anxiety is a common problem. Using some of these techniques to help give yourself more control and comfort can be a great first step on the path to a better financial future.

Many governments around the world have approved large fiscal- and monetary-aid packages designed to alleviate the economic toll of COVID-19 containment measures. Much of this spending will likely be financed through government borrowing. Some investors worry increasing government debt will stifle future economic growth or otherwise lead to market ruin. However, even as governments wade deeper into “red ink” in their effort to support families and businesses, we at Fisher Investments don’t believe that rising government debt automatically portends looming economic or market catastrophe.

This article examines how the stock market has historically responded to different government-debt levels in the US. We’ll look primarily through the lens of the United States, which serves as an insightful example since it has a large amount of outstanding government debt, is the world’s biggest stock market by market capitalization, and issues the most widely traded government-debt securities—US Treasurys.[i]

The US has large (and getting larger) debt burden, but that’s not the whole story

Story continues below advertisement

Congress allocated nearly $2.8 trillion in emergency aid as of mid-May and gross US federal debt that isn’t held by the government itself (i.e. net public debt) is now around $19.6 trillion.[ii] The scale of the 2020 fiscal measures—both announced and planned—is indeed significant, but how does that compare to other government responses? As of May 15, 2020, China’s fiscal response amounts to around 1.2 trillion yuan ($169 billion), while Japan added a ¥17 trillion ($157 billion) aid package to a previously approved 2020 budget. Meanwhile, the UK’s spending measures total around £175 billion ($214 billion). These amounts vary widely, but when normalized by comparing against each country’s economic output, the range varies from China’s 1.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) to the U.S.’s 13%.[iii]

In the U.S., the result is a ballooning 2020 budget deficit, which causes some investor concern. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an updated 2020 budget forecast on 24 April, in which the CBO estimates the U.S. will spend about $3.7 trillion more than it receives in taxes during fiscal year 2020.[iv] That deficit is financed through U.S. Treasury debt, which adds to the U.S. net public debt load. These estimates are all subject to change and reality may differ, but if debt makes you nervous, those figures are likely anxiety-inducing.

It’s the ability to service debt, not absolute debt levels that counts

In our view, a government’s ability to make scheduled interest and principal payments—what the financial industry likes to call “servicing debt”—is the most important consideration to monitor. You’ll often see government-debt levels compared to GDP as an approximation of a country’s ability to afford its debt. The idea is to compare what a country owes to what it generates in a single year—similar to how you’d compare a household’s debt to its income. However, we think focusing on absolute debt levels compared to GDP can be misleading. A country accumulates debt over decades, but GDP is an annual flow of economic activity, making this a useful but imperfect measure of affordability.

Ultimately, governments pay their creditors with revenue generated from taxes, so we believe a better way to evaluate a country’s ability to handle its current debt load is net interest costs as a percentage of tax revenue. By historical standards, U.S. government debt today appears very affordable. In 2019, interest payments’ share of tax revenue was lower than it was during most of the 1980s and 1990s. And those were overall great periods for U.S. stocks. Even with expected debt-level increases and tax-revenue declines this year and next, we believe U.S. debt should remain affordable.

Lower interest rates and longer maturities take off some additional pressure

Story continues below advertisement

There are a number of other factors that can affect a country’s ability to afford its debt. First, there’s the debt servicing cost, which is determined by interest rates. Historically low-interest rates around the world (and governments tend to enjoy some of the lowest rates) have kept borrowing costs low for many years. Additionally, with government bond yields at historic lows (and in some regions, actually negative), newly issued debt should take advantage of these low rates and relatively cheaper debt financing.

A second factor that affects the affordability of government debt is its maturity or the length of time for which the money is being borrowed. When government debt matures and the principal amount must be repaid, many governments, including that of the U.S., issue new debt to pay off the old. Refinancing at currently low rates means older, more-expensive debt can be replaced with newer, less-expensive debt. For example, since 2009, the U.S. Treasury has increased the average maturity of outstanding U.S. debt from less than 50 months to 69.2 months, as of the end of March 2020—effectively locking in lower rates for longer.[i] Similarly, the UK government has also been actively increasing the average maturity of its debt—known as gilts—which now sits at around 15.3 years.[ii] In either case, we believe interest rates would likely have to materially rise and stay elevated for years in order to significantly increase overall debt servicing costs in the US or UK.

A few final thoughts

In our view, stock markets typically price in information relevant for how the world will look between about 3 and 30 months from the present time. The long-term nature of government-debt obligations tends to fall outside of that window, blunting the impact to markets. Plus, while recently passed spending and aid packages are big, remember that they aren’t all permanent balance-sheet entries, and they may not cost as much as originally estimated. For example, in the U.S., $454 billion of the Federal Reserve’s monetary efforts backstops loans to small businesses. To the extent these loans are repaid, that money could be recouped. The Fed will also return interest on those loans to the Treasury, as it does all of its profits, further defraying the cost. Another $211 billion relief measure is deferred—but not canceled—employer payroll taxes. Finally, this increased spending is likely a one-time splurge, not a new, permanently higher spending plateau. Following the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent stimulus and bailout efforts, the U.S. budget deficit initially soared in 2009 but then fell for six straight years. So while the amounts may boggle the mind, we don’t believe government debt is signaling stock market ruin.

ZEW equity market sentiment index for the eurozone, August 2000 and February 2020.","Whilst every equity bear market (a fundamentally driven decline exceeding -20% from a prior high) has different specific circumstances and details, we think many of them—including the current one—have some commonalities. An important one, we think, is how sentiment evolves during a bear. Magnitudes, causes and durations vary—which may make bear markets seem bewildering. But in our experience, how people react emotionally to a bear is timeless.

For bull markets—periods of overall rising equity prices—we think legendary investor Sir John Templeton described sentiment’s path best: “Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on scepticism, mature on optimism and die on euphoria.” But this only takes you through market sentiment on the way up. For the other side of Templeton’s quote, Fisher Investments’ Founder, Executive Chairman & Co-Chief Investment Officer Ken Fisher reframed Templeton’s depiction: “Bear markets are born on euphoria, grow on grinding economics, mature on recession and die on panic.” This generally shows the development of bear markets, which are typically joined shortly thereafter by a period of broad-based economic contraction (a recession).

Now, 2020’s bear market didn’t follow this blueprint early on. It is fair to say sentiment wasn’t universally euphoric at the global equity market’s February peak, in our view. The ZEW sentiment index for eurozone equities was moderately positive in February at 21.6 (above zero is optimistic), but it was nowhere close to its 79.4 record high in 2000.[i] In the US, over 41% of investors were bullish, according to the American Association of Individual Investors’ survey, just above its average since 1987.[ii] Moreover, the economy didn’t begin contracting gradually this time—production suddenly stopped as COVID-19-related responses closed businesses, which halted growth.

The bear market’s unprecedented speed compressed the sentiment cycle, in our view. The MSCI World Index’s high was on 12 February, a couple weeks before shutdowns in Europe began.[iii] Then, reality still seemed sunny to us and many observers we follow. In late January, the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook projected global growth accelerating to 3.3% in 2020.[iv] Sentiment may have been optimistic, but it appeared justified and rational to us. Absent COVID-19’s global spread and the associated interruptions to business, that optimism may have eventually become euphoric. But the surprising institutional response to shut down business around the world cut the sentiment cycle’s progression short, in our view. Growing outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran brought rising alarm. Italy’s first case was announced on 20 February. But a full lockdown didn’t occur until 10 March. Business closures—for weeks, if not months—erased hope economic activity might avoid a big collapse.

A global recession looks increasingly likely from the early data rolling in. Whilst we think employment data are a lagging indicator, 17 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in March’s last three weeks.[v] Before this, there had never been a week above 700,000 in the series’ 53-year history.[vi] The eurozone composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI), combining manufacturing and services, plunged to 29.7 in March—well below the 50 level, which indicates contraction—in its biggest ever single-month drop.[vii] For the world, March’s global composite PMI fell to 39.4, its lowest level in 11 years.[viii]

Judging by financial publications we follow regularly, few would likely be surprised by recession—as sentiment seemingly reflects the bear market maturing. Forecasters from major financial firms project huge drops in Q2 gross domestic product (GDP, a government-produced measure of economic output) for most major economies. In early April, the IMF warned GDP could fall more than during the recession that accompanied 2008’s global financial crisis. Comparisons we read in the press go further. Many headlines we encounter suggest we are on the verge of another Great Depression—modern history’s biggest economic contraction on record. Many pundits we see argue the recovery, whenever it comes, will be hamstrung by high unemployment, business failures and rising government debt. To us, the mood appears rather panicky.

It isn’t clear if current sentiment marks the bear’s end. We think it will be clear only in hindsight, but the fear and panic we see isn’t unusual. We think markets, which efficiently discount widely known information, likely reflect that panic. A reality that doesn’t meet or exceed that should positively surprise investors. That is how, as Templeton put it, “Bull markets are born on pessimism.”

Whilst the current bear market is unique in its shocking speed, sentiment’s evolution to apparent panic suggests it may progress to a conclusion swiftly. Sentiment is unpredictable—and could always go lower—but the further it stretches expectations downward from likely outcomes, the easier it is for reality to positively surprise, in our view.

Think you’re smarter than average? Whilst this is mathematically true for only around half the population, we think most people would likely answer ‘yes.’ Regardless of whether you happen to be smarter than average, this sort of statistical impossibility is one example of people generally overestimating their abilities and skills—also known as overconfidence. Confidence can be a good thing but, in investing, overconfidence can lead to critical errors that may seriously hurt your chances at a comfortable retirement. Here we’ll explore where this bias comes from, some of the other cognitive errors that often accompany it, and why it can be one of the biggest factors standing between investors and their goals.

The Origins of Overconfidence

Overconfidence likely stems from behaviours that provided humans an advantage in the past. In hunter-gatherer societies, overconfidence may have been an evolutionary necessity—when the average work day involves chasing down an animal five times your size for dinner, it’s hard to be too confident. But modern life and investing are very different, and giving in to overconfidence these days can warp our investing habits for the worse.

Story continues below advertisement

Unfortunately, many other human tendencies contribute to overconfidence, making it a potentially powerful bias that’s difficult to overcome. For instance, we may naturally accumulate pride about our skills and accomplishments. In investing, pride accumulation occurs when investors attribute investing successes to what they believe are their skills, potentially ignoring the true underlying reasons (or even luck) that may have been involved. On the other side of that coin is regret shunning, which occurs when investors attribute their investing failures to outside forces instead of acknowledging personal mistakes and limitations.

Confirmation bias is another natural inclination that can feed into overconfidence and further wreak havoc on our decisions. Confirmation bias leads us to only pay attention to evidence that supports our pre-existing beliefs. We can see this in many aspects of life. Unless you love to argue, you probably spend more time with people who generally share your beliefs than with people who contradict your ideas at every opportunity. Similarly, most of us tune in to news sources that generally express our political beliefs. When investing, if you limit yourself to information that validates your existing beliefs, you’re essentially creating blind spots in your strategy. Markets are complex and dynamic. If you narrow your focus too much, you’re increasing the likelihood you miss something important that may impact your investments.

Another common error, hindsight bias, is also closely tied to pride accumulation and regret shunning. Hindsight bias is the feeling of ‘I knew it all along!’—even if that wasn’t the case. We have a tendency to remember the more prescient thoughts we had in advance of an eventual event and disregard the conflicting thoughts we had at the same time. For example, leading up to the 2008 global financial crisis, do you remember feeling a financial downturn was imminent? Were you concerned about the real estate market in the United States and subprime mortgages, and expected those concerns would impact equity markets? Now, if you did have these concerns, did you act on them? We’ve encountered many investors who say the downturn was obvious at the time, but still participated in the declines—classic hindsight bias. Inaccurately remembering past judgments like this can lead us to overestimate our future ability.

The Consequences of Overconfidence

Overconfidence—in conjunction with confirmation bias, hindsight bias and other cognitive errors—can lead to many poor investing choices that can significantly impact your financial future. Overconfident investors may overestimate their investment-picking ability, which can lead to making big bets and taking big risks.

For instance, have you ever bought into a ‘hot’ initial public offering or a potentially risky security because you remember past securities you ‘knew’ would do well before they surged? Was your choice based on careful, thorough, impartial analysis? Because hindsight could be a factor, and if that leads you to make a big, risky investment, you could be taking on more risk than you should due to bias.

Owning too few equities is another potentially damaging strategy to which overconfident investors may fall victim. If you own just a handful of individual equities in your portfolio, you’re likely making large, risky bets. Investing in equities always carries the risk of loss—no matter your confidence level. However, you can lower your individual security risk by diversifying your portfolio with at least a few dozen equities from various industries and geographies. An extreme case of this error occurs when investors hold their own employer’s shares as a large portion of their investment portfolio. You may think you work for a great company, but virtually no one but the most senior executives truly knows the direction of the company, and sometimes even they don’t know an equity-tanking scandal is about to unfold.

Consider the case of Enron employees in the 2000s—those who invested in Enron’s shares in their retirement plans not only lost their jobs when the company folded, but also lost their retirement savings. Workers for Parmalat in Italy or Swissair in Switzerland may have encountered similar situations if they decided to hold large investments in their company’s shares prior to the company’s equity losing its value.

Avoiding Overconfidence

How can you avoid making these mistakes? Given all the various ways investors can fall prey to overconfidence, it may seem overwhelming. But you can take several steps to help stay humble and prudent when investing.

To begin, flip your natural tendencies on their heads by shunning pride and accumulating regret. You can always be wrong in your investing choices—even the most legendary investors don’t get it right all of the time. In fact, if you were right just 70% of the time over the long term, you would likely be an investing legend. Look for opportunities to recognise your mistakes and take responsibility for them. Revel in them a while. Learn from them. And remember, not all of your past investing successes can be attributed to your own skill—luck is often a factor. For proof, consider keeping a journal of your investing thoughts and comparing how often they actually aligned with market performance. Revisit it often—how frequently were your thoughts or predictions actually aligned with real market movement? If you made a market decision, check to see if it made you worse or better off. Even if you did well, did you actually outperform relative to other similar investments? If you are able to learn from the times you were mistaken, you may have a better chance of avoiding similar mistakes in the future.

You can also consider using a trusted financial adviser or coach to help you stay on the path towards your goals. Avoiding common investing mistakes can be difficult, especially when working on your own. An adviser may be able to help provide an impartial perspective and investing expertise. Finally, study markets as much as possible. But be wary as you gather your information and don’t forget the impact of confirmation bias. Do your best to seek out multiple sources of information, including those that may present opposing beliefs or viewpoints from your own.

Although you can never be fully rid of biases, you can be more aware of them and know how to minimise their impacts on your investing decisions. Whilst behavioural biases apply to many aspects of life, making financial mistakes because of them can have far-reaching consequences. They may actually hinder your ability to retire or live the comfortable retirement you’ve been working towards. So don’t forget to check your biases at the door when you start investing—and continue to re-evaluate them every day.

With public health measures easing in most provinces and many businesses reopening amid the pandemic, Canadians are eager to hit the road and leave lockdown life in the rearview mirror.

Non-essential travel outside of Canada is not an option for most Canadians, making ‘staycations’ a renewed trend. Thankfully, there’s no shortage of places to go and things to do within our borders.

From the surf beaches of Tofino, B.C. to the sweeping coastal views of Cape Spear, Nfld., Canada is a massive backyard full of adventure. There’s a dream trip within driving distance from most dots on a Canadian map.

Not sure where to go first? Here are three hidden gems to consider just outside of some of Canada’s largest cities, from east to west:

Hit the beach outside of Halifax

The sand-and-cobblestone shore of Lawrencetown Beach Provincial Park, about 30 km east of Halifax, is popular with surfers and beachcombers alike. The beach is part of the Cole-Harbour-Lawrencetown Coastal Heritage Park system, offering stunning vistas along vast stretches of walking trails that are part of the Trans Canada Trail network. Several surf schools offer lessons and there are supervised swimming areas during summer.

Travel beyond Toronto

Petroglyphs Provincial Park, about 200 km northeast of Toronto, is home to the largest known site of Indigenous rock carvings in Canada. “Teaching Rocks,” some of which are about 1,000 years old, depict the natural world and wildlife as told by the Nishnaabe people. At the visitor’s centre, interpretive guides tell Indigenous stories of the region. The park is also home to McGinnis Lake, a rare meromictic lake, meaning the layers of water don’t intermix. The park has scenic walking trails and serene picnic spots, so bring your lunch.

Vacation just outside of Vancouver

Just a short drive north and a 20-minute ferry ride from Vancouver, Bowen Island is a pastoral retreat hidden in Howe Sound. A haven of quaint galleries and coffee shops, the largely residential island also has a host of spa and wellness offerings and ample shopping and restaurants. For a small island, Bowen offers big nature. Kayaking, paddle-boarding, hiking and biking are just a few of the outdoor experiences available. There’s even a golf course. Crippen Regional Park has well-maintained trails and the 10-km hike up Mount Gardner rewards the adventurous with a glorious panoramic view from the Sunshine Coast to Vancouver Island.

Be prepared for the ride

The key to any good road trip is readiness. Don’t miss out on making lifelong memories due to nausea or the unexpected. Map your route, check the weather and pack appropriate clothing. Remember to travel in small groups and keep physical distance from others. Pack hand sanitizer and wash your hands regularly.

Make a loose itinerary of must-stops and maybe-stops. Bring plenty of water, as well as some snacks, and double check you have a basic first aid kit in the car. And make sure you have Gravol in the glove compartment and in your purse or backpack so nausea doesn’t ruin your trip.

Gravol offers effective relief of nausea, vomiting and dizziness due motion sickness to ensure your road trip remains uninterrupted. Gravol is available in an Immediate Release and Long Acting caplet that provides up to 12 hours of nausea relief. If you are travelling with little ones, Gravol Kids offers great-tasting and convenient chewable tablets. For those who are looking for a natural option, Gravol Ginger is made with certified organic ginger for non-drowsy relief from nausea and upset stomach.

Whether you’re a couple looking for a quiet getaway or a family seeking kid-friendly fun, now is the time to take a road trip.

A little planning can go a long way to making your vacation go smoothly. Here are a few tips:

Story continues below advertisement

Plan ahead

The first step in planning a road trip is shopping for essentials that will leave you prepared for your journey’s many twists and turns. Don’t forget a first-aid kit that includes items such as bandages, hand sanitizer and Gravol. You don’t want nausea or upset stomachs to put a damper on your road trip.

Gravol offers effective relief of nausea, vomiting and dizziness due motion sickness to make sure your road trip remains uninterrupted. Gravol is available in an Immediate Release and Long Acting caplet that provides up to 12 hours of nausea relief. If you are travelling with little ones, Gravol Kids offers great-tasting and convenient chewable tablets. For those who are looking for a natural option, Gravol Ginger is made with certified organic ginger for non-drowsy relief from nausea and upset stomach.

And while the open road beckons, it’s best to leave with a route in mind.

Many provincial and regional tourism agencies have suggestions for driving tours, with all of the activities and adventures mapped out.

If you have a destination in mind, a quick online search of the route may uncover some unexpected stops along the way that will make the drive even more worthwhile.

If you’re travelling with children, some of the magic can be found in the little stops along the way. At the very least, it helps to cut down on the number of times the kids ask ‘are we there yet?’

If you’re travelling with older children or teens, it’s good to involve them in the trip planning, so they have stops that pique their interest.

Story continues below advertisement

And while planning is good, so is the freedom to expect the unexpected. It’s okay to change plans midway when a new opportunity arises.

Be ride-ready

It’s a good idea to take your vehicle in for a check-up a few weeks ahead of your trip. Have the oil changed, check the fluid levels, get the battery tested and the tires inspected.

You do not want to have to pull over on the side of the road.

Make sure you have a spare set of keys that one of your co-pilots can carry in their purse or backpack, if yours get lost.

Also, take an inventory of the emergency supplies in your vehicle. Make sure you have a flashlight with extra batteries, a basic tool kit with a wrench and jumper cables, emergency flares or reflectors and extra windshield washer fluid.

Pack right

When packing for your trip, don’t forget to keep Gravol handy in your glove box to make sure you and your family have a nausea-free road trip!

Bring a cooler for drinks and snacks on the road, especially if you’re travelling with kids whose food cravings can be unexpected.

It’s also wise to check the weather reports and pack appropriate clothing for cool or rainy days.

Driving time is a great opportunity for some family fun. Pack card games and activities for kids and download some podcasts for times when you want everyone to sit still and listen.

Or, consider making a family playlist: Turn up the volume, and hit the road.

When considering what to do to stay cool during what has been one of the hottest summers on record, Canada’s largest freshwater outdoor swimming pool at the family-friendly St. Marys Quarry may be your best bet.

A two-hour drive westward from Toronto to the town of St. Marys, Ont., gets you to a place where you can slip into water that’s deep and deliciously crisp, curl your toes on a cliff jumping ramp that’s safe for kids or laze in the shade on the grass while soaking in the leafy scenery.

“It really is a gem,” says Town of St. Marys aquatic director Andrea Slade. “Our swims have been at capacity most days and we’ve been getting beautiful weather.”

The limestone quarry’s history as a hot spot for summer seekers wanting to take a cool splash stretches all the way back to the early 1930s. Some 20 years later, the municipality was running it as a public swimming facility, and today it continues to attract locals as well as tourists who take day trips to the town or stay for an overnight or two.

Nowadays, the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the town to put measures and precautions in place to ensure everyone who visits the quarry is safe. The town works with Huron Perth Public Health to consistently assess the situation and adapt its response. For example, you are required to wear a mask when entering the quarry and while using washrooms.

“People will find the experience is a bit different this summer with our protocols, but we’ve found everyone has been amazing,” Slade says. “We’ve had nothing but positive feedback from our swimmers.”

The biggest change from last year starts right at the beginning of the quarry experience.

To ensure physical distancing and help with contact tracing, you need to register and pay for your swim online. You can make your booking on the town website (townofstmarys.com). It’s worth checking the website for updates, too, before you go.

When you get to the quarry, you must show the receipt you were emailed when you registered for your swim. There is free parking right across the street.

The quarry is allowing 70 people in for each swim to meet physical distancing requirements, which has reduced the quarry capacity by 75 per cent, Slade says.

“We want to ensure that everyone is safe.”

There are three swims a day, seven days a week until the quarry closes for the season on Sept. 7. The daily swim times are posted on the website.

“Though our change room and washrooms are open, we’re suggesting that you arrive at the quarry with your swimsuit on,” Slade says. Due to physical distancing, only five people are allowed in the change rooms at a time.

Follow directional arrows to the grassy area at the quarry and you are asked to practise physical distancing by at least two metres between yourself and others.

Aside from the procedures to help protect visitors to the quarry during the pandemic, swimming safety is top of mind, too.

Water depths at the quarry run from three to 10 metres. You must be at least eight years old to use the cliff jump. Children aged 11 years and older who can complete a swim test can be admitted unaccompanied by a parent or guardian.

“We can supply a life jacket at no cost, but you can bring your own if you want,” Slade says.

“You might also want to bring a lawn chair or blanket for the grassy area.”

The canteen is closed this year, so you’re encouraged to bring your own non-alcoholic drinks and snacks.

In addition to the quarry, St. Marys offers scenic streets, parks and trails for walking, running and biking, including the two-kilometre Grand Trunk Trail walkway, a trestle bridge that is a former CN rail line.

The Sarnia Bridge affords a panoramic view of the town and countryside.

“The trestle bridge is one of my favourite sites to visit and it’s a great way to take in the entire town,” Slade says.

More options to cool off within a few hours’ drive

The Thousand Islands Region, about a three-hour drive east of Toronto, has a number of swimming spots. The beaches in the area are on some of the most iconic waterways in Ontario, including the mighty St. Lawrence River and the spectacular Rideau Canal.

Joel Stone Park is perfect for families as it has a wonderful sandy beach right on the St. Lawrence River. There are washrooms and change rooms, and the park includes a splash pad for children. The beach itself has a dock for people to jump from for deeper water and a wheelchair accessible ramp, so everyone is able to enjoy a day at the beach.

Kendrick’s Park is a great spot to bring the family for a day at the beach in Lyndhurst, Ont. There is a small fee for those visiting from outside the township, but it features many amenities such as barbecues and covered pavilions. A sandy beach with shallow waters is ideal for young children.

Gray’s Beach is located just about a two-minute drive from Gananoque on the Thousand Islands Parkway. The park is free of charge and features a small sand beach and some picnic tables for those looking to enjoy their lunch along the river.

Halstead’s Bay is farther down the parkway across from the Landon Bay Centre, part of the Thousand Islands National Park. This swimming spot features a natural sloping rock entrance to the water and ample parking for visitors. It’s a popular place to go after hiking along the many trails in the Landon Bay Centre across the road.

Brown’s Bay is located near Mallorytown along the Thousand Islands Parkway. The park offers ample picnic tables, a large sandy beach and even boasts views of Singer Castle out in the river. Brown’s Bay is typically open until the beginning of September.

Foley Mountain Conservation Area is the perfect stop along the Rideau Canal in Westport. It features a natural swimming area with a sandy beach, picnic tables and some barbecues so that you’re able to make the most of your beach day.

Niagara Falls, Ont., located between Lake Erie to the south and Lake Ontario to the north, is a drive of just over an hour south from Toronto. This famous tourist destination offers many options for some splashy fun, including:

A rooftop pool at the Sheraton Hotel with incredible views of the Falls;

Oversized, themed splashpads at Safari Niagara and Marineland;

Waterslides and wave pools at Fallsview Waterpark and Waves Indoor Waterpark.

Summer is a short season in Canada. Why not pack the car and head out for a wet and wild day trip or overnight stay?

In mid-July, the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto announced it was reopening its doors after being shut down for months because of the pandemic.

The hall has now reduced its capacity by 70 per cent and is providing personal protective equipment (PPE) for guests and employees.

For a hockey nation, that was a significant announcement, even symbolically, after months of cancellations of pro leagues, and amateur and local sports around the world. Pro sports leagues have slowly begun to resume play, although stadiums and arenas remain shuttered to fans.

However, there are plenty of options across the province for people needing to get out of their homes after months of self-isolation to help fill that sports void.

Sports halls and museums, golf courses, tennis courts, bike and jogging paths, softball fields and more are opening up, albeit with varying restrictions to help stop the spread of the virus.

“We are starting to have lots of families coming now, with kids,” says Scott Crawford, director of operations at the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, located in St. Marys, Ont., which is about 170 kilometres southwest of Toronto.

The hall is on a 32-acre site that celebrates Canada’s deep connection to the game, and includes the Harry Simmons Memorial Library, four baseball fields and walking trails. There are currently 133 inductees in the Hall of Fame, ranging from World Series-winning players to grassroots pioneers.

The hall, which opened in 1998, is in St. Marys for a reason – the first recorded game of baseball was held in nearby Beachville on June 4, 1838.

Open this photo in gallery Avid golfers can tee up on hundreds of courses across the province, including the London Forest City National Golf Club in London, Ont. TOURISM LONDON

Crawford says all the safety protocols are in place: A smaller number of people are allowed in the building, social distancing is being observed, masks are mandated, arrows and markers are on the floors, and thorough cleanings are done by staff throughout the day.

With the United States border closed, Crawford says they are counting on more people travelling to the hall from across the province and there is plenty to do for non-baseball fans as well. Visitors can enjoy more than 13 kilometres of walking and cycling trails, as well as swim, canoe, kayak, paddle board and play golf.

“It’s a good way to get out and have a fun day,” he says.

Avid golfers might also want to take a trip to Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ont., says Chamber of Commerce president Eduardo Lafforgue. The Niagara-on-the-Lake Golf Club, North America’s oldest golf course, is located right on Front Street within walking distance to the main street of downtown. It’s a rarity to find a golf course that close to downtown hotels and restaurants.

“The fact that you can play and see the old houses, the lake, these huge maple trees is unique and special,” Lafforgue says.

Another popular summertime activity, Lafforgue says, is bike riding from the downtown to the wineries in the area for tastings on the winery patios. In the nearby Niagara Falls region, cyclists have 56 kilometres of bike trails along the Niagara Parkway on which to ride.

Niagara Falls also boasts two of the best golf courses in the country – Legends on the Niagara and the Whirlpool Golf Course.

In picturesque London, Ont., golfers have a number of courses to choose from, says Natalie Wakabayashi, director of culture and entertainment tourism at Tourism London and an avid golfer herself. A favourite among locals is Thames Valley Golf Club, which is situated along the Thames River and just 10 minutes from downtown. Other popular courses include FireRock Golf Club in nearby Komoka, Ont., and the Forest City National Golf Club.

“There is a great selection of courses here, with picturesque holes along the river and lake,” Wakabayashi says. Hiking, biking and walking trails are other popular reasons why sports enthusiasts come to the city.

The Central Counties region of the province – which encompasses the Headwaters, York and Durham regions – is another popular spot for both seasoned and beginner golfers.

Mayfield Golf Club in Caledon East, Ont., offers a selection of programs for the increasing number of people who want to learn the game, says Susan Boyle, director of tourism for Central Counties Tourism. There you can learn about golf etiquette, basic biomechanics to help play the game and ways to improve your short game, which is key to scoring well.

Other destinations that will tempt golfers to toss the clubs into the back of the car and make the drive to Central Counties are such world-class courses as Angus Glen north of Toronto in Markham, Ont., and Wooden Sticks and Royal Ashburn in Durham Region.

Ontarians have so much available in their own backyard for active pursuits after months of lockdown. Grace Sammut, executive director of Resorts of Ontario, says that with the announcement that most regions of the province have moved to Stage 3, which allows for more places to reopen and larger gatherings of people, more sports activities are now available, such as tennis, volleyball and basketball.

Summer has always been a favourite season for Canadians, and after months of being cooped up because of the pandemic, people are eager to get outdoors and get active. Vacations farther afield still aren’t possible so there’s no reason to not make this summer the one in which to explore more immediate surroundings

“Ontario is made for adventure,” Sammut says.

“It is really all right here, a short drive away. Sports fans can get as active as they wish in resort country.”

With the pandemic still raging worldwide, Ontarians looking to travel this summer are focusing more on road trips within their own home province.

Whether you and your family are hopping in the car, or the RV, there are several precautions to keep in mind to ensure road trip travel is as safe and stress-free as possible.

Here are some best practices, according to CAA South Central Ontario.

Story continues below advertisement

Plan properly

When looking for places to stay, search for hotels with free or flexible cancellation policies. Check the website of your destination, or call them, for updates on COVID-related closures or restrictions in the area. Get educated before you leave on safety-related requirements and guidelines such as mask usage, distancing, elevator usage and seating for wherever you are going so there are no surprises.

Check health updates

Stay tuned to the news for COVID-19 public health updates for the areas you are planning to visit.

Pack your own PPE

Bring plenty of masks, gloves, disinfectant wipes, paper towels and cleaning supplies for both you and your vehicle.

Pack extra snacks

Don’t assume there will be restaurant stops or convenience stores along the route. If there are restaurants that are open, they may have reduced capacity. Bring along a picnic lunch or snacks on the go.

Plan for washroom breaks

“Check where restrooms are open” along the way, says Niagara-on-the-Lake Chamber of Commerce president Eduardo Lafforgue, who has many tourists driving in from considerable distances. “This is important to consider, especially if you are travelling with children.”

Make a reservation

If your plan is to stop at a restaurant along the way, call ahead to make sure they are open, and make a reservation to hold your spot.

Wipe down your table

If you and your family choose to eat in a restaurant, bring along those disinfectant wipes and clean off the table and chairs. Use hand sanitizer after interacting with servers and cashiers.

Story continues below advertisement

Use gloves in the restroom

If you need to use a restroom along the way, try to touch as few surfaces as you can and use gloves, paper towel or even a plastic sandwich bag as a barrier between such surfaces as taps and doorknobs and your skin.

Bring the supplies you need

Try to bring as much as you think you might need to avoid contact with surfaces, such as towels, blankets and life jackets if you have them.

Prep your vehicle

You want to make sure vehicle is in top form to avoid any surprises on the way. Check the headlights, brake lights and turn signals to ensure they are operating properly. Make sure the oil and fluids are topped up. Check your tire pressure, clean the windshield and replace worn wiper blades, and make sure the car battery is strong. Thoroughly sanitize all surfaces you touch in your vehicle before and after your trip.

The more prepared you are, the more safe you’ll feel.

“That means you will better enjoy the experience of the trip you are taking,” says Natalie Wakabayashi, director of culture and entertainment tourism at Tourism London.

Bruce Cockburn and jazz singer Holly Cole are some of the Canadians icons headlining the schedule for the Royal Conservatory of Music this fall and winter and both are artists who have enjoyed national and international acclaim.

The Royal Conservatory, a “music education institution” founded on the principle that personal growth is channelled through the arts, has alumni of such renowned names as Oscar Peterson, Glenn Gould, Sarah McLachlan, Diana Krall, Gordon Lightfoot, k.d. lang and Cockburn.

Mervon Mehta, executive director of performing arts at The Royal Conservatory, says blending in Canadian icons is vital to their programming since they opened Koerner Hall 10 years ago. The venue showcases top-flight artists from across the jazz, classical, world music, folk and pop genres.

“Quite naturally, many have been Canadian,” Mehta says. This season the Royal Conservatory has 100 concerts and 51 of those feature Canadian artists.

That tells you everything about the demand. Canadian audiences take pride in Canadian artistic talent, but won’t go just because it’s the patriotic thing to do.

“Canadian musicians can go toe-to-toe with musicians from around the world in any genre,” Mehta says. “We proudly present them without caveat and without quotas. We also love to introduce our audiences to newer artists who we think show promise and need a larger platform.”

Of the Canadian headliners for the coming season three are already sold out (Cockburn, Cole and Adrianne Pieczonka) and several others are close (Karina Gauvin, Toronto Sings the Breithaupt Brothers, Amici Ensemble with Russell Braun, Louis Lortie, Oscar Peterson’s Africa, Angela Hewitt and Jan Lisiecki).

Cockburn plays Oct. 19 and Cole plays Dec. 14.

In Brampton, the Rose Theatre has a lineup this fall featuring Canadian legend Burton Cummings, rock quartet Sloan and a tribute to the late, great Gord Downie of The Tragically Hip.

Formed in Halifax in 1991, Sloan, now based in Toronto, just released its 12th studio album. A CBC Critics’ Poll had the Juno Award-winning band as one of Canada’s top bands of all time. Sloan plays on Oct. 10.

Story continues below advertisement

It’s been almost two years since Downie, the former frontman of The Tragically Hip, died, and Canada lost one of its true music icons. One of his legacies was his work on the reconciliation with Canada’s First Peoples.

The tribute concert at The Rose on Oct. 16 will feature a group of Canadian artists, in collaboration with The Gord Downie & Chanie Wenjack Fund, promoting awareness and education about the issue and celebrating Downie, his music and legacy. (Gord’s Legacy will also be performed on Oct. 18 at First Ontario Performing Arts Centre and at the Burlington Performing Arts Centre on Oct. 17.)

Cummings needs no introduction – the legendary singer, songwriter and recording artist was with Canada’s original rock ‘n’ roll superstars, The Guess Who, and then followed that with a long solo career featuring dozens of hit singles and albums. His Up Close and Alone show runs at The Rose on Nov. 28.

There is no shortage of Canadian talent around the province this fall and winter. Other notable concerts include: award-winning Canadian singer-songwriter Loreena McKennitt at Roy Thomson Hall on Nov. 1; Avril Lavigne plays TO Live’s Meridian Hall (formerly the Sony Centre) on Oct. 6; Jann Arden plays Casino Rama Resort on Dec. 7; Celine Dion is at Scotiabank Theatre on Dec. 9; and Blue Rodeo is at the Barrie Molson Centre on Dec. 29.

If one had to boil down what audiences will get out of this upcoming season at Young People’s Theatre, it’s this, says artistic director Allen MacInnis: the Seven Ancestral Teachings.

Rooted deep in Anishinaabe culture, they are respect, humility, bravery, honesty, love, wisdom and truth, and act as signposts by which to live and work well. Each of this year’s productions in YPT’s 2019/2020 season explores one or more of these seven teachings.

“I think we live in a time when we need to think about what makes us do what we do. How do we do better? And thinking about these things doesn’t have to be done in a full or overly serious way. Sometimes it’s in something entertaining and fun and delightful that we realize what’s good in the world and in us,” MacInnis says.

Anyone in the theatre community will tell you about the importance of volunteers, many of whom step up to help any way they can, just for the love of it.

There is no better feeling of community than what comes with being a volunteer, establishing longlasting emotional connections with other people who have that same level of interest and passion for local theatre, the arts and the not-for-profit community.

When Rose Theatre in Brampton, Ont., asked its volunteers why they get involved, the top three responses were: to give back to the community; to stay active; and to be a part of theatre and arts culture. Volunteering in the arts is particularly important to seniors and retirees. At the Rose, these are the lobby greeters, theatre ushers, ticket takers, coat-check people and event hosts.

“Their contribution to theatre and arts and culture in Brampton is something that cannot be measured in hours or shifts worked, but in exceptional service and connections created,” says Cristina Rizzuto, co-ordinator for performing arts marketing at the Rose. “Our volunteers welcome our patrons to the theatre as though they are welcoming them home.”

The McMichael Canadian Art Collection has a core of 150 volunteers who serve on the board of trustees, the McMichael Youth Team, the McMichael Volunteer Committee and with staff members on the Moonlight Gala, the McMichael’s signature annual fundraiser.

Those volunteers assist visitors, participate in community outreach and provide crucial event support throughout the year. Their gallery docents are trained volunteers who lead visitors on interactive tours of the gallery’s ground and exhibitions.

Roberta Smith, vice-president and chief of staff for the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, says volunteers are “vital to the success of the TSO.”

The Toronto Symphony Volunteer Committee, with 150 members and which has been in existence almost as long as the TSO itself, is credited with bolstering the financial health of the TSO and with helping to expand awareness of its musical and education programs. That includes hosting fundraising events such as wine auctions and marathons.

“They are not only ambassadors for the orchestra, but they are very much like family,” she says.

Stacey Arppe, volunteer manager at the Canadian Canoe Museum in Peterborough, Ont., actually keeps a tally of the number of hours booked in by museum’s 180 volunteers: 19,648 hours were logged in 2018 by the people who support every department and program at the museum.

Story continues below advertisement

“A large contingent of our volunteers are paddlers themselves with a passion for canoeing, camping and outdoor pursuits,” says Arppe.

“We consciously strive to foster a strong sense of community among our volunteers, so some join us to network, meet new people and connect with like-minded individuals.”

One of those volunteers, Dale Standen, says he is a historian and canoeist, with a connection to the museum going back to its roots. Again, the payoff for volunteers like Standen is the emotional connection to the topic and what the museum or gallery represents both personally and to the community.

“The museum’s collection is unparalleled in its richness, and its preservation is an important project,” he says.

“Working with people who share the same sense of the value of the museum to the community is personally rewarding. It is also fun.”

Walter Emrich, a collections and exhibition volunteer at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre, at Queen’s University in Kingston, was a practising doctor who retired four years ago. His aim was to volunteer in an area different from his professional life. This is popular thinking among retirees who volunteer.

Story continues below advertisement

After becoming a member at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre just before retiring, he soon found that the gallery’s collection numbered more than 17,000 items, and that there were collection managers and curators who all needed help. That’s how he jumped in.

His job is to do collections condition reporting – doing a walk around the gallery on a weekly basis, looking for any changes in all the exhibited artwork. That could be aging factors such as paint flaking off an oil painting, or paintings warping. It could be contact of the works with gallery visitors or attendants, such as fingerprints or dust on frames.

“After reviewing the various pieces for several weeks I feel like I have a personal relationship and attachment with that work,” Emrich says.

“I’m allowed to be in an environment of creativity and am able to give my time to help in a small way to maintain and preserve that creativity, so that others may benefit from it.”

It is certainly the notion of giving back that appeals to many volunteers.

“At this point in my life I feel an obligation to give something back, to share the knowledge I have accumulated and to mentor others. Volunteering at Agnes provides me with an opportunity to do that,” says Christina MacLachlan, community docent at Agnes.

Young and old, volunteers are crucial to the arts community. Opera Atelier’s crew of volunteers, called on to help out in the office, on larger projects and mailings, especially for the annual gala, are a core group of friendly, dedicated opera lovers.

“From mailings to helping staff our gala and our education/outreach programs, volunteers are the reason it all works,” says Rebekah Lobosco Gilli, development manager for Opera Atelier.

Toronto’s Tarragon Theatre calls on 100 to 120 volunteers each season to cover off duties such as front-of-house usher, as well as to provide gala and administration assistance.

“We do offer the opportunity to see the performances when they’ve assisted us, so that’s certainly a motivator,” says Cameron Johnston, director of marketing for Tarragon Theatre.

“Beyond that, Tarragon volunteers are genuinely passionate about the work we’re doing. They’re our best, most honest audience.”

The idea that art imitates life has been around for centuries and there’s a good reason for it.

Real life stories resonate with an audience, grabbing their emotions, whether it be a theatre production, musical performance, art piece or a photographic exhibition.

“Those who don’t remember history are doomed to repeat it,” says Clyde Wagner, president and chief executive officer of TO Live, which is putting on the major exhibition Mandela.

“That’s critical at this time, particularly here in North America as I think we see value-based movements in your marketplace. When we were approached by the Canadian Human Rights Museum … it didn’t take us five seconds to say yeah we would like to do [the exhibition],” Wagner says.

“The reason we want to do it is because it’s germane to our mandate, which is to reflect the city on the stage but also to create public dialogue around important topics of the day, and the topic of equality, diversity and human rights is one that’s being questioned I find.”

A rich sensory experience of imagery, soundscape, digital media and objects, Mandela explores Nelson Mandela’s fight for justice and human dignity in South Africa. Among the exhibition’s many dramatic visual features and original artifacts is a replica of Mandela's eight-foot by seven-foot prison cell.

Previously known as Civic Theatres Toronto, TO Live is one of Canada’s largest multi-arts organizations, operating three iconic venues and presenting a full range of performing arts, theatrical and concert events in both downtown and uptown Toronto at Meridian Hall (formerly the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts), St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts and the Meridian Arts Centre (formerly the Toronto Centre for the Arts).

“Art or the creative arts in any format – visual arts, music, dance, theatre, architecture, design all of these things – have a way to inspire people and engage with the public that is both able to be accepted by a broad audience but also emotionally connected to a topic,” Wagner says.

“Great art can touch people whether it has a social message or not. If it has a social message like the exhibition … then it also falls into a category of things that we’re inspired to do.”

Andrey Tarasiuk is artistic director at Pleiades Theatre, which is presenting Besbouss: An Autopsy of a Revolt, the English-language premiere of a story inspired by the headlines and running in November. It’s based on the Arab Spring uprisings in Tunisia that were triggered by the self-immolation of a street vendor named Mohamed Bouazizi in 2010.

“For me, essential to this play is it really sort of sits in a place where it asks the question: ‘Can one person make a difference?’ … The play is the starting point for a conversation is how I view this production,” he says.

“The issues don’t escape us. I think it behooves artists to examine global events and the impact of those global events on all of us and to be fearless in posing questions. Why is this happening? And what are the consequences? How do these events impact on our lives? These are critical and imperative questions that need to be responded to by artists. I feel very strongly about that and artists are up to that task,” Tarasiuk adds.

Majdi Bou-Matar, director of Besbouss, says art tells stories by taking historical events and figures as source material but then making it more relevant way to audiences today.

“Real events in history is material out there that belongs to anyone. The main thing is how do we use those events as a tool to tell our stories in the here and now,” he says.

While the modern hybrid vehicle seems like a relatively new invention, it’s been on the scene for two decades.

The first hybrid sold in North America was the original Honda Insight, which debuted in December 1999. It was revolutionary: a compact hatchback with slick aerodynamics and an advanced hybrid powertrain that consumed just 4.4 litres of fuel per 100 kilometres (4.4 L/100 km) in combined driving.

Since breaking the mold at the start of the millennium, the engineers at Honda have spent the past 20 years perfecting the hybrid powertrain, with models such as the Honda Civic Hybrid (2001 to 2015), the original Honda Accord Hybrid (2005 to 2007) and the Honda CR-Z (2010 to 2016). These vehicles used a different version of the manufacturer’s Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) system, in which an electric motor is mounted between the internal combustion engine (ICE) and the transmission.

Car buyers loved them. By the end of 2012, Honda had sold a million hybrid-powered vehicles around the world. Since then, the Honda hybrid fleet has gone from strength to strength, unveiling better technology, increased efficiency, and more bang for the buck.

For the new model year, Canadians have three Honda hybrids to choose from, with the 2020 Honda Clarity Plug-In Hybrid, the 2020 Honda Accord Hybrid and the 2020 Honda Insight Hybrid.

Some auto makers are pursuing all-electric vehicles in an effort to meet increasingly stringent, government-mandated fleet emissions standards around the world. Honda has dedicated itself to reducing emissions for decades, so the company is able to take a different path.

A 2019 report from Environment & Climate Change Canada bears this out. Based on 2017 data, it identifies the Honda Canada fleet as having the best overall fuel economy in the industry, and lower-than-average CO2 emissions among ICE manufacturers.

At Honda, the focus is on the present and the future. For now, the goal is to continue to provide Canadians with vehicles that are well-engineered, fuel-efficient and fun to drive. No matter which model drives off the lot, it will be a leader in terms of its carbon footprint, without compromising on any of the other qualities for which Honda is renowned. Honda owners also have the comfort of knowing they’re taking steps toward reducing their own carbon footprint.

As for the future? As Honda pursues even greener numbers across the board, two-thirds of its global vehicle sales will be electrified by the year 2030. Some models will be electric vehicles (EVs), while others will be hybrids. Honda has the luxury of being able to take a measured approach to introducing next-generation electrified powertrains – putting them on the road only when they’re fully proven.

Even the best EVs demand some form of compromise. For certain all-electric vehicles, range is still a concern, higher price points are limiting, and there are the logistics of charging to consider. But when you’re behind the wheel of a hybrid engineered by a company with decades of experience in electrification, there is no compromise.

These are confusing times. Consumers are bombarded with countless sources of information, and it’s difficult to sort out fact from fiction.

Honda Canada has responded with a clear and concise approach to communicating the environmental footprint of its vehicles. In an era of growing climate-change awareness, consumers and environmentalists want to know how the automotive industry is taking action, and confusion should not be an option when it comes time to make a purchase.

The new campaign, available to view at honda.ca, provides verified data on CO2 emissions for each model sold in Canada, and it gives consumers useful information on reducing their own carbon footprints. The campaign doesn’t just represent a return to the company’s roots, says Jean Marc Leclerc, senior vice-president of sales and marketing for Honda Canada – it’s a reaffirmation.

Story continues below advertisement

“A focus on fuel efficiency and using fewer resources has been part of our DNA for a long time,” he explains. “We have a history in this space, so we believe it’s our responsibility at Honda Canada to change the conversation, to get consumers thinking about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a different way.”

An industry first, the campaign builds on the most recent federal government GHG report, entitled Greenhouse Gas Emissions Performance for the 2017 Model Year Light-Duty Vehicle Fleet, published by Environment & Climate Change Canada last year. The report verifies that the Honda Canada fleet had the best overall fuel economy in the industry, and lower-than-average carbon emissions among internal combustion engine (ICE) manufacturers.

Based on the data, the Honda Canada website lists how many grams of CO2 its vehicles emit per kilometre. It’s a recognition by the company that environmental performance is a competitive advantage.

“The campaign follows the model the food industry used when it introduced calorie counts,” Leclerc says. “The automotive industry is far behind the food industry right now, but we can bridge the gap – it’s all about giving consumers what they need to make informed decisions.”

Visitors to the Honda Canada website can also make quick comparisons among models. For example, a shopper interested in a Honda Pilot because it suits their lifestyle may decide that they can make a Honda Civic work instead. “The core of the idea is to focus – or refocus – on reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” Leclerc says.

“Whether you’re driving an SUV with an internal combustion engine or a compact car or a hybrid, there are vehicles in every category that perform better than others. At Honda, we have some of the best performing vehicles in the business and we’re just reintroducing this to the Canadian consumer from a different perspective.”

The Honda Canada campaign, Driven to Reduce Emissions Since 1948, says its global organization plans for electric to represent two-thirds of its vehicle sales by 2030, an ambitious target that incorporates a measured approach to technological innovation. It aims to reduce carbon emissions across its business and manufacturing operations.

Story continues below advertisement

This focus on the environment also extends to a number of social causes in Canada, as one of four key pillars of the Honda Canada Foundation. Through the Foundation, Honda partners with charities that bring environmental education to classrooms and after-school programs across Canada.

The Foundation’s long-term partnership with Earth Rangers, a kids’ conservation organization, educates young people across the country about animals and the environment through the School Assembly Program, igniting a spark of enthusiasm that motivates children to start taking action to help protect the environment.

Concern for the environment is not new to Honda. In 1972, the company introduced the CVCC engine, the first to meet U.S. Clean Air Act standards without the need for a catalytic converter. And last year, it announced a long-term agreement to purchase renewable wind and solar power to cover more than 60 per cent of the company’s electricity requirements in North America.

All of Honda Canada’s decisions fall under the global “Blue Skies for Our Children” umbrella: a wide-ranging environmental directive to do what the company can to give future generations the opportunity to experience the joy and freedom of mobility while living in a sustainable society.

Corolla has been part of millions of Canadian lives for more than 50 years and is our all-time best-selling model. — Cyril Dimitris, vice president, Toyota Canada Inc.

Now in its 11th generation, the venerable Corolla model is one of the most iconic and popular compact cars in North America. And it is consistently one of the top-selling vehicles in Canada, accounting for about 1.5 million of the more than 40 million Corolla vehicles sold globally.

Open this photo in gallery The Corolla, now in its 11th generation, continues to draw attention and eyes.

“Corolla has been part of millions of Canadian lives for more than 50 years and is our all-time best-selling model,” said Cyril Dimitris, vice president, Toyota Canada Inc. “It’s sporty styling and handling make it fun-to-drive, while its state-of-the-art safety and legendary dependability and efficiency make it a pleasure to own.”

The Corolla has built a loyal fan-base of owners who keep returning to the brand year-after-year, thanks to things like reliability and handling, as well as first-time buyers attracted to the unique style, elaborate accents and standard safety equipment.

Margaret Schuler, of Belleville, Ontario, who now drives a Corolla, has kept coming back to Toyota.

“I’ve had a few Toyotas over the years, from the Tercel back in the 1980s to the Matrix in the 1990s, and I had a Corolla before this one too,” she explained.

“Nothing ever goes wrong with them, they are literally so reliable. The service is good too.”

She also likes the fact that the resale value holds up, due mostly to the reputation the brand carries, and the front and centre standard features included in the TSS system.

Open this photo in gallery It’s difficult to remember a Canadian road-trip when if you didn’t see a Toyota Corolla on the highway, then you were likely driving in one. Shown here is a 1969 model.

The Corolla also includes comfort and security innovations, such as the Display Audio system with SIRI Eyes-Free, Bluetooth connectivity and steering wheel-mounted controls. Then there’s the dual power adjustable seats (available on LE and SE grades only), heated exterior mirrors, power doors and windows, piano-black centre cluster accents, map lamps, and 12v power outlets for personal electronics. With cabin space for five people, the 2019 Toyota Corolla sedan is, as always, comfortable and safe, driven by the ever-reliable 1.8L four-cylinder engine that pushes a peak 132 horsepower which pops to 140 horsepower in the ECO LE model.

Strap either of those to the proven choice of manual transmission or the CVTi-S with sport mode, sequential shift mode and paddle shifters and you’re getting traction in the right direction.

A loyal fan, Ms. Schuler said when it’s time to trade-in her current Corolla, she’ll be returning to Toyota again, adding: “There are other compact cars which may look similar, but I don’t think they’re built as well as the Toyotas.”

A lot of people have been saying that for many years.

It’s why among the vehicles we love, the Corolla – always evolving – has a special place among Canadian drivers.

Low-rise and mid-rise projects allow different entry points for prospective home buyers to upsize or downsize

When considering buying a home in the Greater Toronto Area, you may want to consider a segment of the market known to developers and planners as the missing middle.

That’s the gap that exists between home types that are either single, detached houses or towering condos. It’s where semi-detached houses, townhomes, and low-rise and mid-rise buildings are choices for young adults seeking to grow a family or empty nesters who may want to downsize but stay in their neighbourhood.

The problem? Traditional zoning regulations and building policies in the GTA haven’t made it easy to build this kind of housing in the past, even though buyers are seeking it.

“Various folks have used the missing middle as a term in different contexts,” says Bill Gairdner, president of Gairloch Developments in Toronto. “It was meant to describe everything from semi-detached [homes] to townhomes to walk-up apartments to mid-rise, which would be the top of it.”

Rules created more than a century ago to prevent walk-up apartment buildings from encroaching on established residential neighbourhoods in Toronto have not kept pace with the times.

A National Housing Innovation Series hosted by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) and The Globe and Mail last year heard that moving just one per cent of single-family dwellings in Toronto to the “missing middle” segment would result in 44,000 new units, which would be the capacity of 140 new high-rises.

“The missing middle provides different entry points to upsize or downsize,” Gairdner says, who has a passion for creating mid-rise boutique projects in Toronto.

“The more supply that we can deliver in the development industry, the better chances we have to tackle the affordability issue.”

It’s not just the zoning regulations, but also a degree of NIMBY-ism (Not In My Backyard) attitudes in traditional neighbourhoods that prevents the missing middle housing stock to grow.

Story continues below advertisement

“My projects are in well-established neighbourhoods or ones that are up-and-coming,” Gairdner says. “You want to make it as easy as possible for developers to acquire land and build the kind of product that people want to live in.”

There are green shoots showing, however, as politicians and policy makers understand that a greater diversity of housing is needed to help Toronto and region advance in a way that expands affordability.

“Basically, you need strong progressive politicians who are confident enough to help advance reasonable mid-rise development, in spite of the fact that their constituents may be objecting to the change with typical NIMBY concerns,” Gairdner says.

American architect Daniel Parolek is credited with launching the term “missing middle” a decade ago. He described it as a range of multi-unit or clustered housing types compatible in scale with single-family homes that help meet the growing demand for walkable urban living.

Gairloch’s 1414 Bayview project is an eight-storey luxury condominium development in Toronto’s Leaside neighbourhood. One month into sales, 20 of the 44 units (one, two and three-bedroom suites with pricing from $650,000) had been sold.

The 1414 Bayview project was designed specifically to fit into the neighbourhood, Gairdner says, and it retains several rental units that expand affordability in accordance with city guidelines.

Another Gairloch condo project, the eight-storey, mid-rise Junction Point with 111 units at 2625 Dundas St. W. is scheduled to break ground in early 2021. Just north of High Park and 20 minutes from downtown, sales are expected to ramp up in September.

While the pandemic has made the sales process slower, prompting one-on-one appointments rather than big sales events, demand remains strong, Gairdner says.

When the Canadian Urban Institute and Evergreen Housing Action Lab examined missing middle housing in Toronto in 2017-18, the resulting report noted that, as rental housing is harder to find, and housing becomes more expensive, younger and middle-aged households have difficulty accessing the ownership market.

The report recommended options to add “gentle” density to Toronto’s neighbourhoods and consider zoning alternatives, as well as options to reduce development costs for mid-rise and other missing middle housing types.

More developers are beginning to add mid-rise development to their portfolios, Gairdner says. “It’s getting more competitive for the missing middle and there are fewer sites in Toronto, so now larger developers are taking on mid-rise projects, whereas before they’d look at the scale being too small.”

The missing middle housing segment is typically not attractive to foreign investors, who might otherwise buy units as investments and hold them or rent them out from afar.

The pandemic has shone a light on urban density, prompting questions about whether now is the time to trade big city living for more wide-open spaces.

“I can see the logic of wanting to escape to the country, but there is the commute situation and you’re still dealing with trains or subway or cars, so there is no silver bullet,” Gairdner says.

“Our business model aligns well with having larger, more customizable units without sharing an elevator with hundreds of people or having six levels of underground parking.”

Looking beyond the city, the 130-home Riverside Estates project by Ambria Homes, situated in the Peterborough area along the picturesque Otonabee River, gives the nod to living in wider spaces. The distance between Toronto and Peterborough is 137 km.

“The project has walking trails, a boat launch, ponds and it’s on the river, so it is a good combination of estate homes and nature,” says Lily Lancia, a management executive at Ambria Homes.

“You can feel like you are part of the landscape.”

Both first-time home buyers and retirees are looking to enjoy a lifestyle beside a river, she says. The pedestrian walkways wind past green spaces and ponds with places to relax and just soak up being in nature.

Trent University, Fleming College and Trillium College are all nearby, as are a full range of education choices in Peterborough.

“People are willing to go a little farther beyond the city for nature, especially given that Highway 407 has been extended and the project is really not that far from Toronto,” Lancia says.

Pet owners are looking for spaces that have all the amenities for their furry companions

With more people owning pets, real estate developers are having to make sure pet-friendly amenities are front and centre when planning projects.

That’s especially true when looking at the millennial generation, the next big wave of condominium buyers. According to a large, recent study by Rover.com, a Seattle-based, international network of pet sitters and dog walkers, traditional family habits are shifting to better cater to such pets as cats and dogs, and that is affecting purchasing decisions such as buying a home.

Story continues below advertisement

“With millennials waiting longer to have kids, many are turning to pet parenting, which we’re now seeing is having a major impact on their home-buying decisions,” says Debbie Soon, head of Rover Canada. “We’ve found that 42 per cent of pet parents factor their pets into their home-buying decisions and, with pet ownership growing in Toronto, we only anticipate that number to grow.”

Also according to the study, 40 per cent said pets affect their decisions when it comes to buying a car, and 37 per cent when choosing furniture.

According to Statista, the pet food market in Canada is worth approximately $1.9-billion. The Canadian Animal Health Institute said there were 8.2 million dogs and 8.3 million cats in Canadian households in 2018, with 41 per cent of households having at least one dog and 38 per cent having at least one cat. For developers, that means accommodating pet owners is top of mind.

At Riverbend Estates, a project by Ambria Homes in Peterborough that features grand country manors, homes come with large 70-foot lots. Ponds and walkways are designed in a natural way within the community site plan, creating countless opportunities to enjoy pet-friendly outdoor living.

Accommodating pets is also very much the focus for Menkes Developments through their various projects in and around Toronto, says Mimi Ng, senior vice-president of residential sales and marketing.

“We don’t actively track the number of buyers with pets, but anecdotally I can definitely say that we have noticed an increased number of purchaser enquiries about pet facilities and policies or rules around pets in our projects,” she says.

“Generally speaking, Toronto condo developers have become more cognizant of pet ownership and many are incorporating pet-friendly features and spaces in the design of indoor and outdoor amenity areas.”

Story continues below advertisement

Specifically, with their earlier projects, Menkes built basic pet-washing stations, usually situated near the building entrance, so residents could rinse off their dog’s paws.

“Our current projects build on that, with expanded pet-washing facilities, which would be appreciated by anyone who has ever tried bathing a large dog in a condo,” Ng adds, “as well as outdoor dog runs and play spaces.”

In their upcoming Festival condominium community in Vaughan Metropolitan Centre (VMC), there will be a dog park on the outdoor terrace, with play areas and a dog relief zone complete with a fake fire hydrant and drainage infrastructure.

Like with the numerous dog parks that have become such an integral part of downtown Toronto living, these will no doubt become popular places for residents of the building and help to foster a sense of community.

In the end, with these types of amenities, not only will the pets be thankful, but the pet owners will likely be thanking developers as well.

While the economy has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, realtors have been seeing activity return and say the real estate market might rebound much faster than anticipated

The real estate market in the Greater Toronto Area was red-hot at the start of the year, with a low interest rate environment and strong employment growth.

Then, of course, COVID-19 came along and shattered those prospects.

Story continues below advertisement

With mandated business closures and a loss of consumer confidence, The Conference Board of Canada expects to see an 8.2 per cent contraction of the Canadian economy this year – the worst annual contraction on record – according to its Canadian Outlook Summary: Summer 2020.

The think tank also forecasts a decline of 11 per cent in the average home price between the first and third quarters of this year.

But it’s not all bad news: The Conference Board expects the economy will rebound by 6.7 per cent in 2021 and 4.8 per cent in 2022, depending on how well the post-COVID recovery is managed and if there’s a second wave severe enough to shut down the economy again.

“There are a lot of unknowns floating around out there,” says Robin Wiebe, the board’s chief economist. “The question is how is employment going to recover, because employment is critical to the housing market.”

Another factor is the desirability of living downtown, after this period of residents being cooped up in condos with lack of green space. It’s the “topic du jour,” Wiebe says, because several companies have decided to permanently scrap the office, so employees might now consider moving to a larger property outside of the GTA.

But Toronto has experienced rapid population growth in recent years, so there’s also pent-up demand.

“Once COVID-19 is past and hopefully most people are back to work, the underlying demographics are favourable,” Wiebe says. “Toronto is not overbuilt by any stretch.”

Story continues below advertisement

This is also what realtors are seeing on the ground. “We’ve already seen a dramatic uptick in national activity in May and June, and we expect this trend to continue through the summer,” says Christopher Alexander, executive vice-president and regional director with RE/MAX of Ontario-Atlantic Canada.

“We credit this to the pre-existing pent-up demand for homes in hot markets such as Vancouver, Toronto and Ottawa, which helped mitigate the decline in transactions that were paused due to the pandemic.”

The Canadian market saw a steep year-over-year decline in the volume of transactions during the peak of COVID-19, according to data from RE/MAX Canada.

However, exceptionally low inventory in much of Canada has been a key factor in price stability throughout the pandemic, Alexander says, and will likely result in continued upward price pressure as restrictions ease and demand increases further.

“We’re already seeing a return to pre-pandemic activity – and then some – with multiple-offer scenarios in markets like Toronto, Ottawa and Vancouver. This indicates to us that markets could improve much faster than we initially anticipated at the beginning of COVID-19,” Alexander says.

According to a Leger survey conducted on behalf of RE/MAX Canada, 56 per cent of Canadians planning to engage in the real estate market expect to do so in less than a year.

Story continues below advertisement

While sales volumes have declined, prices have held, says Jared Menkes, executive vice-president of high-rise residential with Menkes Developments. “We are seeing signs of pent-up demand and positive sentiments among buyers, with the number of inquiries and people resuming their housing research growing every week.”

Although COVID-19 has put a pause on peoples’ lives, “their changing housing needs don’t just go away,” Menkes says.

“People are still getting engaged, having babies or wanting to move out from their family homes. If anything, being at home during COVID has caused many households to re-evaluate their space needs and made them realize that they do need to upsize or upgrade their existing home.”

Indeed, more people are looking for “vacation-like properties,” he says, and there has been a surge in demand for homes that have active areas and green spaces. That has been a key focus for Menkes for some time now – certainly before the pandemic.

“Sugar Wharf is a perfect example of a project that was developed with a resort-like theme, aimed at offering future residents a wide range of outdoor amenities, plus the development includes a new two-acre community park,” Menkes says.

The developer has continued this focus with its Mobilio project located in Vaughan. Aside from the outdoor spaces it’s creating within the development, the site will also be anchored by a linear park, part of Vaughan’s Black Creek renewal project. Once completed, it will establish a series of promenades and parks that span more than 30 acres.

“While we aim to incorporate these aspects into the development and design of our projects, we also look at what the surrounding area will offer,” Menkes says. For example, with a project like Sugar Wharf, residents will also have easy access to the Toronto waterfront and islands.

Shane Baghai, president of Baghai Developments, is also seeing the market start to pick up, after delays related to shipping and new construction protocols.

“COVID really did a number on builders,” he says. “Now things are starting to move and I see vibrancy in the city.”

Indeed, as far as the market is concerned, “it’s almost as buoyant and active as before, in some cases even more so.”

With first-time buyers, “condo sales have probably dropped marginally,” Baghai says, but there’s demand for two- and three-bedroom condos, particularly if those condo units have large balconies or terraces. Leaside Manor, for example, is well-suited to meet this demand with spacious two- and three-bedroom suites plus den.

“We’ve been pleasantly surprised – we’ve got a ton of interest,” says Bill Gairdner, founder and president of Gairloch Developments, which launched its eight-storey development at 1414 Bayview at the start of June. “We’re at 35 per cent sold, so that was really positive considering there was no launch event or flashy festivities.”

COURTESY OF MENKES DEVELOPMENTS

Launching in June was “somewhat of a risky move,” Gairdner says. “The vast majority of developers I know have all deferred to the fall with the idea that the fall will be a new world order.”

But he says there’s not a lot of product like 1414 Bayview in the Leaside neighbourhood, “so there’s pent-up demand,” he says.

“So it’s not reflective of the whole market. I don’t think it’s indicative of how condos are doing industry-wide. Our business model is well aligned with COVID or post-COVID.”

The condominium has only 44 units, many with generous private terraces and fewer communal spaces or shared amenities that tenants may be reluctant to use, especially if there’s a second wave of COVID-19 in the fall. At the same time, buyers want to make sure they have access to outdoor spaces.

“The neighbourhood itself is the amenity: the Don Valley trails, the Mount Pleasant Cemetery, the retail strip up and down Bayview,” Gairdner says.

“None of our projects have been too focused on saunas or spas or pools. It’s all very understated, more boutique style.”

RE/MAX expects to see relative price stability by the end of 2020, with a possible price correction in the single digits.

“That said, due to the high degree of uncertainty around the pandemic and a possible second wave in the fall, it’s difficult to predict beyond 2020 at this time,” Alexander says.

“If the first wave of COVID-19 has taught us anything, it’s to expect the unexpected and be prepared to pivot.”

For financial advisors and investors, the past decade has been about adjusting to the ‘new normal’ in portfolio construction.

Facing lower yields from fixed income, many portfolios have undergone a facelift as investors looking for greater returns jumped from safe, low-return, fixed-income instruments to riskier, higher-yielding bonds or dividend-paying stocks.

“The fixed-income portion of the portfolio has become much more complicated – to say the least,” says Ahmed Farooq, vice-president of exchange-traded fund (ETF) business development at Franklin Templeton Investments in Toronto.

Story continues below advertisement

Even for advisors, building this life preserver part of the portfolio has been challenging, particularly when it comes to convincing clients they need fixed income after more than a decade of rising equity markets and morose bond returns.

“It’s not an easy game,” says Edward Jong, a fixed-income portfolio manager with T.I.P. Wealth Manager Inc. in Toronto.

He notes among the challenges for fixed income is the low return environment globally, in which European and other nations have issued more than $11-trillion in bonds with negative yields.

“If rates are kept low, where does one look to generate extra income?” Mr. Jong asks.

Traditional portfolio construction is “predicated heavily on modern portfolio theory and the advantages of diversification” and does not necessarily work like it did more than a decade ago, says David Andrews, vice-president and client portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Investments in Toronto.

The diversification and risk-reducing benefit of adding bonds to equities has weakened. That means investors will need to start considering their options when seeking the safety cushion fixed-income investments provide.

While Canadian and U.S. fixed-income yields aren’t yet negative, they’re still losing propositions after inflation and taxation.

Story continues below advertisement

However, a strong argument can be made that investors’ portfolios need greater exposure to fixed income today more than ever. As Mr. Farooq notes, it’s more than likely many portfolios are out of balance from their original investment goals.

“In the 10 years of this reigning bull market, a lot of investors lost focus on the fixed-income exposure just because equities were up,” he says.

Moreover, if investors were buying fixed income, it was often “higher-octane” bonds, Mr. Farooq adds.

Most advisors acknowledge fixed income’s value as a portfolio cushion, padding against equities’ downside; driving that point home to clients is another matter, though.

“You have to do a lot of education,” says Adrian Mastracci, discretionary portfolio manager at Lycos Asset Management Inc. in Vancouver.

Specifically, he says he must explain to clients often that fixed income is necessary, albeit bitter, medicine for long-term portfolio health.

Story continues below advertisement

“Sometimes, when you look at the [fixed-income] returns you just have to hold your breath and carry on. That’s what I tell my clients,” he says.

Mr. Mastracci uses several portfolio management tools to get better fixed-income exposure, including individual bonds, guaranteed investment certificates and ETFs.

But it’s ETFs that have been a game-changer for bond investing in the past decade, with investors happy to take what a low-cost, diversified passive strategy gives them.

While that’s worked well over the past 10 years, a passive strategy may not be as rewarding over the next decade, Mr. Andrews says.

For example, a Canadian bond ETF that tracks a benchmark index by design will be affected, inevitably, by Canada’s large energy sector, which remains mired in a slump. That may pose more risk than advisors and investors are comfortable with going forward.

That’s where a new breed of ETFs may prove their worth. They’re actively managed with low management expense ratios (MERs) that look beyond traditional ETF investing.

Active ETFs start by tracking a benchmark index and a portfolio manager has the flexibility to deviate from the designated index or sector allocations to achieve alpha – better returns – based on their analysis.

These fund managers have the greenlight to adjust their portfolios tactically in response to events such as monetary policy changes, geopolitical events, interest rate changes or more – all of which can make fixed-income investments tougher to navigate.

Truly active portfolio managers also have the tools and the research capabilities to select bonds properly in an effort to help deliver better investor outcomes, while a passive portfolio manager has to match the fundamentals of the benchmark index.

This new generation of ETFs might involve, for example, providing broad exposure to Canadian government and blue-chip corporate bonds while leaving a significant allocation – say, up to 30 per cent of the portfolio – “designed to fill gaps that are not fulfilled in the Canadian bond marketplace … with investments that are off the Canadian benchmark,” Mr. Andrews explains.

That allocation might include high-yield U.S. bonds and short-term bank loans to generate a positive real return in the fixed-income allocation of the portfolio, he adds.

Or, an actively managed global bond ETF might still be “benchmark aware” providing, for example, diversified exposure based on the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index, but with a “fundamental screen on top,” Mr. Farooq says.

As such, the fund manager can underweight geographical allocations on the benchmark, which have negative yields and instead overweight “other countries with a positive outlook,” he says.

Also noteworthy is that actively managed ETFs can come with management fees that are competitive with those of passive products.

“It’s never been cheaper to get diversified exposure to bonds in the portfolio,” Mr. Andrews adds.

Put another way, advisors and even do-it-yourself investors don’t have to go it alone constructing the fixed-income portion of the portfolio unless, of course, they want to.

“For the most part, advisors are more comfortable with the equity side of the equation but some less comfortable managing the uncertainty we have with fixed-income market going forward,” Mr. Andrews says.

‘Smart beta’ has emerged as the next stage of advancement for investors and financial advisors interested in diversified, low-cost equity exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have performed swimmingly during the past decade thanks to the U.S. bull market’s rising tide.

Smart beta ETFs screen investments for factors beyond market-capitalization weightings associated with traditional ETFs – and they’re becoming increasingly popular.

According to ETF.com, more than 1,000 smart beta ETFs now trade on North American stock markets, including 95 that were launched last year. Investors have poured more than US$1-trillion into the category.

Todd Mathias, certified financial analyst, vice-president–senior ETF product strategist at Franklin Templeton Investments in San Mateo, Calif., says their popularity is driven in part by investment advisors, who are increasingly wary of clients’ overexposure to broad-based indexes like the S&P 500.

“Many [advisors] tell me they have been worried about this for a few years, and it only becomes more top of mind when you look at the current multiples [in stock prices],” he says.

Thus, advisors are looking to smart beta strategies as a way to moderate risk while providing some form of protection if the market reverses quickly.

“Smart beta rewrites the traditional index rulebook, which weights and invests by the size of the company’s security,” Mr. Mathias says.

In contrast, smart beta’s factor-based index approach employs research-driven strategies to screen stocks for an ETF portfolio.

Typically, these screens encompass one of five strategies: quality (companies with good earnings growth), value (firms that are undervalued), momentum (stocks that have stronger recent price appreciation), low volatility (companies with lower risk than the market) and dividend (those firms paying out higher dividends than average).

In the past couple of years, the low-volatility subcategory has been especially popular, according to National Bank of Canada Financial Inc., which tracks ETFs.

The firm reports it has seen waves of inflows into smart beta ETFs. In 2019 alone, low-volatility ETFs attracted $2.5-billion in Canada, and much of this inflow came in the aftermath of the U.S. market selloff in late 2018.

Mr. Mathias points to the past year as an example. In the first six months of 2019, a low-volatility smart beta ETF would have outperformed the market. The second half of the year was a different story, though, with the strategy lagging behind the S&P 500 by about 8 per cent.

Due to the cyclical nature of each smart beta strategy, investors face the challenge of selecting the right factor to not only match current market conditions but future ones, too. Essentially, advisors run the risk of picking the wrong ETF at the wrong time.

The industry has moved to address this by creating multi-factor smart beta ETFs.

Mr. Mathias says these multi-factor ETF strategies essentially give investors another layer of diversification, providing exposure to several factors at once in one low-cost, liquid portfolio.

“By combining these factors thoughtfully, you can enhance returns and reduce risk, while still keeping clients invested in equity markets,” he says.

Mr. Mathias says Franklin Templeton offers four multi-factor ETFs in its suite of ETFs in Canada. Among them is Franklin LibertyQT U.S. Equity Index ETF (FLUS), which has attracted more than $240-million in client assets since its 2017 launch in Canada.

FLUS utilizes a rules-based approach to select U.S. stocks, which have favourable exposure to four factors and strategically weighted: quality at 50 per cent, value at 30 per cent, momentum at 10 per cent and low volatility also at 10 per cent.

Mr. Mathias says Franklin Templeton’s smart beta offerings are not designed to capture all the upside of the broader markets. Rather, multi-factor ETFs seek to mitigate downside risk while capturing a substantial portion of the upside in the market.

Open this photo in gallery Jeremy Olen, chief investment officer, The Financial Services Network SUPPLIED

This emphasis on quality resonates with many advisors, he adds. Among them is Azeem Virjee, senior investment advisor and portfolio manager at Wellington-Altus Private Wealth Inc. in Calgary, who says “traditional portfolio construction” presents challenges because “market capitalization is based on two key assumptions:” markets are efficient and investors are rational. “In reality, [neither] is often not the case.”

Mr. Virjee adds that a single-beta approach, while useful at times, is not as desirable as a multi-factor ETF, which “helps smooth out returns” over time.

By design, multi-factor ETFs reduce the depth of market dips, which in turn helps keep clients happy, Mr. Mathias says.

“The strategy is basically saying, ‘I believe value, quality, momentum and low volatility are strategies worth investing in, but I don’t want to be on the wrong side with a strategy losing money one to two years,’” he explains. “So, by blending all these factors together in one product, I’m getting the best of all worlds.”

Jeremy Olen, chief investment officer at The Financial Services Network in Sacramento, Calif., which provides investing and portfolio consulting services to independent advisors, points out that multi-factor ETFs are ideal for expressing long-term market views in a client portfolio “in a low-cost, tax efficient manner.”

They often have low management expense ratios and because they offer exposure to several factors, advisors don’t have to trade in and out of single-factor ETFs to adjust to market conditions, which would otherwise increase trading costs and potentially lead to realized, taxable capital gains, he says.

Q&A with Paul MacDonald, CFA Chief Investment officer and portfolio manager, Harvest Portfolios Group Inc.

The healthcare sector rebounded strongly at the end of the year despite a weak start to 2019. That momentum should carry through in 2020, says Paul MacDonald, chief investment officer at Harvest Portfolio Group.

In an interview, Mr. MacDonald talked about the philosophy behind the Harvest Healthcare Leaders Income ETF (TSX: HHL, HHL.U), the long term energizers driving healthcare stocks and why the sector will continue to perform regardless of U.S. election year anxiety.

What do you see for the healthcare sector in 2020 and beyond?

Story continues below advertisement

Over the medium to longer term, the healthcare sector has several themes. The first is aging populations. The second is technological innovation in medical devices, equipment and drugs. The third is rising demand in emerging markets. These are permanent and noncyclical forces, so we want to be positioned there.

In the shorter-term, we see attractive valuations, though U.S. political noise will continue this year. But over the past three or four months there has been a positive shift in the sentiment towards the sector. It has been a noticeable change.

What were the surprises in 2019?

Healthcare was the second worst performing S&P sector behind energy. What drove that? In part the extreme views and rhetoric as the Democratic primaries came into focus early in the year. The talk about socializing the system worried some investors.

You could see that impact when it came to quarterly earnings. The stocks of companies with strong earnings and guidance would struggle to rally. If they missed earnings it was a very painful experience.

But as the year went on there was a shift. Companies were rewarded again for robust earnings. So, when I look at 2020, I think you have an environment where valuations are discounted, sentiment is improving and some of that extreme rhetoric has subsided. Policies are coming much closer to centre. When you put that together, we see an incredible longer-term opportunity.

How should investors approach the sector?

Story continues below advertisement

Our message to advisers is that if you want healthcare and income that’s what our fund is all about. If you want healthcare exposure you want to own a basket.

Medtech has been the shining star for several years and on the flip side, biotech has underperformed. Large cap biotech companies have been under pressure for the past 12 to 18 months. Even for hundred-billion-dollar market capitalization companies, a momentum shift can move share prices by 30 per cent in a very short span.

Medical technology companies have shown a clear growth picture. So, they’ve been afforded much higher multiples. Perhaps this is because they’re perceived to have less exposure to some of the political narrative. That trend could continue.

We want to be in those types of companies as a group. Any individual name, say Johnson & Johnson, a $375-billion company, can move 15 per cent up or down based on whether it’s the news, or there have been disappointing drug trials, political noise or the threat of lawsuits.

So, for us, diversity across the subsectors is key, being exposed to all areas including med techs, pharmaceuticals, biopharmaceuticals and managed care such as insurance.

How much will U.S. politics affect things in 2020?

Story continues below advertisement

We are likely to have rhetoric all year, but does the market look beyond it? It would seem to me that it is starting to do that.

What we saw in early 2019 is actually what I would’ve expected in early 2020. But as you peel back the layers of the system, you realize it is extraordinarily difficult to effect change.

There are numerous vested parties, whether it’s the manufacturers, distributors, whether it’s the insurance companies. There’s always going to be resistance to radical change.

Tell us about the Harvest Healthcare Leaders Income ETF

We have a very simple process to narrow down the universe of 3,000 companies to about 75. We require a minimum market capitalization of $10-billion. They have to be North American listed and have to have options trading so we can take advantage of our covered call strategy. The covered call strategy generates income by foregoing a little bit of the upside.

From the 75 companies we select 20, filtering for things like earnings, return on equity, cash flow metrics and balance sheet metrics. We look at it as a healthcare pie and want to make sure we have exposure to each one of the pieces: medtech, biotech, services, insurance and make sure we are not overexposed to any one area. We want to be diversified.

Story continues below advertisement

As at December 31, 2019, 42 per cent of the ETFs holdings are in pharmaceuticals, 20 per cent in biotechnology, 19 per cent in healthcare equipment and supplies and 16 per cent are healthcare providers.

How has the ETF performed?

The ETF posted a positive return in 2019 in a very volatile market. We’ve continued to generate growth and income. Even though healthcare was the second worst performing subsector behind energy in the S&P 500, we’re still up double digits for the year.

Do you have any final comments?

We are later cycle now. It is definitely the time to be invested in good quality businesses. That should always be the case, but even more so now.

We think that healthcare is an opportunity for those that can look beyond macro noise. It has defensive characteristics; good dividend yields and valuations that are at discounts to the broader market.

With Canadians facing slow growth in the economy at home, mild economic growth globally and continued low interest rates, it will be a challenge for financial advisors and investors alike to eke out decent fixed-income returns in their portfolios, investment experts warns.

In fact, Franklin Templeton Investments Corp.’s 2020 Capital Market Expectations report predicts that fixed-income returns on global government and corporate bonds will lag past rates of return.

That means advisors and investors will have to get creative when it comes to fixed-income investing and consider how to use active and passive investing strategies to make up the difference.

Story continues below advertisement

Darcy Briggs, senior vice-president, portfolio manager with Franklin Bissett Investment Management in Calgary, says the best strategy is to be nimble and cast a wide net for returns.

“Going into 2020, [interest] rates are relatively low, credit spreads are pretty tight and we are in a low-volatility environment,” he says. “This is a very unusual environment, it doesn’t happen very often.”

Dan Hallett, vice-president and principal at Oakville, Ont.-based Highview Financial Group worries that the extended bull market has “blinded investors to the risks they’re taking” when they allocate more of their investments to higher-returning equities and away from fixed-income.

Thus, he suggests investors stick with a traditional portfolio mix of 60 per cent equities and 40 per cent fixed income rather than abandoning the latter, which is risky.

“Generally speaking, investors’ bond allocations should largely stay intact,” Mr. Hallett argues. “Emphasizing high-quality corporate bonds can add a bit of extra yield [and] any reduction of bonds to redirect money to higher-returning assets should be done modestly.”

Yet, Mr. Briggs says his firm is cautious when approaching fixed-income investments in the current environment. Rather than looking for home runs or taking bold positioning, he says Franklin Bissett is “looking to play a little more defence and hit singles.”

That includes using multiple levers to generate returns in the current environment, one of which is investing in selective “fallen angels” – or using extensive credit analysis to buy debt opportunistically in companies that have been downgraded due to a weakened financial position.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Briggs provides the example of Cenovus Energy Inc., which lost its investment-grade status for a time in 2016.

“A number of investors can’t hold subinvestment-grade [debt],” he says. “So, we are monitoring these types of securities for potential opportunities”

Mr. Briggs expects similar buying opportunities may arise this year as the trend among public companies of late has been to increase leverage for numerous reasons, one of which was for share repurchases. The current environment has created conditions for overall credit ratings to migrate downward, generally, given company fundamentals at the current stage of the credit cycle.

Open this photo in gallery Darcy Briggs, senior vice-president, portfolio manager, Franklin Bissett Investment Management. SUPPLIED

“There comes a time that if global economic activity doesn’t pick up, some of these companies actually trip, which may create conditions leading to a credit rating downgrade to junk,” he says

The dividing line between “junk” and investment-grade bonds can create the potential of superior returns, he notes. One recent example he cites is supermarket operator Sobeys Inc., which dipped below investment-grade status before improving its operations.

Mr. Briggs also looks beyond Canada’s narrow fixed-income market as 85 per cent of it comprises of government bonds and debt issued by financial service firms.

Story continues below advertisement

He believes that investors have no choice but to embrace an active investment strategy to generate fixed-income returns in a low interest rate environment.

“We can dissect the multiple risks that we see, selecting those with better risk-return potential and move portfolio positioning to capitalize in order to generate excess benchmark returns,” he says. “With a passive strategy, you don’t even get benchmark returns. You get benchmark minus [management expense ratio] returns.”

The risks associated with a passive approach to fixed-income investing “have gone way up,” says Yves Rebetez, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) analyst and chief investment officer at Pascal Financial in Toronto.

That’s in large part because investors are assuming more duration risk as the average term periods of debt held within fixed-income ETFs is lengthening and making investors potentially more vulnerable to interest-rate changes.

Mr. Rebetez sees the appeal for investors to have a fund manager adjusting for credit and duration risk rather than taking a passive approach to fixed-income investing. “The problem is I am not sure I even want to be in that space because of low returns.”

However, lower bond returns are still better than returns generated by holding cash or cash equivalents, Mr. Briggs says.

Story continues below advertisement

While some wary investors have retreated to holding more cash in money market funds or ultra-safe, locked-in investments, such as guaranteed investment certificates (GICs), he worries that strategy is setting them up for disappointment.

“In 2018, cash was the best performing asset, but it was the best performing asset for the first time in 20 years. In 2019, it was the worst performing asset. It lagged fixed income and it really lagged equities,” he says.

As for holding GICs, except for those that are cashable, “you’re locked in with zero liquidity. It is a trade-off for safety but if it allows some investors to sleep better it is understandable,” he adds.

For investors looking for better fixed-income returns and liquidity than those offered by GICs but with more safety than a pure fixed-income fund, a short-duration bond fund, which invests in debt of two to three years, on average, is a good option, Mr. Briggs suggests.

“You are able to get better than cash returns,” he says. “It kind of wedges in between a pure no-risk GIC and a bond fund return. You don’t have a lot of volatility, generally, with a short duration bond fund.”

SUPPLIED

Financial advisors and investors will likely have to take on more risk in their investment portfolios in the coming decade if they want to achieve the rates of return they have been accustomed to over the past 20 years.

That’s because the annual returns in a range of asset classes that are core to Canadian portfolios – including Canadian equities, government and investment-grade bonds – are projected to be lower over the next seven to 10 years, according to money managers at Franklin Templeton Investments Corp. They presented some of the key insights from the firm’s Capital Market Expectations report at its 2020 Global Investment Outlook event in Toronto last month.

To produce the report, the firm examined the expected rates of returns of more than 50 asset classes by looking closely at a variety of factors, from historical risk premia, economic growth and inflation prospects to debt levels, populism and how policy-makers are expected to respond to the next economic downturn.

Story continues below advertisement

Notably, Franklin Templeton predicts that Canadian government and investment-grade corporate bonds will lag past rates of return dramatically. That means advisors and investors will likely have to adopt a more aggressive asset mix to meet their goals, said William Yun, the firm’s executive vice-president of multi-asset solutions in New York, at the event.

“If you are looking just at your typical 60-40 equities-fixed income portfolio, you may not be able to achieve your required rates of return,” he warned, noting that such an asset mix would only produce returns of slightly more than 4 per cent.

Thus, he recommended that advisors and investors adopt a “multi-faceted approach” to achieve better returns.

“There are different asset classes, different ways to achieve a return for clients that meet their risk objectives rather than just staying with Canadian equities and Canadian fixed-income,” Mr. Yun said.

That means adding more U.S., international and emerging-markets equities and corporate bonds, and even more alternative assets, such as hedge funds, to the mix.

He notes that the asset mix “depends on each investor, their risk tolerance and time horizon. But, in general, in this low inflationary environment … you may have to consider alternative asset classes.”

As such, advisors and investors might consider other non-traditional assets, such as real estate, to produce superior returns.

Story continues below advertisement

Franklin Templeton’s outlook predicts that “the global economic environment will be supportive of risk assets” over the next seven years, which should help those advisors and investors who adopt a more diversified and multi-asset portfolio.

Overall, the firm predicts moderate global growth with low inflation, but more near-term volatility.

The firm remains positive on emerging markets, noting that growth potential should lead to outperformance over developed-market equities and bonds.

In developed markets, Franklin Templeton expects that equities have greater performance potential than bonds.

Specifically, the firm is overweight on U.S. equities, based on the ability of the U.S. central bank to cut interest rates further if required and a resurgent U.S. consumer, who is enjoying higher wages and employment, and a rising net worth.

Open this photo in gallery Ian Riach, a senior portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton, is underweight Canadian equities and maintains a ‘fairly cautious view’ on Canadian economy. SUPPLIED

Mr. Yun noted that U.S. retail sales are “very strong and if you have even a mildly confident consumer that is spending in the U.S. – where consumption is about two-thirds of the economy – that is another positive sign in terms of its economic outlook.”

Story continues below advertisement

As for north of the border, Franklin Templeton money managers recommend investors underweight Canadian equities in the coming year, and they hold a neutral approach to Canadian government and investment-grade bonds.

“We have a fairly cautious view on the Canadian economy given some of the cyclical and structural challenges,” said Ian Riach, Toronto-based senior vice-president and portfolio manager, Franklin Templeton multi-asset solutions, at the event.

He pointed to rising manufacturing inventories and declining capital investments and corporate profits, plus a heavily indebted Canadian consumer, who may be running out of borrowing capacity.

It’s estimated that Canadians currently owe $1.75 for every dollar in income that they generate, almost double the 90 cents owed per dollar earned in 1990. By comparison, U.S. consumers have cut their debt since the recession of a decade ago and are in better shape financially.

“With consumer debt at high levels and maybe the negative implications that it can have for banks, and challenges within the resource sectors, the Canadian economy is vulnerable,” Mr. Riach said.

That includes not just the energy industry, but also the mining and forestry industries, which face challenges because of trade disputes and a global slowdown.

Story continues below advertisement

He noted that corporate fundamentals in the form of profit margins and earnings per share are “not dire but are weakening,” while there are policy hurdles to foreign investment in the form of perceived high business tax rates and excessive bureaucracy in Canada.

Canadian equities are priced “fairly attractively” compared with those in the U.S. and their long-term averages, but Mr. Riach is not recommending a buying spree, noting that markets can stay undervalued for long periods.

“Despite valuations being very attractive, we think Canadian equities are vulnerable to further disappointment,” he said.

Yader Guzman/The Globe and Mail

Ontario Premier Doug Ford says the province’s teachers unions must be flexible as his government seeks major changes to the Toronto District School Board’s pandemic reopening plan just three weeks before classes begin.

Last week, the Ontario government rejected plans from the Toronto board, the country’s largest, that would have reduced class sizes in elementary schools and shaved 48 minutes of teaching time off each school day to preserve contractually guaranteed preparation time for teachers.

Now, the province is asking teachers to be flexible on their preparation time in order to maximize in-class instruction – a demand the government says teacher unions refuse to discuss.

The confrontation echoes the bitter, drawn-out contract talks that just ended in the spring, as COVID-19 hit.

Speaking to the media on Monday, Mr. Ford accused the unions of failing to work with the government and mounting political attacks. Union leaders say they have been flexible, and that Mr. Ford is trying to deflect blame for the confusion over school reopening plans.

“I’m begging the teachers unions. Like, just work with us. Like man, come on. We work with everyone, absolutely everyone,” Mr. Ford said.

He added that his government has listened to the unions’ concerns, announcing millions in new funding for better ventilation in schools, enhanced cleaning and allowing the use of school board reserve funds to hire more teachers.

“Anything you ask, we do. We ask for a little bit more, and you shoot it down. It’s just not fair,” the Premier said.

Asked if the government wants teachers to prepare on their own time, Education Minister Stephen Lecce called on the unions to make sacrifices, as others have, noting that many people have lost their jobs or had to change how they work.

“What we’re asking for is flexibility,” Mr. Lecce said. “Every single subsect of society has had to be flexible, changed their behaviour, adapted, pivoted, to really rise to the challenge, which is a generational, once-in-a-century pandemic.”

The Ford government has also told the TDSB to rework its plan for high schools, which included a hybrid of in-class and online learning, with 25 per cent of time in a classroom. Ontario says it wants that number at 50 per cent.

Union leaders insist they are being flexible, and that the issue of prep time hadn’t come up before.

The Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario said it “did not get far enough in the discussions” to talk about preparation time with the Ministry of Education or the Ontario Public School Boards’ Association. In a statement, the union declined to comment further on the Premier’s remarks.

Harvey Bischof, president of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation (OSSTF), described the government’s comments on the lack of union flexibility as “patently false.” He said that since the government downloaded planning to school boards, the provincial union has given more authority to its locals and told the government it is prepared to approve local changes to the central collective agreement “where that is constructive.”

He added that Mr. Lecce’s “efforts to continue to blame the unions for his incompetence are frustrating and counterproductive.”

Leslie Wolfe, president of OSSTF Toronto, said the government is simply looking to shift blame, especially as parents and educators grow more anxious about the return to school.

“The problem is this government has tried to create a school reopening plan on the cheap,” Ms. Wolfe said.

Educators use preparation time to plan lessons, mark assignments, liaise with special-education teachers, respond to parents and even to help individual students. Elementary teachers receive 240 minutes every five days. High-school teachers receive 75 minutes a day, although some of that time could be used to cover a class for an absent teacher or supervise cafeterias or hallways.

A draft discussion document on reopening that circulated between the government, school boards’ association and the unions earlier this month included some language on preparation time.

The document, marked confidential and obtained by The Globe and Mail, said that in some circumstances, teachers could be asked to use prep time to cover for absent staff.

“Lost preparation time can be ‘paid back’ and it is noted that an extended period of time may be required to compensate for the lost preparation time,” the document said.

Canada’s first research institute dedicated to studying pandemics will help to address the biggest questions about the current global outbreak of disease – and aims to be prepared for the next one.

On Wednesday, the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto will launch the Institute for Pandemics, which will study how pandemics arise and how to mitigate their effects on health systems and economies.

The institute is supported by a $1-million grant from the Vohra-Miller Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in Toronto.

Adalsteinn Brown, dean of the Dalla Lana School, said pandemics touch on every aspect of life – and in order to create effective health care systems and policies to deal with them, experts from a broad range of fields must be included. But until now, no facility existed in Canada to bring them all together in one place.

It’s why the institute will focus on a holistic approach that brings together epidemiologists, biostatisticians, doctors, nurses, economists, social workers and more. They will work with other institutions and the government of Canada to inform health and economic policy.

“We want to be able to take a Canadian perspective,” Dr. Brown said. “This will allow us to answer important questions ... everything from the sort of masks to use, through to the issue of inequity and who the pandemic is affecting.”

Jennifer Gibson, a bioethics expert with the Institute for Pandemics and director of the University of Toronto’s Joint Centre for Bioethics, said while pandemics have long been an important topic of study in public health, experts weren’t fully prepared for the broad effects of this year’s novel coronavirus.

“Many of our health systems had influenza pandemic plans, and a lot of those had been sitting on the shelf for a period of time. ... None of us really had the experience to know what a total societal response would look like,” she said. “We’ve learned a lot, and this [institute] is a response to the need for that learning.”

Dr. Brown said that in the short term, the experts will focus on how to best move forward in the face of a possible second wave of COVID-19. They’ll address such issues as border closings, how to send children back to school, or the best practices for wearing masks.

But the prospect of another global pandemic is not a question of if, but when, Dr. Gibson said. So while the coronavirus pandemic will be the focus of study in the short term, the aim of the institute is also to be ready for future global contagions, which may not be a long way off.

“This is not the only pandemic that we will experience,” Dr. Gibson said. “We have an opportunity right now to take stock of what we’ve learned so far from this COVID-19 experience and ask ourselves how we may do things differently that would minimize the adverse consequences for particular populations within our society.”

In Ottawa, Chrystia Freeland was sworn in as the new Finance Minister, replacing Bill Morneau – who announced he is stepping down from cabinet and his Toronto Centre seat – as the government announced it will prorogue Parliament until September.

Yesterday, Morneau resigned but said he was not pushed out by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Mr. Morneau says long-term leadership is necessary to guide the country’s finances through an extended and challenging recovery from the pandemic. Morneau said he does not intend to run in the next federal election.

Today, the Prime Minister announced the federal government will prorogue Parliament, to return with a Speech from the Throne followed by a confidence vote on September 23. Documents related to the now-cancelled WE Charity contribution agreement will still be released.

With prorogation, all legislation and committee work dies. However, existing bills and committee studies are not necessarily ended for good, as MPs can approve motions that will reinstate bills and studies back to the stages they were at at the time of prorogation.

At a news conference on Parliament Hill, Mr. Trudeau said a reset is required for the government to help the country recover from the impacts of the pandemic. The prorogation is about gaining or testing the confidence of the House, he added.

Watch: The World Health Organization has said it is concerned that COVID-19 spread is being driven by people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, many of whom are unaware they have been infected.

Coronavirus and business

The end of the CERB will leave a large number of unemployed workers with less generous benefits, potentially reducing consumer spending and adding uncertainty to Canada’s economic recovery.

Several economists project that hundreds of thousands of people will receive less than the $500 provided weekly under the CERB, a shift that could mean a slowdown in the pace of recovery.

The government aims to get more people to accept work that is available, without harming those who still need some degree of support – moving people off the CERB and on to an expanded EI program, or a “parallel benefit.”

Low-wage workers have been disproportionately hurt by the pandemic, with their employment dropping by 14.6 per cent from February to July, compared to a 2.6-per-cent drop for all other paid employees.

“With [Morneau’s] Monday resignation as Finance Minister, it will fall to Chrystia Freeland to convince financial markets that Ottawa has a serious plan to prevent a record deficit from becoming the new normal.” Robyn Urback: “So, Mr. Morneau instead delivered a cheap and unconvincing story about how Canada needs a finance minister for a long-term recovery, and since he never intended to run for more than two elections, the appropriate time for him to resign was now: just 10 months after campaigning for re-election, in the middle of a global pandemic.”

Joe Gosnell, a renowned treaty negotiator, politician and leader of the Nisga’a Nation, has died at the age of 84.

The Nisga’a Lisims government said Tuesday that Mr. Gosnell died in his home in New Aiyansh after a long battle with cancer.

Mr. Gosnell was a hereditary Nisga’a chieftain of the Eagle Clan and was president of the nation when it finalized a landmark treaty in 2000 that gave the First Nation control over its land including forestry and fishing rights. It was the first modern-day treaty signed in B.C. since the 1800s.

Story continues below advertisement

Nisga’a Nation President Eva Clayton said Mr. Gosnell’s wisdom, dignity and determination helped lead the First Nation into self-government over its territory northeast of Prince Rupert.

“Today, we have lost a giant,” Ms. Clayton said in a statement. “His legacy will help shape the project of reconciliation for generations to come.”

Mr. Gosnell was admitted to both the Order of Canada and the Order of B.C., and held an honorary doctorate of laws from Royal Roads University in Victoria.

He leaves his wife of 64 years, Audrey, their seven children and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Mr. Gosnell grew up in the Nass River Valley in B.C.‘s northwest. He worked as a commercial fisherman, carpenter and traditional carver before he was elected as a band councillor and chief of the Gitlaxt’aamiks Band, one of the Nisga’a village governments.

Mr. Gosnell was appointed chancellor of the University of Northern B.C. last year and served until his death.

University interim president Geoffrey Payne said Mr. Gosnell’s dedication to education was evident during his time as chancellor.

“The world has lost a tremendous leader, a man who repeatedly demonstrated a love for his community, his people, education and a commitment to enhancing the lives of others,” Dr. Payne said in a statement.

Ms. Clayton said Mr. Gosnell’s work to negotiate the Nisga’a Treaty produced a “beacon of hope” for people around the world.

“His focus was always on what the Nisga’a, British Columbians and Canadians can achieve together,” she said.

When a bill to accept the treaty was introduced in the legislature in December, 1998, Mr. Gosnell told the house the agreement proved to the world that reasonable people can sit down and settle historical wrongs.

“It’s a triumph because under the treaty, we will no longer be wards of the state, no longer beggars in our own land. It’s a triumph because under the treaty, we will collectively own approximately 2,000 square kilometres of land, far exceeding the postage-stamp reserve set aside for us by colonial governments.”

He said the treaty proved that negotiations – not lawsuits, blockades or violence – are the most effective and honourable way to resolve Aboriginal issues.

Story continues below advertisement

“It’s a triumph, I believe, that signals the end of the Indian Act, the end of more than a century of humiliation, degradation and despair for the Nisga’a Nation.”

Premier John Horgan said in a tweet that everyone can learn from Mr. Gosnell’s legacy of working to make life better for people and that he’ll be missed.

“He was instrumental in helping the Nisga’a chart a new path of self-governance through BC’s first modern treaty.”

The nation said funeral arrangements will be announced by the family."

Finance Minister Bill Morneau resigns, insists he was not pushed by Trudeau

So the real question that has to be asked is: Does Bill Morneau’s resignation change the channel and take the focus off the WE Charity scandal? Far from it. In fact, it probably leaves many in the financial sector wondering exactly what lies ahead for Canada. It is extremely rare for a finance minister to resign in the middle of a crisis. -HeavyJetCaptain

I watched the press conference. He took it like a man, I respect that.

Having said that, I believe he was one Canada’s weakest finance ministers in recent history, he was certainly no Jim Flaherty or Paul Martin.

However, he was by far the best Justin Trudeau had for the position. With such a thin bench, I cannot see how this will work well for Canadians. –Uncle Fester

Bill Morneau is resigning as the federal minister of finance and a Liberal MP. Morneau says he is putting his name forward as a candidate to be the next secretary general of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Canadian Press

Nice. In other news: “Captain Edward Smith has announced that the White Star Line vessel RMS Titanic will be returning to Southampton – its port of origin – after striking an iceberg off the coast of Newfoundland late last night. Captain Smith expects that the return to port will be ‘uneventful.‘ ” –Calgary Republican

While he’s obviously made some mistakes, Bill Morneau is at least a serious person with real experience. I’d rather those people remain in cabinet than out. I’d prefer if it was the Prime Minister who resigned instead. –POPDAD19

The Liberal vessel of governance is ablaze and Canada’s future is burning with it.

Bill Morneau is headed for a Liberal Party lifeboat while Justin Trudeau remains on the bridge with his dedicated crew of progressive activists, steering a course toward a fiscal reef that is about to tear the bottom out of Canada’s economy.

It is unlikely this crew is about to go down with the ship, but there will be precious little succour for Canadians left to founder in the cold sea of financial disaster awaiting them. –sanctimonious

I supported the CERB – even the very weak eligibility controls. It was necessary in a crisis and cost a lot of money. Since then, the government has shown a desire to slosh money around without restraint. The payment to seniors – generally people with fixed incomes unchanged by COVID-19 – was unneeded and inexplicable. The whole WE Charity mess was worse.

I am not concerned about the apparent connections between Justin Trudeau and WE so much as the apparent lack of understanding that the money can run out. Canada is not Greece, and we have a manageable debt-to-GDP ratio. Even with a $343-billion deficit, we are not in bad shape. However, adding in provincial debts does make for a scarier scenario. Our government should understand that there is an eventual wall and stop sloshing money around to non-crisis recipients.

Story continues below advertisement

Also, all of this debt needs to be repaid – either through future taxes or the destructive effects of inflation. I am not sure Mr. Trudeau understands this. –michaelgreason

The political crisis of Bill Morneau’s resignation shows the Liberals at their worst

From my position, it appears Justin Trudeau’s vision of the future involves spending more money – lots more money, and Bill Morneau was reluctant to go along. Looks like the big spenders won the day. So I wonder: What does Mr. Trudeau want to spend more money on? How will the NDP view his vision? I think it’s time to be afraid. Very, very afraid. –BMracek

“Which leaves it up to the NDP. The party isn’t ready for an election. But how could Leader Jagmeet Singh prop up a government in such turmoil?”

Mr. Singh wields a lot of power in this minority government. He will likely prop up Justin Trudeau in exchange for even more deficit spending and higher taxes (the kind that will discourage investment and innovation needed for economic recovery).

Mr. Trudeau will likely get another free pass from voters and from the NDP, and this pattern will continue until the Conservatives can connect with younger voters. –billy112

Story continues below advertisement

This is par for the course for the Liberals. The voters sent them out to the wilderness for three straight election cycles because they couldn’t stop generating problems. It took them embracing Justin Trudeau to get back in the game.

Now it’s the Conservatives’ turn in the wilderness because of pretty much the same problem. Stephen Harper started thinking he was infallible, then the voters turfed him.

This is politics. It’s a vipers pit, and most voters learn quickly to cast a jaundiced eye to the whole process. –Since When

Each long-term care home in Quebec will have a single person responsible and accountable for its response to COVID-19, Health Minister Christian Dube said Tuesday as he moved to shore up the vulnerable sector ahead of a potential second wave of the novel coronavirus.

Health-care staff will also be prevented from working in more than one seniors centre and unknowingly carrying the virus into multiple facilities, the health minister said.

Speaking to reporters in Quebec City, Dube said the government was giving itself six weeks to execute the multi-pronged action plan he announced Tuesday that he said will ensure a swifter, more nimble response if cases rise again.

Many of the measures to be put in place by the end of September are aimed at avoiding a second disaster in the long-term care sector, which accounted for the bulk of the province’s 5,727 deaths attributed the virus.

A key component of the plan is to name a manager who will lead each of the province’s roughly 400 long-term care homes. Quebec Premier Francois Legault has said that at the beginning of the pandemic, one person was often responsible for multiple long-term care facilities, creating confusion and diffusing accountability.

The new managers, who will each be assisted by an infection-control specialist, will be responsible for ensuring government directives are followed. “I don’t want any more excuses that it’s not clear,” Dube said.

He promised that managers who do not follow directions would face consequences, although he did not say what they would be.

Dube stressed that the existing managers of long-term care homes were not responsible for the failures of the first wave, which exposed the weaknesses of a system he described as fragile and under-resourced.

Rather, he said, many managers were unable to respond to the pandemic due to a combination of staff shortages, lack of training and infection control, and directives that were unevenly applied, all of which he expects the new plan to address.

“The elected officials as well as the managers will be accountable,” he said. “But what we want to do with the action plan, with the amounts we’re talking about, is to have managers and elected officials to work with the right tools.”

Dube’s strategy also includes rapid mass testing, maintaining access to surgeries, and ensuring the province has enough medical equipment to cover a potential second wave.

“With the virus, our best weapon is agility and speed,” he said.

Dube also announced an additional $106 million for public health, which will allow regional health establishments to hire some 1,000 full-time workers to help with contact tracing, infection control and administering an eventual vaccine.

The government has already hired 10,000 orderlies, who are expected to enter the work force in the next few weeks.

Seniors Minister Marguerite Blais said Tuesday many of the elements of the action plan will have a lasting positive effect on the long-term care sector. She said the government will present a longer-term policy on the seniors facilities this fall.

Meanwhile, Quebec reported on Tuesday 46 new COVID-19 cases and six additional deaths linked to the novel coronavirus.

Story continues below advertisement

The number of hospitalizations remained unchanged at 145 while the number of people in intensive care increased by two to 27.

Quebec has been by far the hardest-hit Canadian province, with 61,252 COVID-19 infections since the beginning of the pandemic.

While new cases have been declining in recent weeks, Dube warned the virus is still circulating in the province.

He said the current “period of calm” was not a sign the virus was gone, but rather a chance to prepare for a likely rise in infections in the fall.

Dube said Quebec has successfully contained recent outbreaks, suggesting the province is better prepared to move quickly if a second wave comes.

The World Health Organization has said it is concerned that the coronavirus spread is being driven by people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, many of whom are unaware they have been infected, posing a danger to vulnerable groups. Reuters

In less than a month, millions of kids will return to school. What do parents need to know?



Join André Picard and Nicole MacIntyre for a live Q&A on Aug. 19

Allison O’Grady decided to send her sons back to school this fall online – an option her family did not want. But with few details available about the measures being taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in her children’s classrooms in Edmonton, Ms. O’Grady felt forced to choose before she was ready.

“I’m frustrated because I’m being asked to make a really big decision, but without all the information that I need,” she said. “I have to decide by Friday which route we’re going. ... If I saw what it will look like in my kids’ school, then maybe I would feel differently.”

Parents are facing tight deadlines to choose between in-person and remote learning as educators and families try to navigate evolving guidelines for school reopenings. Timelines and options to switch learning models vary among boards, with some requiring students to lock in their decisions for as long as early 2021.

Ms. O’Grady and her husband work full time and need flexibility with school schedules to juggle jobs and family responsibilities. To send their children to school in-person – their preferred option – could require them to work from home on short notice if the school had an outbreak or a child at the school fell ill. They hope the online option will cause less disruption in their sons’ education and their work schedules.

Provincial governments have faced mounting criticism on school reopening plans. Crowded classes, poor funding for staff support and confusing policies on mask use have parents, students and teachers feeling uncertain about safety and the quality of education.

Not all students in Canada will have the option to learn online. Remote classes will be offered at all levels in Ontario and by some boards in Alberta. In British Columbia and Manitoba, parents are urging their provincial governments to provide online options.

Parents say the varying rules and deadlines are confusing. They will have some flexibility to change their minds, but some boards say switching will depend on capacity and timing.

At the Calgary Board of Education, students can move from remote to face-to-face learning in February, but are not permitted to go from in-class to online after Sept. 1. Students at Edmonton schools can switch at the beginning of each new quarter period. The board, Edmonton Public Schools, will allow students to leave in-person classrooms to work at home any time they want to, but they would have to wait until the beginning of the next quarter to join an online class. And Edmonton Catholic Schools, where Ms. O’Grady’s children are enrolled, will not allow students to switch options once school begins until the next quarter.

“If a child becomes ill or there’s a medical reason, of course, we’re going to look at that,” said Tim Cusack, deputy superintendent at ECS. “But we’re asking parents to make a firm commitment to one learning stance or the other, and that is because we need to deploy human resources to make it work.”

Parents in Ontario have a similar dilemma. The Peel District School Board – one of the largest school boards in Canada – asked parents to submit their decision by Aug. 17 and said that after the first week of school, secondary students will not have the option to change until the next quarter. Parents of students in the Toronto District School Board received automated calls last week asking them to choose a learning model, and what their decision would be in the case of current class sizes and in reduced class sizes – an option the province is not funding. The chance to switch will depend on space in classes, according to the TDSB website.

The Peel and Toronto boards did not respond to requests for comment.

While the largest school boards in both provinces have released plans for their districts – which range from 100 to 600 schools – those guidelines could be applied differently depending on classroom circumstances. But many school plans will not be available until late August, when principals and administrative staff return to work, weeks after many parents must finalize their decisions.

In many classrooms, students sit at tables in groups facing each other rather than at traditional desks. To space out seating arrangements, boards have advised schools to remove additional furniture and tools, such as shelves of books and toys, and to convert gyms, libraries and other common areas into classrooms.

The loss of educational instruction in common areas and teaching tools in classrooms could negatively affect student learning, said Dena Haber, a parent and teacher in Toronto.

Ms. Haber’s daughter is starting her first year of kindergarten in September, but it may not be at a school in the TDSB. She said the in-person setup is unsafe, with large classes, and a parent would need to be at home and available to facilitate online learning for the four-year-old, she said. With Ms. Haber returning to the classroom in September, she is considering the difficult decision of enrolling her daughter in a private school.

“I can’t put her in a room with 30 kids with poor ventilation,” she said. “And even beyond the safety issues with the pandemic, I fear the environment that I’m putting my child into.”

British Columbia said in early August that most students will return to school for full-time, in-class learning. Since then, parents have demanded remote learning options, with an online petition racking up 35,000 signatures.

Premier John Horgan said in the legislature on Friday that students and parents that are uncomfortable with the plan can opt for distance learning – an existing program that provides the provincial curriculum through online institutions. But the province would not comment on whether students will need to leave their current schools to do that, which in crowded districts could mean losing a spot if they hope to return.

Mr. Horgan added that students in Vancouver and some districts will announce hybrid plans this week that could include a blend of in-person and remote classes. To find out whether a local school will offer online learning, parents should call their district, the Premier said.

The Vancouver School Board said details of its plan will be released later this week.

The province has given B.C. school districts until Aug. 26 to communicate plans to parents.

Edmond Luk, who launched the online petition, said the short runway for decision-making and lack of remote options has his family considering homeschooling for his seven-year-old daughter, who is supposed to start Grade 3 at a French immersion school in Burnaby. But with his two senior parents at home, sending her to school with a cohort that could have as many as 60 children would put his family at risk, he said.

Mr. Luk inquired about distance learning in Burnaby, but all classes were full. Pulling his daughter out of her school would cost her a spot in one of the few institutions of its kind in the area, he said.

“The government has been very ambiguous in stating that there are options for families, but in fact there are not,” Mr. Luk said. “We’re still on the edge waiting. But if they don’t make any changes before school starts, then I would not put my daughter’s and family’s life in danger.”

Weak response to Hong Kong crisis could embolden Beijing on Taiwan, MPs told

Members of Parliament were warned Monday that an insufficient response from Canada to the Hong Kong crisis could help embolden China to one day move against Taiwan.

Evan Medeiros, an American scholar who served on the National Security Council in Barack Obama’s administration, cautioned MPs that he did not regard Beijing’s crackdown on Hong Kong as a prelude to military action against Taiwan. But, he said, China will certainly be taking inventory of how much blowback it received for restricting political freedoms in Hong Kong.

MOMENT IN TIME: AUGUST 18, 1886

Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images

Helium is discovered

Helium, the gas that keeps party balloons aloft, is the second most common element in the universe. But until 1868, no one had any idea it existed. Then came the great solar eclipse of Aug. 18, which swept across India and Southeast Asia. Astronomers were keen to study the event with a new tool called the spectroscope, which separates light into its constituent colours. Norman Pogson, director of the Madras Observatory, was one of the few to notice a glowing yellow line in the spectrum of the sun’s atmosphere that he observed during the eclipse. Such lines are produced by different chemical elements, but this one did not correspond to any known substance. French astronomer Pierre Janssen was also watching from India and later learned how to spot the same line without having to wait for an eclipse. So did Norman Lockyer, a British civil servant-turned-scientist and founder of the journal Nature. By year’s end, Lockyer and Janssen believed the mysterious line represented a new element. Lockyer proposed calling it “helium” after Helios, the sun god of ancient Greece. Not until 1895 did chemists provide earthly confirmation of helium – the first and only element discovered in space.

British Columbia will require staff and students in middle and secondary schools to wear masks in common areas and on school buses when classes resume, a shift from the original plan, which had masks recommended but not mandatory.

The change came after British Columbia tabulated one of its highest-ever counts of new cases, 236 since Saturday. Public health officials say most cases are among young adults.

Under the new guidelines for schools issued on Monday, masks will be required in the higher grades when students and teachers are outside their classrooms in crowded common areas such as the hallway or the bus. They will also be mandatory any time students and teachers cannot maintain an appropriate distance from others outside of their learning groups. School districts are dividing students into cohorts of no more than 60 in elementary school and 120 in high-school.

Back to school: When do school open? Are masks mandatory? A guide

Reka Gustafson, the deputy Provincial Health Officer, told reporters at Monday’s COVID-19 briefing that masks generally don’t offer a high level of protection from the virus.

“That’s why, when we do recommend them, they’re limited to the settings where usually, during brief periods of time, the other control methods cannot be used,” Dr. Gustafson said.

She said the current science shows children are not “very efficient transmitters of COVID-19″ and that it has been uncommon for adults to get the virus from working in schools.

“We have a lot of reassuring data from around the world that is telling us it’s possible to be safe,” she said.

Ontario has announced students in Grade 4 and up will be required to wear masks, including in class, while younger students will be encouraged to do the same. Alberta is requiring masks for students Grade 4 and up in common areas, but not in class for working at their desks. Quebec has done the same for students in Grade 5 and up. Nova Scotia is requiring them for high-school students in common areas.

On Friday, Calgary’s two main school boards imposed the strictest rules in the country, requiring face coverings beginning in kindergarten and, for students in the city’s public school system, in classrooms during lessons.

Last week, B.C.‘s Provincial Health Officer, Bonnie Henry, defended the province‘s earlier decision not to make masks mandatory. She said masks can interfere with students’ ability to learn, but they can help where physical distancing cannot be maintained, such as in hallways.

“It is a challenge. To think of, particularly a young child, 10, 11, 12, sitting all day in a classroom with a mask on is probably not realistic,” she said. “There’s lots of things we can do to make those environments safe without requiring someone to sit with a mask on for long periods of time.”

The Public Health Agency of Canada developed guidelines, released last weekend in collaboration with public health experts, that recommend non-medical masks for children at the age of 10 – around Grade 4 – and older based on current evidence of COVID-19 transmission.

On Monday, the education ministry said students who can’t wear masks for medical reasons will be exempt from the updated health and safety guidelines.

B.C.‘s schools are scheduled to open on Sept. 10.

B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix says the province will announce stricter penalties this week for those who flout public-health rules as COVID-19 cases climb in the region. The Canadian Press

The B.C. education ministry also said on Monday it is providing additional funding to schools to help pay for up to 1.5 million non-medical masks. The money would provide for at least two masks for every staff member and student at the province’s public schools.

A spokesperson for the ministry said it is also giving school districts new technical guidelines and checklists developed by industry experts to help improve the ventilation in classrooms.

The BC Teachers’ Federation did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday, but has said it prefers a stricter mask policy.

The government also says it is increasing the cleaning of things like doorknobs, keyboards, desks and chairs.

As well, students, staff and visitors will be required to clean their hands before boarding school buses or entering schools. Hands will also have to be cleaned before and after eating, when using washrooms and playground equipment.

New Brunswick will become the first province to head to the polls during the COVID-19 crisis, as Premier Blaine Higgs tries to turn support for his handling of the pandemic into a majority government.

Mr. Higgs called the election Monday afternoon, after the opposition Liberals rejected a proposed four-party deal last week that would have avoided an election for two years. The Premier says an election is needed to give his province stability, and sees the Sept. 14 vote as his best chance at securing a majority.

His minority Progressive Conservative government, elected in 2018, holds 20 seats in the legislature, the same as the Liberals. The People’s Alliance of New Brunswick and the Green Party both hold three, while two seats are vacant and one is held by an independent MLA.

It will be the first time voters head to polling stations in Canada during COVID-19 restrictions, with rules around gathering and physical distancing in public settings. The Premier said he called the election only after the province’s chief medical officer of health advised an election could be held safely next month.

The Premier, who took office after former Liberal premier Brian Gallant’s government failed to win the confidence of the legislature following an inconclusive election, was also facing three by-elections this fall that could have cost his party its tentative hold on power.

Recent opinion polls have favoured the Higgs government, which until now had been getting unprecedented co-operation from the other parties during the pandemic. But calling an election at this time remains a gamble, with both political and public-health risks, observers say.

“In normal times, it would make sense to roll the dice, but the risks involved are different here,” said J.P. Lewis, a political scientist at the University of New Brunswick.

“When premiers and prime ministers have gone to the polls early, it’s not unusual for that to be a story. But none of those have been during a time when there could be a stay-at-home order.”

The Premier acknowledged many conventional campaign methods will be off-limits to candidates.

“We are in a pandemic and the coming election campaign will not be like any election we have ever experienced,” Mr. Higgs told reporters Monday.

Story continues below advertisement

Candidates will need to be creative and innovative to get out the vote during the 28-day campaign while following health directives to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Premier said.

“As difficult as it is to imagine, our candidates will not be going door-to-door and they will not be leaving any hand-delivered papers or brochures on your doorstep,” Mr. Higgs said.

Liberal Leader Kevin Vickers, the former Canadian ambassador to Ireland and sergeant-at-arms of the House of Commons of Canada, said calling an election during a pandemic was a power grab that needlessly endangers voters.

“New Brunswickers are in an election they do not need or want,” he said. “The Premier of New Brunswick chose political opportunism instead of the health and safety of our citizens.”

The election will also be Mr. Vickers’s first big test, with a narrow path to victory that will require stealing back seats in the largely conservative south, while holding onto francophone support in the province’s northern regions.

The Liberal Leader seized on language divisions in the province – a well-worn critique of Mr. Higgs’s government among some French-speaking Acadians – as well as environmental concerns and persistent economic challenges in rural areas in his pitch to voters.

Story continues below advertisement

Green Party Leader David Coon argued holding a general election is not in the public’s best interests.

“The vast majority of people don’t want to have an election in times of pandemic. People’s fears and concerns about the health of their families are very justified and legitimate and we understand them,” he said.

The Premier said the election timing makes sense because of a lull in cases that presents a window of opportunity. The opposition points out the 15 active cases in the province, including six added over the weekend, are the worst since an outbreak in June.

On the whole, however, New Brunswick has fared batter than most provinces when considering the human toll from COVID-19. It’s had 186 confirmed cases and two deaths since the pandemic began. Its economy has also been reopened for months – by the end of June, it boasted that more than 70 per cent of small businesses were up and running again, more than any other province.

Mr. Higgs is attempting to end the turnstile pattern of the premier’s office in his province, by doing something no New Brunswick premier has been able to do since Bernard Lord in 2003 – win a re-election bid.

Jean Robert Ngola Monzinga became the subject of public outrage in May when Premier Blaine Higgs said an “irresponsible” medical professional brought the coronavirus into the small community of Campbellton. The doctor’s identity soon leaked on social media.

The outbreak has caused two deaths and dozens of infections. Dr. Ngola has denied being its source.

On July 8, the RCMP served Dr. Ngola with a notice to appear in court on Oct. 26 to face a charge of failing to comply with an order under the province’s Emergency Measures Act, which the Premier invoked in March to combat the pandemic.

The doctor’s lawyer, Joel Etienne, confirmed on Monday that he had received the notice, and said Dr. Ngola is innocent. He also noted that the charge is not criminal but “regulatory” and closer in nature to a “traffic ticket.”

“Jean Robert is not patient zero, Jean Robert did not do anything illegal, Jean Robert did not break any provincial legislation,” Mr. Etienne said. “Jean Robert should not have been singled out and scapegoated.”

The controversy stems from a trip to Quebec that Dr. Ngola took during the week of May 10. The family physician had to pick up his daughter from a Montreal suburb when her mother left the country for a family emergency. On his return trip, he stopped in the city of Trois-Rivières to meet with two fellow doctors about future work in the province.

When he returned to New Brunswick, he did not self-isolate but returned to work at the Campbellton Regional Hospital the next day, out of a sense of obligation to his patients, he said in a June interview. He later tested positive for COVID-19, as did at least one of his patients.

Provincial policy requires health care workers who live and work in New Brunswick to self-isolate for 14 days if they return from outside of the province. There are exceptions for those who live across the border in Quebec and, in some cases, for health professionals coming from outside the province to work temporarily in New Brunswick.

Mr. Etienne argued that because health workers entering the province with no quarantine was routine at the time, Dr. Ngola did nothing wrong.

“He fell within the ambit of the law, he followed the protocols that were in place, and he was diligent in every step that he took,” Mr. Etienne said.

Dr. Ngola has said that the accusation “destroyed” his life amid threats to his safety and racial abuse. He is now working as a doctor in a small town in Quebec.

The Canadian Press

At a time of unprecedented scrutiny on the costs of policing, Toronto’s police board will vote Tuesday on whether to give the city’s auditor-general increased access to the service’s finances – a move city councillors say would allow a more thoughtful debate on the future of Canada’s largest municipal police force.

The recommendation was among more than 80 that came in reports done in recent months aimed at tackling systemic anti-Black racism and rethinking the force’s response to mental-health emergencies. It also calls for a line-by-line breakdown of the $1.2-billion police budget to be made public instead of the summary currently available.

“The reality is that today, and every year before, Toronto council votes on a budget that is over a billion dollars without even the ability to see the line-by-line budget,” City Councillor Josh Matlow said. “And so [this] will hopefully change that … because then we can actually have a really substantial discussion around the line-by-line, and then actually debate whether we agree that our money should be invested in A, B and C, but maybe not E.”

Mr. Matlow, who put forward a motion with Councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam in June to increase budget transparency and eventually scale back police funding in Toronto by 10 per cent, praised the mayor and the police board for these recommendations, which are slated to be discussed at Tuesday’s police board meeting.

Although the motion failed, council later passed a revised version, on which many of the recommendations going to the police board are based.

A recent Globe analysis of police spending across the country showed that, in some provinces, funding for police has grown faster than for transit or social services. (In Toronto, about one-tenth of the municipal operations budget goes toward police services. In other cities, forces have accounted for a quarter or more of city spending, with the majority of those funds spent on officers’ salaries.)

“Transparency results in greater accountability and, potentially, savings,” Toronto Police Services Board chair Jim Hart wrote in one report.

Under the City of Toronto Act, Toronto’s auditor-general lacks the power to audit the police force without an invitation. In addition to providing that invitation, the police board is also recommending that Mr. Hart go to the province to express support for an update to that legislation, “to expand the auditor-general’s jurisdiction to include auditing the [police] service, and reporting the results ... to the board.”

The recommendations have piqued the interest of Ken Hughes, Auditor-General for the City of Ottawa. While Toronto has its own act, Ontario’s 443 other municipalities are governed by the Municipal Act, which does not require local governments to establish an auditor-general’s office. Very few have one, Mr. Hughes said, and those that do similarly require an invitation to audit police.

Although municipalities still have an internal audit function, he stresses that this is not the same as an independent auditor. For instance, a municipality’s internal auditor could report to the city manager, and an internal auditor at the police might report to the police chief.

“Every internal audit function is not independent of the administration themselves because they are part of the administration,” he said.

Mr. Hughes said police finances should be audited as standard practice, and questions why municipal police services would be exempt.

The federal auditor-general routinely examines the RCMP to ensure value for money, for example. And Ontario’s auditor-general has scrutinized the provincial police force’s finances.

“Obviously, there are some aspects of police operations that should remain confidential. I think everyone gets that,” Mr. Hughes said. “But where do you draw the line? How do you know if you’re getting value for money if no one is ever asking the appropriate questions or comparing the activities of one police service to the activities of another?”





Mr. Hughes said he is encouraged by the proposal in Toronto, but would like to see the same change made to the Municipal Act, which undergoes mandatory reviews every so often, to address gaps.

“The most accessible government is supposed to be your municipal government. That’s where you expect to see accountability and transparency,” he said. “If there isn’t somebody independent who can help make everything more transparent, then your accountability is lessened.”

Akwasi Owusu-Bempah, a professor of criminology at the University of Toronto, said that financial audits of the police force would be particularly valuable at a time when cities face widespread calls to “defund” police. The idea is to reduce police budgets and direct the savings to social programs. “Taxpayers should be asking for these,” he said. “This is ultimately taxpayer money.”

“It could be [that they could be defunded by] 25 per cent, it could be 5 per cent. But without looking at what they do, and figuring out what they don’t need to be doing and what could be done elsewhere… we have no idea what that figure should be,” he said. “This is why we need the audit.”"

Join André Picard and Nicole MacIntyre for a live Q&A on Aug. 19

With thousands of parents opting not to send their children back to school, the biggest challenges of remote learning will be faced by the smallest students.

When the pandemic hit Canada and in-person classes were cancelled in mid-March, teachers and students of all ages were thrust into a distance learning experiment that many parents consider a failure, with little live teaching, uneven expectations and few standards.

As the first day of school approaches, the Ontario government and many Alberta school boards are allowing families worried about the risk of in-person classes to register children of any age for online learning instead. Depending on where they live, some high-school students will learn from home part of the time.

Explainer: Canada’s back-to-school plans

Ontario government clashes with teachers unions over school reopening plans

Education officials vow remote learning will be better this school year. However, it is not clear how it will work and whether teachers adopting new methods of instruction will be able to overcome the significant challenges of online schooling, especially for elementary students.

Many educators question the value of such instruction for young children, saying it is a poor substitute for direct interaction with a teacher and peers. It also typically means hours of screen time, which child-development experts caution against, does not allow young children to learn through hands-on play nor caters to their short attention spans.

“The younger you go, I think the more you need to look at what can you do offline to learn the skills, knowledge and aptitudes that you’re supposed to cover in that particular grade level,” said Michael Barbour, a professor of instructional design at Touro University California and an expert in distance education.

In order to take part in remote learning, many elementary school children, including those who need help with their work or using a computer, require a parent or caregiver to serve as a learning coach, Prof. Barbour said. As a result, the approach is not an option for many families.

“It’s really home-schooling under the direction of a teacher,” he said. “For all intents and purposes, that’s really what you’re doing.”

The Calgary Board of Education is stressing the role of parents in remote learning, warning in an update this month that the choice “requires a significant commitment from students and parents” and doesn’t “offer the same opportunities or supports as in-person learning.”

In Ontario, which is not mandating smaller class sizes, higher-than-expected numbers of families in some areas are choosing remote learning. While most school boards have not yet provided numbers, the Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board said last week that about 30 per cent of elementary students and 25 per cent of secondary students are already signed up for online schooling.

Under requirements that Education Minister Stephen Lecce says will create “Zoom-style classrooms,” Ontario teachers must provide five hours of “learning opportunities” a day, with at least three hours of live, synchronous learning for children in kindergarten and three hours and 45 minutes for Grades 1 through 8. Teachers must be available throughout the school day, and students will have a combination of synchronous and asynchronous activities, guided instruction, large- and small-group learning and independent work.

Michelle McKay, who taught kindergarten last year, said requiring three hours of live remote instruction a day for kindergarteners is inconsistent with the Ministry of Education’s own early years pedagogy, which focuses on play and inquiry-based learning.

“It’s not developmentally appropriate. It does not align with any type of learning that would happen in the classroom,” said Ms. McKay, who taught in the Peel District School Board and is doing her PhD at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto. “I don’t know how this is setting anybody up for success or setting young children up to love learning.”

After schools closed last spring, Ms. McKay connected with her students in regular one-on-one phone calls because they were easier for parents with more than one child sharing devices and for those who were shift workers. She also used Google Classroom to post suggestions for activities that children could do with their caregivers, including building forts, discussing the steps involved in cooking dinner and identifying numbers on neighbourhood walks.

But she said not being in the same room as her students meant she missed being involved in the process of their learning. When families sent her photos or videos of their children’s work, she had no idea how much time they had spent on the projects, whether they had struggled or if they had gotten help.

“By not being able to experience it live with a child, you’re missing tons of information,” she said.

Although remote learning is not optimal for young children, Wendy Terro, a centrally assigned principal at the Toronto District School Board, said the board is doing all it can to ensure students get a solid education even if they don’t step inside a classroom.

“We would love schools to be back to what they were at the start of last year, but in the situation we’re in, we want to provide the richest remote learning experience we can for our students,” she said.

Ms. Terro said teachers have learned a great deal since last spring, including through professional development sessions.

“It’s important to remember that when we jumped into this in March, a lot of people were starting from scratch, and there’s been tremendous growth,” she said. “As a system, we’ve learned a lot.”

Josée Beaudoin, director of Remote Network Schools, which helps isolated Quebec schools connect virtually, said the idea of providing distance education for young students was largely uncharted territory for Canadian educators when schools shut down.

“It’s new to do remote schooling at the primary level. It’s not normal,” she said. “You know, with these children so young, it was difficult to imagine how that could be done.”

Story continues below advertisement

Teachers assigned to remote classrooms this fall will need to be creative and develop strategies to overcome several challenges, Ms. Beaudoin said.

The first is figuring out which technology to use while setting standards for how the class will work together virtually, she said.

Remote educators also need to do detailed planning, she said, both for the material they will cover and to create a sense of community by encouraging children to interact with each other.

“At the primary level, this issue of interactions between students for learning is extremely important. So you have to plan these moments and to organize your tools to do so,” she said. “Learning is a social activity.”

In addition, teachers need to communicate with parents to share their learning plan, online schedule, expectations for independent work and links to resources.

Above all, Ms. Beaudoin said, teachers should approach remote learning with an open mind – and should not be afraid to make mistakes.

“It’s really new. So for teachers, they don’t have to be experts,” she said. “It’s learning by doing.”

The CFL has cancelled its 2020 season, the first time since 1919 that the Grey Cup won’t be presented.

The CFL cancelled the season after it couldn’t secure financing from the federal government, which the league said was necessary for a shortened season. Without the loan, teams would be facing financial losses, the league said.

In Ottawa, Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced his resignation from the Trudeau cabinet on Monday after reports of tension between him and the Prime Minister bubbled to the surface during recent days.

Mr. Morneau told reporters that he met with the Prime Minister Monday to inform him that he would not be running in the next election. He said he never intended to run in more than two elections.

As a result, he said the next phase of economic recovery will take several years and another finance minister will be needed.

Roughly 1,100 protesters caught up in the largest mass arrests in Canadian history a decade ago are eligible to receive between $5,000 and $24,700 each in the proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit against the Toronto Police Service.

The police service also committed to more appropriate use of crowd-control techniques, such as giving people warnings and a chance to disperse, than they used on mostly peaceful demonstrators during the Group of 20 meetings of world leaders on June 26 and 27, 2010, in Toronto.

The police also agreed to expunge any records of the protesters’ arrest and detention, unless they were charged with an offence. The vast majority were released without charge. The settlement took 10 years to achieve after the two sides fought the lawsuit’s first stage – certification of the class action – to the Supreme Court of Canada, which took six years.

Police did not admit liability, or acknowledge violating protesters’ rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms – although they did promise to respect Charter rights in the future. They also did not entirely forswear the aggressive containment techniques they used in 2010, but said their measures should be proportionate to the risk of harm.

The $16.5-million settlement, if approved by a judge, would bring to a close a widely criticized episode in Canadian policing, when peaceful protesters, and in some cases passersby, were hemmed in by police in riot gear, held in the open for several hours in a relentless downpour, and detained in poor conditions in a makeshift jail.

“It was terrifying,” Sherry Good, the representative plaintiff in the class action, told The Globe and Mail. “It made me very wary of the police. That lasts to today.”

She said she is very happy with the settlement. “The money, of course, is lovely, but it’s the other parts of the settlement that are important to me,” such as commitments to do better in the future.

Lawyers for the protesters, Murray Klippenstein and Eric Gillespie, said the financial settlement is comparable to those reached in similar legal actions in the United States.

“We think most Canadians will recognize that there really have to be limits on police actions, and that this is an example of how not to do things,” Mr. Klippenstein said.

The settlement is to be brought before Ontario Superior Court Justice Edward Belobaba on Oct. 19.

The first day of protests had been marked by violence when black-clad protesters broke away from peaceful demonstrators and burned police cars and broke windows on downtown streets. In response, senior police officers declared that they would take back the streets, said Gerry McNeilly, then Ontario’s independent police review director. He said the actions that followed caused a loss of public confidence in the police.

Lines of riot police boxed in peaceful protesters, a technique known as “kettling,” on crowds along the Esplanade, at Queen Street and Spadina Avenue, the University of Toronto and in Parkdale. In all, roughly 1,100 people were arrested, and large numbers were detained without access to legal counsel, adequate food or water or bathroom privacy, in overcrowded wire cages in a makeshift jail, according to a court document filed on behalf of the protesters in the class action.

The class action, filed that August, sought $45-million in damages from Toronto Police and the federal government (later dropped from the lawsuit), and a court declaration that the police had violated the protesters’ Charter rights.

The proposed settlement does not contain such a declaration. But it does include a commitment to avoid using “containment,” except where necessary to avoid substantial harm to a person, and only after audible warnings have been given, and an opportunity to disperse. Anyone arrested for a breach of the peace must be released as soon as any risk of imminent harm has passed, even if they intend to rejoin a peaceful protest.

If temporary detention facilities are to be used, they should be designed for prompt processing, and they should provide adequate food, water and access to medicine, the document says.

Bill Blair, the federal Public Safety Minister, was Toronto’s police chief at the time. His office declined to comment on the proposed settlement. The Toronto Police Service said in a statement it is pleased to reach a resolution.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau resigned suddenly from the Trudeau cabinet Monday evening, saying he never intended to run in the next election and that a new finance minister is needed to oversee the long-term economic recovery from the pandemic.

The announcement came in the wake of recent reports of tension and policy disagreements between the Finance Minister and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

He said the Prime Minister had not asked him to resign. Mr. Morneau did not directly address the notion that tensions existed.

Mr. Morneau said he intends to put his name forward as the next secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with Mr. Trudeau’s endorsement.

Mr. Trudeau released a statement afterwards praising Mr. Morneau and pledging that Canada will “vigorously support” his OECD campaign. Neither man provided any public indication that they were at odds.

The Prime Minister is planning to announce a new finance minister “shortly,” two senior government officials told The Globe and Mail. The officials, who are not being identified by The Globe because they are not authorized to comment publicly on the matter, said Mr. Morneau’s replacement will not be former Bank of Canada and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who has recently been advising the government in an informal capacity.

Current Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne and Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos are viewed in Ottawa as possible candidates.

The finance minister and his staff are the key point of contact in government for executives at Canada’s largest banks, who have generally forged solid relationships with Mr. Morneau, according to sources familiar with banks’ frequent contact with the Finance Ministry during his tenure. The Globe is not identifying the sources because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

Among bankers, Mr. Morneau was seen as a rare but important voice of restraint and fiscal discipline, serving as a counterbalance to some of the government’s more free-spending instincts, the sources said.

The loss of that voice, in the midst of planning for the next phase of the economic recovery from the pandemic, marks an unsettling turn to many in Canada’s financial sector, they said.

Goldy Hyder, the president and CEO of the Business Council of Canada, said that business leaders thanked Mr. Morneau for his service to Canada and for his commitment to sound public policy over the past five years in extremely challenging circumstances.

“Canada needs strong and steady leadership during these extraordinary times to help ensure a healthy and durable economic recovery,” Mr. Hyder said in a statement while he wished him well for his bid to become the next OECD secretary-general.

Financial market reaction was muted, according to BMO chief economist Doug Porter, who pointed to a momentary decline of 0.2 per cent in the Canadian dollar after the announcement.

“Any serious market reaction is likely to await the announcement of a replacement, and thus any related potential shift in policy direction,” he said in a note.

At the news conference on Parliament Hill, Mr. Morneau told reporters that he met with the Prime Minister earlier in the day to inform him that he would not be running in the next election. That vote is scheduled for the fall of 2023, but could come sooner given that the Liberals only hold a minority of seats in the House of Commons.

Mr. Morneau said he never intended to run in more than two elections and that the next phase of Canada’s economic recovery from COVID-19 requires a finance minister who can oversee the plan over the next several years.

“That’s why I’ll be stepping down as finance minister and as Member of Parliament for Toronto Centre,” he said.

“It’s been a real privilege to have this job. But like any job, there’s a time where you’re the appropriate person in the role, and the time where you have to decide when you’re not the appropriate person in the role.

“Since I’m not running again, since I expect that we will have a long and challenging recovery, I think it’s important that the Prime Minister has, by his side, a finance minister who has that longer-term vision. And so that’s what led me to conclude, during this time period, that it’s appropriate for me to step down.”

He is the only Finance Minister that Mr. Trudeau has had since his government came to power in 2015.

Mr. Trudeau thanked Mr. Morneau for his service, adding that he counted on the minister’s leadership, advice and close friendship over the years.

“Bill, you have my deepest gratitude and I know you will continue making great contributions to our country and for Canadians in the years to come,” Mr. Trudeau said.

Mr. Morneau had yet to release a 2020 budget. Plans to table one in March were shelved as the severity of the pandemic set in. In July, he released a fiscal “snapshot” that revealed the deficit for the current fiscal year is projected to reach $343.2-billion. He said a further update would be released in the fall.

Mr. Morneau entered politics in 2015 after leading Morneau Shepell, the Toronto-based pension-management and employee-benefits company originally founded by his father.

He put his pension expertise to work immediately as finance minister, securing a national agreement with the provinces and territories to expand the Canada Pension Plan, an achievement that had eluded his predecessors. He also played a central role in negotiating the federal government purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline from Kinder Morgan in 2018.

His relationship with Canada’s small-business owners took a major hit however after he announced a package of tax changes in 2017 that many owners felt were unfair, leading the government to back away from several elements of the original plan.

Last Tuesday, The Globe reported that sources said Mr. Trudeau was not committed to keeping Mr. Morneau on as the key architect of the federal government’s economic revival plan after the two clashed over the Finance Department’s policy responses to the COVID-19 crisis.

Insiders said that Mr. Trudeau was uncertain whether Mr. Morneau was the right fit to steer the country into a postpandemic economic recovery.

The Globe did not identify the sources because they were not authorized to speak publicly about Mr. Trudeau’s plans for a cabinet remake that could lead to the departure of Mr. Morneau.

The PMO issued a statement after last week’s Globe report that said Mr. Trudeau had full confidence in his Finance Minister.

Both the Conservatives and the NDP have expressed skepticism about reports of friction between Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Morneau and suggest it is a Liberal attempt to take the public focus off of the WE controversy.

The Ethics Commissioner is investigating Mr. Morneau and Mr. Trudeau over whether they breached the Conflict of Interest Act in relation to a now-cancelled contribution agreement of $543.5-million with the WE Charity that has been the source of a political firestorm for the Liberals this summer.

At a committee hearing into the issue last month, Mr. Morneau revealed that he had reimbursed $41,366 to WE Charity earlier that day for travel expenses that the group covered for personal trips his family took to Kenya and Ecuador in 2017, leading to his second public apology that month related to his involvement with WE.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said that Mr. Morneau’s resignation is further proof of a government in chaos.

Mr. Trudeau’s government is consumed by scandal at a time when Canadians are worried about their health and finances, Mr. Scheer said on Twitter, adding the departure is an attempt to try and save the Prime Minister.

“Scapegoating Morneau does not solve the problem,” he said. “As long as Trudeau is Prime Minister, the corruption will continue.”

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said in a statement that the Liberal government is losing a finance minister at the same time as it’s about to leave millions of Canadians on the Canada Emergency Response Benefit without any idea of how to pay the bills in August.

His party’s ethics critic, Charlie Angus, added that there wouldn’t be a finance minister in the world that steps down in the middle of the biggest crisis of the century and says it is the perfect time to look for other opportunities.

“He took the fall for the Prime Minister and he did it very loyally and he walked the plank,” Mr. Angus said in an interview. “This is about Justin Trudeau’s ethics crisis and it cost him his finance minister just like his last crisis [the SNC-Lavalin affair] cost him his justice minister.”

Former Liberal justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet in the last Parliament over the SNC controversy, said on Twitter that resignation day is a tumultuous day by any measure and for many reasons whether it is voluntary or not.

“I have to think there is more to this story,” she said.

The frayed dynamic between the Prime Minister and his finance minister has been put under the microscope by political insiders who wondered if Mr. Morneau would be able to remain in his post.

Liberals were comparing the situation to the tense relationship between prime minister Jean Chrétien and his finance minister Paul Martin in the 1990s and early 2000s that created deep and long-lasting divisions in the party.

The Prime Minister’s former principal secretary Gerald Butts took to Twitter earlier on Monday to urge his former colleagues to “knock it off” unless they missed losing.

He said Liberals are more lethal to Liberals than are any competing partisans and that Canadians have “little patience for this stuff in the best of times, and these are not those.”

Michele Cadario, a consultant and former deputy chief of staff to Mr. Martin when he was prime minister, said there is always a “healthy tension” between a prime minister and a finance minister, who heads a department that views itself as the defender of the public purse.

“What is something that no one ever wants, and no one should want, is for any of those tensions to surface and for any of the sniping back and forth,” she said.

Ms. Cadario, who along with Jenni Byrne, a former deputy chief of staff to prime minister Stephen Harper, recently formed an organization to help companies recruit more women to boards of directors. After Mr. Morneau’s announcement, Ms. Cadario told the Globe that Ms. Freeland would be an “excellent” choice to replace Mr. Morneau.

“I very much hope that his resignation means Canada will have its first female finance minister,” she said. “It’s past time to crack that glass ceiling.”

British Columbia and Alberta racked up hundreds of new coronavirus infections over the weekend, a surge among young adults that set a new pandemic record in B.C. and has made Edmonton a national hot spot for COVID-19.

B.C., in an effort to stamp out community spread, on Monday said it is examining the legal tools it has to crack down on people partying on private property, a break from the government’s light-handed approach. It counted 236 new cases of COVID-19 over the weekend, bringing active cases to 743, a new high for the Western province. Alberta added 359 new cases on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, bringing the provincial total to 1,132 active cases. The Edmonton region counted 593 active cases as of Sunday, with the number of cases in the capital surpassing those in Montreal by a factor of four, when adjusted for population.

As the number of new cases in Ontario and Quebec, the two hardest-hit provinces in the country, hold steady, the surges among young adults in the West have prompted officials to beg people under 40 to stick to the public-health guidelines. But COVID-19 statistics show they are resisting the recommendations.

“Young people are getting out more,” Donna Wilson, a nursing professor at the University of Alberta, said. “Young adults tend to have confidence that they have the health so even if they catch it, it won’t be serious.”

In British Columbia, Health Minister Adrian Dix told reporters on Monday that while it can be maddening to see beaches and sidewalks of Vancouver’s Granville Strip nightlife area very crowded as they were this past weekend, smaller groups partying indoors pose a much greater public-health risk.

Half of the Vancouver area’s eight public spaces linked to outbreaks currently listed by the local health authority happened at high-end lounges and nightclubs. Three of those, Pierre’s Champagne Lounge, West Oak and the IVY Lounge in Trump International Hotel and Tower have been ordered closed, Mr. Dix said.

The province has already put in new rules limiting guests at Airbnb and other short-term rentals, but is having a harder time stopping people from welcoming groups of friends into their homes at night, Mr. Dix said.

""The places where there's greatest danger is private parties where alcohol is involved and it's inside,"" he said.

The provincial government has been reticent to crack down on indoor events given the importance of respecting a person’s privacy in their own home, which Mr. Dix said “dates back to the Magna Carta.” But these parties are now a driving force in new infections and the Solicitor-General is studying new ways to enforce physical distancing inside private properties, Mr. Dix said.

“Don’t hold private parties,” he said. “Twenty to 40 may be seen as young ... but it’s not young, and the people I’ve met over this weekend understand that and understand their obligation to one another, and to their parents and to their grandparents.”

Deena Hinshaw, Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, last week said her province has not yet determined what is driving the wave of new cases in Edmonton, save for exposure at home. People under the age of 40 accounted for 77 per cent of cases in northeast Edmonton and the median age for infected Edmontonians is 30, she said in her update last Wednesday.

“We have seen in Edmonton, many of our recent cases, have been spread within households,” she said last week. The Edmonton zone added 407 new cases between Aug. 10 and Aug. 16.

There are roughly 52 active cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 in the city of Edmonton, according to Alberta’s data. By way of comparison, the rate of cases on the Island of Montreal clocked in at 13 per 100,000 last week.

The action

Open this photo in gallery Robin Pope of Pope Real Estate Ltd. says two-storey units like this come on the market 'every couple of years.' Pope Real Estate Ltd.

As a concession to the COVID-19 pandemic, masks and hand sanitizer were provided to visitors of this newly renovated corner penthouse. But the seller – an interior designer – resisted suggestions that she accept a deep discount on the price, holding fast to her asking price for two months. After about 40 interested buyers had inspected the space, she finally agreed to an offer $55,500 below asking.

“Because of COVID, there were a lot of people who thought to make a low-ball [offer],” agent Robin Pope said. “But there was no market data to support that, nor was there any market data to support that it was a buyers’ market.

“It was a lovely property, so I was confident we would find someone, and my client also had lots of time and wasn’t prepared to give it away either.”

What they got

Open this photo in gallery The penthouse has polished concrete floors, 21-foot ceilings and a wraparound balcony facing south. Pope Real Estate Ltd.

The Robert Watson Lofts is actually two buildings; one a former commercial building converted into lofts and the other a newly built structure with loft-like units. This 1,434-square-foot space is in the new building, and has polished concrete floors, 21-foot ceilings and a wraparound balcony facing south.

The seller installed a Scavolini kitchen, renovated the two bathrooms and removed a fireplace between the living and dining areas. The second floor has also divided to create two separate bedrooms.

The unit comes with laundry facilities, a storage locker and parking. Monthly fees of $1,108 pay for water and heating, plus recreation amenities, including a rooftop deck.

The agent’s take

Open this photo in gallery The seller installed a Scavolini kitchen. Pope Real Estate Ltd.

“A [two-storey] unit like this would come on the market every couple of years because this was so big. Most of what comes on the market would be smaller,” Mr. Pope said.

“And because the soft lofts are in the rear building, the views were better, so … it had a sweeping 180-degree view from downtown to all of Roncesvalles.”

The back story

Jeanmarie and Chris Hulaj didn’t see themselves as retired. Instead, their new job was renovating their Victorian home – a process that hasn’t truly stopped as they are constantly tinkering with small upgrades.

Purchased five years ago, the house at 14576 Old Simcoe Rd. originally caught the couple’s eyes with its grand details. Despite the ceilings being dropped multiple times, they said they could tell then how high the original ceiling heights were: 11 feet in the lower level and 10 feet in the upper level. Meanwhile, the second floor boasts pine flooring over 140 years old. There is also a curved wall staircase.

“It was a beautiful Victorian house,” said Ms. Hulaj, a retired fashion designer and art teacher.

But it also had plenty of problems, as they would find out after attempting some initial redesign work.

“We were doing a lot of demolition and kept finding out more and more problems with the old house,” said Mr. Hulaj, who used to work in technology, including a stint at The Globe and Mail.

When the interior drywall and those dropped ceilings were removed, it was found that some of the exterior framing was already disintegrating, and there was no real insulation. The house’s galvanized piping and aged wiring also presented a problem with getting insurance. At the same time, the entire upstairs needed new framing because it “was open like a barn with no interior walls at all,” Ms. Hulaj recalled.

As a result, the couple had to replace all the wiring, plumbing, heating, venting and framing, before putting back the drywall and repainting the entire interior of the house.

Open this photo in gallery The extensive renovation involved reframing the home and repainting the entire interior. Lissa Veilleux/Lissa Veilleux (MAC Media)

“We were advised by different people just to sort of patch it up and sell it off as quickly as we could,” Mr. Hulaj said. “We just in good conscience couldn’t do a poor job of that. And we were planning to live here.”

They also couldn’t bear the thought of demolishing the house to build a new one.

“We couldn’t see the math in that one,” Ms. Hulaj said. “Like, why knock down such a beautiful house that has so much potential?”

Instead, they pressed on with their intensive renovation plan. It ultimately took four years, with breaks in between.

The house today

Open this photo in gallery The renovated home now features plenty of room for entertaining. Lissa Veilleux/Lissa Veilleux (MAC Media)

Inside the original Victorian shell, the now-revamped house offers plenty of space for living and entertaining.

There are four bedrooms on the second level, all with their own ensuite bathrooms. On the main floor, the fifth bathroom is attached to a sauna. There is also a spacious formal dining room that can entertain 15 people. Attached to it is a parlour, “a really sweet spot” where the couple likes to spend their evenings playing board games.

But with the couple both being enthusiastic cooks, even dearer to their hearts is the kitchen.

In the 17-by-14-foot room with a hardwood floor, a large granite-top island takes centre stage. The custom cabinetry with solid cherry doors surrounding the space were built by Mr. Hulaj himself.

“We cook in our kitchen almost every night,” Ms. Hulaj said. “We cook a lot of different foods and things that are really time-consuming, so you need a lot of space.”

Besides the main living spaces, there is a loft at the very top of the house and a big workshop space at the back of the detached garage.

The large lot spans 108-by-257 feet and includes an in-ground pool.

“It’s actually quite nice to go and sit around the pool,” Ms. Hulaj said.

“We try to knock off work about three o’clock – the work we’re still doing on the house and everything – and then we’ll just go on the zero-gravity chairs and we’re on vacation.”

Open this photo in gallery The large lot features an in-ground pool. Lissa Veilleux/Lissa Veilleux (MAC Media)

But the couple said all the space was too much for just the two of them, so they decided to profit from their love of cooking and open a bed and breakfast.

They started Century House 1879 B & B last summer by placing their bedrooms on Airbnb. With more than 100 bookings since, Ms. Hulaj said they have received mainly compliments about the house from guests – a sentiment reflected in their Airbnb reviews.

“People love the house. They love the character of the house and the one thing a lot of people say about my house is it has a really inviting feel and a very calming feel,” she said.

However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the couple have had to close down their bed and breakfast. And even though the province has started to reopen, they said physical-distancing measures would have disrupted the social atmosphere they like to foster between guests.

“We’d have to keep our guests separated, where we used to encourage them to socialize,” she said. “It would be running it in different way than we would normally run it and we didn’t feel comfortable with that.”

And with no immediate end in sight for the pandemic to restart the bed and breakfast, the couple said it’s time for them to move on and let others experience all that the house has to offer.

“We have two children, so it’s almost like when your children are growing up and you get to the point where you’ve done everything you can for them and it’s time for them to have other experiences,” Ms. Hulaj said. “And in this case, it’s time for someone else to experience this beautiful house.”

Some of agent Nancie McLeod’s colleagues warned her that the turnout for this rowhouse might be low due to the pandemic, but of those that did show up, there would be a higher ratio of serious buyers. In fact, she was flooded by dozens of requests for in-person showings during the week leading up to the offer date.

This 10-year-old semi-detached house has been on the market for over a year, listed with several agents. To offset its location next to commercial businesses and high inventory levels in the neighbourhood, agent Kelsey Jones gave the house a stylish makeover and priced it under $500,000.

Complicating matters, COVID-19 kept buyers away, despite the sellers moving out and strict showing protocols.

“We came to market on March 10, the same week the Alberta government started to impose restrictions and just days before the City of Calgary declared its state of local emergency,” Ms. Jones said.

Story continues below advertisement

“The sense of fear in the marketplace had already begun, so we knew we had to really get competitive on pricing if we hoped to have a chance of selling at all. We did end up implementing one price reduction to $489,800 to keep some action on the property and encourage showings.”

What they got

Open this photo in gallery There is a new gas fireplace in the living and dining area. CIR Realty

The 1,625-square-foot house has three-bedrooms and an additional 775 square feet of living space in the finished basement. There’s also a double garage on the 25-foot-by-125-foot lot.

Interior finishes have been upgraded, with granite kitchen counters, new hardwood flooring and a gas fireplace in the living and dining area.

There’s an office, four bathrooms and a laundry room upstairs.

The agent’s take

“How buyers viewed spaces during this time quickly changed,” Ms. Jones said.

“All of the sudden you needed a property where you had space for an office, a place to roll out a yoga mat or complete an at-home workout with gyms and yoga studios shut, and of course a yard so that you could step out and get some fresh air and maybe grow a few vegetables with a lot of the parks being shut down. This home offered the space to do it all.”

This stylish bachelor suite at the Atlantis building was only visited by a few parties over two months, which coincided with mandated lockdowns at the height of the pandemic this spring. To drum up more interest, its $475,000 list price was slashed in May.

“When we dropped it by $10,000 to about $465,000, that, along with the timing of things opening up and people starting to relax a bit, was a magical combination,” agent Amit Dhawan said.

“The crazy thing is there were larger bachelors available in this Fort York complex asking a much lower price. Yet we got an amazing price for our bachelor, which may have something to do with its view and exposure. It’s a northeast facing condo with Fort York directly in front of you, so nothing can be built there.”

The back story

Open this photo in gallery There is a massive stone fireplace into the main living space. Denis St. Jean/Denis St. Jean

The street address for Bryan Osborn’s Lac Tremblant home is misleading: It says the house is on Chemain Desmarais, but in fact it’s about 600 metres further down a private road marked as Impasse des Cascades on the map. There are only five or six other homes on this lane.

“There’s a long meandering drive through the forest following a cascading creek,” said Mr. Osborn. “You go over a post-and-beam bridge and come to our entrance Down the driveway and past the tennis court is the house, perched on the lakefront next to a private bay. The family calls the land Deer Point.

“When we built here, a couple guys who were happy to have the work told me, ‘This is our favourite place to hunt deer,’ Back then, you could hunt around the lake. But you can’t anymore.” The was once bare land, part of a larger lot belonging to the family of a friend from his youth. “When we had our first place on the lake, many years later, we rekindled our old relationship. I told him, if ever you want to chop off some of your property ... Many years later, he called me. ‘We’ve decided to sell the point... we know you we’d like to have you as the neighbour,’” Mr. Osborn said. The result was a 4.2 acre lot, much of it flat, with 750 feet of lake frontage.

Mr. Osborn knew what he wanted on the land: a post and beam home done to his specifications. He worked with a crew who had trained in British Columbia, making use of the massive fir forests for materials, before returning home to Quebec to set up a construction business. “Originally, we built it as a country home,” he said. “The kids spent summers and weekends here.” About 20 years ago, he sold his industrial packaging business and made Deer Point his home base, but he has kept busy with his passion for post and beam homes.

Among his post-retirement projects was a run as a custom-home developer. On nearby Lac Ouimet, he acquired land and worked out an arts-and-craft style template that allowed for some customization, building three homes to demonstrate his approach. Eventually he built and sold 22 homes at the Belvedere Estates, the last one in 2008, leaning heavily on locally-sourced artisans just as he had with Deer Point.

“Anybody that has the means wants to be on Lac Tremblant,” says Steven Lafave, listing agent and managing director of the Engel & Völkers Tremblant business (who also lives on an island in the 14 km long lake). “Lac Tremblant owners are full-timers or every weekenders; we’ve got a mix of sports figures and celebrities ... the usual suspects, some of the most affluent families from eastern Canada. Other families have owned properties for a long time. There’s the odd one, the über top of the food chain families like the Stroll family flying in on helicopters.” (Lawrence Stroll, Quebec billionaire investor (an early backer in Michael Kors) owns the Circuit Mont-Tremblant raceway and the F1 team Racing Point (to be renamed Aston Martin in 2021) which also employs his son Lance Stroll as a driver.

Some of the newer homes on the lake are palaces, 15,000- to 25,000- square feet, which is a little more than Mr. Osborn’s 6,500 square foot, four-bed and five-bath house. “We’ve had people come and want to buy the house and say it’s “big ‚and small,” he said. “‘If it only had five bedrooms instead of four.’” He’s in no rush to sell though (the house has been on the market since 2018). He said he’s looking for the discerning buyer.

The house today

Open this photo in gallery There are four bedrooms. Denis St. Jean/Denis St. Jean

The house is laid out on a centre-hall plan, with A-shaped frame that’s as big and open as a barn with wings on both sides. The front door sits at the middle of that central hall, a generous foyer looks into that hall, through the massive stone fireplace into the main living space. Just through the foyer is a landing that runs between the wings. On the right are the stairs to the basement, and a wing that contains two bedrooms. On the left is the wing that leads to the main bedroom and attached living quarters.

Step around the fireplace, down into a great room with a vaulting 20 foot-high ceiling. If it wasn’t already clear from the outside, this house is all about wood and the openness and light that is achieved by post and beam construction.

“We researched the wood, it came from Maine ... we wanted a particular white pine and we needed specific trees to make 12 by 12 square beams that were 40 feet long,” said Mr. Osborn. “We didn’t waste any other materials that were cut [some ended up in flooring or other trim finishings].”

Open this photo in gallery Showings typically involve a boat ride. Denis St. Jean/Denis St. Jean

Everywhere is pine, which has mellowed to a deep golden, it frames doors and windows, some walls and ceilings are panelled in it, everywhere the beams can be exposed they are. The craftsmanship is exceptional.

“And all of the interior finishings were made in various woodworking shops in the Laurentians. All our cabinetry, designed by a designer but fabricated in these artisan wood shops,” said Mr. Osborn. “Case in point, the doors are all two inches thick. You can’t put spindly little doors in a house with structural beams. The floors are made with same white pine, wide-plank, also two inches thick.”

Everything radiates out from central great room, the lake-side wall is practically all glass with three sets of glass double doors and with four massive triangular window panes above them that accentuate the A-shaped framing. The dining space sits just next to those windows, a sitting area sits between that the fireplace. A breakfast bar on the left runs along the raised counter that separates the room from the kitchen.

“We sit on our dock and watch the sunrise, most people on our side of the lake have to wait until 10 or 11 because the mountain is behind us and the sun comes up over the mountain,” said Mr. Osborn. But because the point extends into the small bay you can have unobstructed views of that morning light.

That’s part of the reason Mr. Lafave’s showings typically involve a boat ride, often picking the interested party up at the lakeside Hotel Quintessence. “If we don’t bring them in by boat we’ll end up on boat. It’s part of the process,” Mr. Lafave said, in part to show them how Deer Point’s land and location compares to the other lots on the lake. “We’ve got examples of people paying $4-million for a much lesser lot, going to build 15-20,000 square foot homes without flat land or bay or private road. In year’s past there were a few homes that were still available [to buy and tear down] now they are gone ... on that side of the lake with a road there are two options left; and they are both $10-million.”

After the pandemic struck in March, a few residents of the Norris Crescent Co-op lost their jobs and found themselves facing a world of financial uncertainty.

The co-op board snapped into action, offering up No Frills gift cards, a payment plan for missed rent cheques, and, perhaps most importantly, reassurance.

“We said no one would get evicted,” says board president Sharon Power, who has lived on Norris Crescent, in south Etobicoke, for about 15 years.

Sitting on a lawn chair outside her apartment, she watches cyclists ride by and casts an indulgent eye over the little community – 56 apartments ranging in size from one bedroom to four bedrooms, arrayed across ten two-storey post-war dwellings on a Mimico cul-de-sac abutting a lakefront park. There are about 200 residents, some of them very long-term, with a mix of incomes and ethnicities. In exchange for amazingly affordable rents ($1,600 is the highest), all are expected to participate somehow, from volunteering on the board to picking up stray mail.

Co-op living “is not without its challenges, I’m going to be honest,” Ms. Power says with a smile, allowing that everyone knows everyone else’s business. But, she adds, “[it] can be very rich. You have to have the intentionality of being an engaged member.”

In the past few years, engagement has also meant confronting the declining state of the buildings, which need new roofs, foundation repairs and building envelope upgrades. The co-op board, however, is also looking at redeveloping part of its landholdings – in effect replacing two of the houses closest to Lakeshore Road with a six-to-eight storey accessible mid-rise, with 35 to 50 units.

The board has hired a planning consultant to guide the members through the maze of zoning approvals and potential funding sources. Ms. Power points out that the plan also means that rents will have to rise by about 5 per cent to make the math work.

It’s a slow process, with plenty of risk for the co-op. As she says, “There’s got to be an easier way to assist co-ops with working through development plans.”

In spite of the speed bumps, Norris’ story offers a glimpse at what seems to be a bit of a renaissance in co-op housing development in Canada, especially in British Columbia and Quebec (see sidebar), where creative land and financing deals are bringing new projects online.

Tim Ross, executive director of the Co-op Housing Federation of Canada, says about 250,000 Canadians now live in affordable co-ops ranging in size from single apartment buildings to collections of low-rise dwellings. He knows from his members that demand, especially for family-suitable units, far exceeds supply.

The bulk of Canada’s co-ops date to the 1970s and 1980s, when the federal government pumped rent supplements and mortgage subsidies into these projects as an alternative to both private multi-unit residential slab towers and social housing complexes. At the time, they were seen as a progressive form of mixed-income urban housing.

Yet, with the subsequent surge of condo development, plus government decisions from the mid-1990s onward to phase out co-op subsidies, there’s been scant co-op development in the past 20 years. Mr. Ross says some co-op boards want to expand their portfolios or intensify, as in the case of Norris, but are held back by soaring real estate prices and forbidding development costs.

In B.C., however, affordable housing grants from the provincial NDP government and the City of Vancouver’s 2012 decision to transfer real estate at effectively no cost to community land trusts has meant that about 2,000 new affordable units will be built by 2023, about 70 per cent of them co-ops.

The first 350 are under construction, with one co-op in Vancouver’s River District set to open in August, according to Thom Armstrong, CEO of the Co-op Housing Federation of B.C. (CHFBC). Key to the plan has been low-cost loans from CMHC and a $2-million investment by VanCity, the credit union, to establish a properly capitalized development group to acquire assets and manage the process.

Open this photo in gallery Providence Ridge, a non-profit housing development in Kelowna, B.C., 54 townhomes acquired by the CLT in 2001. Co-operative Housing Federation of B.C.

Mr. Armstrong adds that CHFBC has been able to snap up derelict and virtually insolvent co-ops in places such as Port Moody and Port Coquitlam, invest in significant upgrades, and then transfer the ownership to a community land trust that is a subsidiary of the federation.

The last step means the property is not only removed from the private market in perpetuity, but becomes an asset that can be leveraged to acquire other parcels. (The Cooperative Housing Federation of Toronto also controls five land trusts that provide housing for 10,000 people living in 32 co-ops across the city.)

Decades of municipal land-banking can provide a steady source of real estate that co-ops can develop, Mr. Armstrong says. “There’s an enormous opportunity going forward.”

It appears that similar opportunities are cropping up in Toronto, as well.

Earlier this month, Toronto city council approved a deal with Streetcar Developments to upgrade an old house at 685 Queen St. E., near Broadview Avenue, which belongs to the Riverdale Co-op and has nine apartments. Located next to a Toyota dealership slated for redevelopment by Streetcar, the building will be expanded to 26 units, including complete upgrades of the original nine apartments.

Riverdale’s manager Adene Kuchera says the co-op owns 28 properties in the east end, with 124 units – mostly duplexes, triples and walk-ups. It was founded in 1974 and expanded until the 1980s, but the board hasn’t acquired new units since then. About half of its properties are mortgage free, Ms. Kuchera says.

While earlier proposals envisioned up to 80 units and 12 storeys, the scale was unrealistic. The project will be constructed by Streetcar, which is contributing $5.2-million in Section 37 grants, with another $11.2-million coming from waivers on city fees and taxes. Construction is expected to begin next year.

The number of proposed units was reduced shortly before the project landed at council so Streetcar wouldn’t risk neighbourhood objections or re-zoning appeals – a decision that brought criticism from some affordable housing watchers. But Councillor Paula Fletcher defended the compromise, saying it provides Riverdale’s board with financial certainty. “This has not been the easiest application.”

She points out that new-build co-ops are also envisioned for other development sites in the area, including a large mixed-income Toronto Community Housing complex being intensified by RioCan.

With evidence of deal flow in Canada’s two most expensive cities, co-op advocates are hoping that some of funding pledged under the Liberal government’s much touted National Housing Strategy will stoke the development of more co-op projects. But Tim Ross says the program remains “difficult to access.”

Adds Jon Harstone, a veteran affordable housing consultant who has managed the development or expansion several Toronto co-op projects, “Unless the feds put money into non-profits, this will all be one-offs.”

Montreal’s Student Co-op Housing Renaissance

Open this photo in gallery Rendering of Utile Papineau. Rayside Labossière

Laurent Levesque founded Utile, a student housing co-op development non-profit, in 2012 when he was still a planning undergrad at the Université du Quèbec à Montreal (UQAM), largely out of a desire to put his learning to good use.

Seven years later, the group’s first co-op venture, The Woodnote, at Concordia University, is set to open in September. The $18-million, 90-unit project, designed by Rayside Labossière, is backed by the Concordia student union and a pair of provincial student organizations, among other investors.

The units range in size from studios to four-bedroom suites, all fully fitted out with modern amenities instead of the dorm-style housing that’s far more common on and around Canadian campuses. Woodnote will accommodate up to 140 students. A second and larger Montreal project from Utile will open in 2022.

Unusually for co-ops, Utile’s ventures involve no provincial funding. What Utile has done is forge financial partnerships involving several credit unions, which tend to have social responsibility investment mandates, and student organizations that can provide a steady stream of revenues through a dedicated levy.

The City of Montreal offered a $1.6-million grant, and Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. supplied a $3-million loan. The financing allowed Utile to buy land for both projects. Woodnote, in fact, is located in Montreal’s desirable Plateau area.

The organization operates as the developer, providing the expertise that has been lacking in the student co-op housing world for years, says Mr. Levesque. “You need a development organization to make projects like these work.”

Open this photo in gallery Rendering of Note des bois interior. Rayside Labossière

He sees both projects as “proof of concept” developments that offer an alternative vehicle for delivering higher-density student housing complexes, which are typically contracted out to private developers by university administrators.

Mr. Levesque points out that Utile is working on several student housing co-op projects outside Quebec, all of which are still in the early stages. “There’s no secret recipe. Our model is completely scalable and replicable across the country.”

The sale of this semi-detached house could not be postponed by the sellers, so their agents moved forward with their marketing plans in late May, staging the space themselves and providing video and 3-D tours. More staff were brought on to facilitate more than 60 in-person visits, with increased cleaning measures, and to oversee a bidding war on the presentation date in early June.

“The market had started to pick up – we were seeing offer dates and houses selling within a week – so we felt confident this was going to sell, but we were not expecting 15 offers,” agent Lisa-Marie Doorey said.

“And it sold for a record price much higher than pre-COVID-19 prices for the neighbourhood.”

This three-bedroom house was built more than 100 years ago across from East Lynn Park, but has been extensively improved in recent years, complete with an updated bachelor suite in the basement.

The living and dining rooms are completely open to each other, and the rear kitchen was extended and refashioned with a pantry, long quartz counters, glass tile back plashes and double glass doors to the terrace.

A fenced backyard and parking on a mutual driveway round out the 19-foot-by-121-foot lot.

The agent’s take

“What this house has – that a lot don’t have – is a finished basement that could be great for teenagers or in-laws with a separate entrance and kitchenette,” Ms. Doorey said.

“[Plus, the sellers] really worked on the curb appeal of the house, adding a new front porch … and they opened up the back of the house, so you got the ‘wow’ factor when you walked in because you could see the garden.”

The owners of this detached house could not avoid listing it in late March, so their agent devised strict viewing protocols, increased cleanings between visitors and provided sanitation stations. After a couple of weeks of sluggish buyer turnout, the price was dropped by $127,000 in April.

“The [market] conditions weren’t the same it was the month previous, so we priced it to sell and we had five offers in two days,” agent Belinda Lelli said.

This 2,128-square-foot house was built on a 30-foot-by-110-foot lot about 30 years ago, with formal living and dining rooms. It also as a family room with a gas fireplace above the double garage.

Casual lounging can also be done in the rear sunroom, which exits to a south-facing backyard, or the basement, which features open entertaining area and a second kitchen.

Upstairs, the largest of three bedrooms contains a walk-in closet and fourth bathroom.

The agent’s take

“An above average home inspection and a separate entrance to a fully finished basement helped to draw great interest, as the potential for rental income was attractive to the majority of buyers,” Ms. Lelli said.

“This home, situated on a quiet cul-de-sac, is ideal for young families. Schools, parks and shopping are also within walking distance, as is the local community/recreation centre.”

Buyers interested in this modern townhouse could check out a 48-page brochure and a time-lapse construction video before deciding whether they wanted an in-person tour in late April.

“Might we have had 30 plus showings in a typical market?” agent Paul Johnston asked. “I think so. But the 14 we did have didn’t disappoint us, because the people making the effort to see this home had genuine and thorough interest in it.”

“As this was a brand-new house, we sell those pretty much for the asking price. So the upside is you’re not going to pay more. But the downsize is, you’re not going to get a deal.”

“The two things that make it different is it’s a very small condominium with two homes, and it’s a modern semi,” Mr. Johnston said.

“Instead of being divided along the length of the lot, they’re more or less divided by the width of the lot, so … it’s a clever way of building because you get the benefit of a wide home with lots of windows and nice room sizes.”

“All the framing was done in a factory, so all the walls fit perfectly, arrived preinsulated and presheathed, and over the course of five days it was put up, so the benefit was the speed of construction, accuracy and nothing gets exposed to the elements,” Mr. Johnston said.

“These are really well designed, but they’re also environmentally sensitive homes.”

The listing agents had prepared a walkthrough video and 3-D dollhouse tour for this four-bedroom house less than 500 metres from Runnymede subway station and High Park. But in early June, upward of 70 potential buyers wanted a closer look, even if it meant travel and health disclosures, viewing restrictions and long wait times.

“There were times I couldn’t show my own listing,” agent Mark Oulahen said. “There were no overlapping appointments and 30-minute appointments max, so they just filled in.” In the end, he received 16 offers.

The recent designer-lead makeover further elevated the property’s value. “They have a well constructed design and finish, and they spent some money on landscaping, which ties everything together,” Mr. Oulahen said.

Out of country buyers sought an older, but renovated home with a two-car garage and an address near family and friends residing in Riverdale. Although they largely considered detached homes, their virtual visit of this semi-detached candidate near Withrow Park pushed them to outbid another interested party in mid-May.

Josie Kao/The Globe and Mail

A new five-storey laneway apartment building in Vancouver’s Commercial Drive neighbourhood offers a glimpse into the future of density in the city, while also raising questions about who exactly density is for in Vancouver.

The development, designed by Cornerstone Architecture, is around a month from completion and soon to go on the rental market. Its uniqueness lies in its height and location at the backend of a larger property, much like a laneway house, which architect Scott Kennedy quipped about on Twitter.

This is our 5 storey version of a laneway house on a 33’ corner lot. 8 suites. Heritage building in front preserved. Unfortunately not a passive house pic.twitter.com/Ycxb3mtVad — Scott Kennedy (@ScottMKennedy) May 12, 2020





Story continues below advertisement

The infill development has four one-bedroom units and four two-bedroom units spread over four floors, in addition to a ground floor serving as a lobby area. The building was also developed under heritage requirements, which necessitated preserving the heritage building at the front end of the property. Cornerstone architect Luke Han, who worked closely on the project, says he had to get creative with the tight property lines in order to fit all eight units on the 9,560-square-foot site, although they were able to receive a slight exemption to the height limit.

From the city’s perspective, the compromises were worth it because of the large incentive to secure market rentals along Commercial Drive, a highly sought-after neighbourhood in Vancouver. City of Vancouver director of development services Andrea Law believes this type of development is indicative of the direction that the city hopes to pursue.

However, while the building, which is located at 1102 Commercial Drive, does increase the number of rental units available in a competitive part of the city, there are concerns as to who the target renter is.

“It’s unclear to me who the units are for,” says Lisa Moffatt, an urban planner and owner of the consulting firm Resilience Planning who lives in the neighbourhood. While she appreciates that the development activates an underutilized laneway, she points out that the units are market rentals, meaning that a large segment of Vancouver will be unable to afford them, an exclusion that particularly affects marginalized groups.

While the units are not available yet, Mr. Kennedy estimates that the one-bedroom units should go anywhere from $1,700-$1,800 a month, while the two-bedroom units would cost between $2,200-$2,500 a month.

Vancouver’s 10-year housing plan, approved in 2017, set out a goal of having 50 per cent of new homes being affordable for family households earning under $80,000. Affordability in Vancouver is defined as spending less than 30 per cent of one’s income before taxes on rent, meaning that a household earning $80,000 a year would pay at most $2,000 a month.

However, Vancouver’s 2020 progress report on its housing plan shows that the city is far behind its affordability goals. In 2019, Vancouver built just 61 below-market rental units, short of its goal of 400. In the three years since the plan was approved, only 34 per cent of approved homes have been affordable to incomes below $80,000.

Story continues below advertisement

The units being sold at market price is one reason Ms. Moffatt is critical of the development, but she believes the conversation should be more focused around challenging what planners mean when they talk about density.

“I think we keep asking the wrong question in the density-slash-affordability conversations,” she says. “What is the problem we’re trying to address with density? It’s unclear. Is it to provide more housing or affordable housing? Providing more density is like a Band Aid; it doesn’t get to the root causes of what made housing unaffordable.”

She says that rather than just saturating the market to address affordability, it would be more effective to take an intersectional approach to planning. Current mainstream discussions around density ignore social determinants of health, income, race and disability, which effectively exclude large segments of Vancouver’s population and heighten the housing crisis, Ms. Moffatt says.

For instance, Vancouver’s housing report recognizes that Indigenous peoples in the city are disproportionately affected by the housing crisis and includes pledges to rectify the issue. However, Ms. Moffatt says she has yet to see any tangible progress.

“Vancouver made a commitment to reconciliation several years ago,” she says. “That needs to be taken into consideration where housing is concerned and recognizing that we are all operating on stolen land.”

Vancouver’s 2019 housing report also found that the number of unsheltered homeless people in the city increased in the year prior by 122 people, with 40 per cent of the population identifying as Indigenous. Indigenous peoples only account for 2.2 per cent of Vancouver’s wider population.

“When we talk about density, what I wonder is, what does a decolonial approach to density look like, and why are we not asking that question?” Ms. Moffatt says.

Like Ms. Moffatt, Mr. Kennedy also has concerns around discussions of density, as he cautions against approaching it as the solution to rising house prices.

“Is more density going to make it more affordable? Not necessarily, because the price of land goes up when the density goes up. So you have to somehow control the price of land as you get density.”

He is particularly concerned about densification’s effects on Vancouver’s more unique neighbourhoods. It isn’t only that small businesses tend to get pushed out when commercials streets are targeted for densification, he says, but that commercials streets are more likely to be targeted in the first place.

A better future for density could look like gentler developments or densifications in the lanes behind commercials streets, Mr. Kennedy says. In either case, his firm’s new development could act as a model for future developments.

These pressures around densification are not lost on the city, Ms. Law says, and discussions around it are always evolving at the municipal level around how to better support communities and neighbourhoods experiencing change.

Story continues below advertisement

At the end of it all, any conversation around housing in Vancouver must be about listening to the needs of the community and looking at how those needs can best be met.

“It’s really about balancing the tradeoffs,” she says.

While this new development is a fairly simple project and in fact is under the maximum allowable density, it is notable because of the role it plays in Vancouver’s larger plans for increasing density.

As Vancouver moves forward with its plan to dramatically increase the number of units available to residents of all incomes, its laneways may soon be seeing more of these types of developments accompanied by more questions around what density means.

The elderly seller had moved out of the house and downsized. Her parents had bought the house in the 1950s, so it was a major decision to sell, listing agent Scott Thompson says. The property sold at the end of April, after two weeks on the market.

“There were a number of interested parties, but only one group came to the table and made an offer,” Mr. Thompson says.

The buyers are a family looking at renovating or building new and then living in the house. The sale completed on July 30.

The agent’s take

“Right now the market appears to be very strong. There are more buyers and more sellers right now than there were in the spring when COVID-19 was intensifying. July will have more sales than any other month so far this year in Greater Vancouver.”

For the first week of exposure in April, this two-storey house was completely vacant, but not a single buyer requested to step inside. An online virtual tour with computer-generated staging was posted and some bargain hunters made low-ball verbal offers, which were rejected. More serious shoppers trickled through the house in person in the first half of May.

“The fear was so high, but then it picked up like crazy because people realized new listings are not coming out every week right now, and for how long?” agent Robert Nelson said.

“In that area, we happened to be only one of four properties and we happened to be the lowest priced property, so all those things came together for us.”

Agent Nutan Brown’s clients were on the hunt for a turnkey bungalow and spotted a “Coming Soon” sign outside this updated, three-bedroom bungalow in May. It was being staged, but they were granted a tour, and decided to lodge their bid before others could see it.

“We were able to arrange a visit and viewing,” Ms. Brown said. But she said the sign had also grabbed the attention of another potential buyer. “Another agent also called, so it wasn’t a slam dunk. We ended up competing - before it’d gone to market,” Ms. Brown said.

“We had been looking for two years,” Ms. Brown said. “This home checked all the boxes, and sometimes when you let that slip, it can take another two years to come along. So they really wanted this home badly.”

Over the past 15 years, this 1960s home with an attached garage was extensively renovated with new roofing, windows and operating systems, as well as a remodelled kitchen with a granite-topped island and heated floors.

The flooring is also heated in the basement suite, where there is a galley kitchen, bathroom and separate entry.

Wood burning and gas fireplaces are featured in entertaining areas on the main and lower levels.

“It feels like it has been loved and beautifully maintained. There’s pride of ownership throughout, there was nothing of concern, so we didn’t even do a home inspection,” Ms. Brown said.

“[The sellers] had done professional landscaping and maintained it beautifully, and landscaping is expensive, so it’s like a $50,000 to $75,000 bonus.”

This two-storey suite at the Skylofts II building was held off the market until pandemic restrictions were eased in late May. Thereafter, visitors following safety protocols could view a 3-D online tour or make in-person visits to the freshly painted and staged space.

“At the end of March and the beginning of April, we didn’t know what was going to happen, but we saw things were still moving along, so we decided to go for it,” agent Jenelle Cameron said.

“It was only on the market for two days when we got two offers. In the first few days, we had four or five showings, but even after it sold conditionally, we had another ten showings, so it was busy.” It took some days for the conditions on the offer to be satisfied and the deal was done.

In late May, agent Linda Ing-Gilbert hosted her first virtual open house for this two-bedroom residence and gathered more than 150 viewers, despite technical glitches locking out about a dozen others. The second run brought even more participants, yet 80 potential buyers still requested on-site showings as Ontario entered Stage 1 of its reopening.

“The resale market – especially for starter houses – is in high demand with little supply,” Ms. Ing-Gilbert said.

“When this house came out, there were three other houses in the same price point, but they were on main streets and this one’s on a quiet side street.”

Neighbours even complained of the uptick in traffic despite the hassle of COVID-related waivers and safety gear to enter. “There were no double appointments – they were half hour time slots only – so if there was any overlap, people had to stand outside and wait,” Ms. Ing-Gilbert said.

“We had six offers and we would’ve had more, but everybody was afraid of competing.”

The action

This side-split residence was originally priced at $615,000 to reflect recent improvements done throughout. But it had a small, two-piece, master ensuite. That, added to stiff competition from three other homes for sale nearby, meant it managed only six home tours between late February and mid March.

The price was dropped to $588,000 and a bid followed in late April.

“Because this is an older, established neighbourhood, there’s generally never too many listings on at the same time, especially renovated homes,” said agent Robert Vanovermeire.

“It’s possible if COVID-19 hadn’t hit, they might have gotten a little more money. So the timing was crazy, but … it goes to show that in any market condition, there are still people buying houses.”

What they got

This four-level structure was built in 1961 on a 50-foot-by-100-foot lot. It has been updated numerous times and has a new roof and furnace and three renovated bathrooms with heated floors and porcelain finishes.

The main floor was remodelled to create open living and dining areas with exposed mahogany beams in the vaulted ceilings. The kitchen has Brazilian granite counters and upscale, stainless steel appliances.

The main staircase leads up to three bedrooms and down to family, guest and laundry rooms.

Extra space is provided in the finished basement and detached, double garage.

“Very few have the four-level split floorplan … most in that area are bungalows,” Mr. Vanovermeire said.

“The finishings in this four-level split home are spectacular. Keeping within the mid-century modern theme, they were able to open up the space of the main living room and keep the natural beams above.”

Jason Bykewich/Jason Bykewich

In the dining room of Jason Bykewich’s childhood home, his parents had a black-and-red candelabra with a fiddlehead shape. As a baby, he was drawn to this fixture. When his father carried him past it, he’d grasp at it. “I wanted to touch it and see it up close,” he says. He was similarly transfixed by the ornate balusters beneath the armrests of the living-room couch. He’s disinclined to read too much into these childhood fascinations. Clearly, even then, he liked irregular shapes. Perhaps it was their distinctiveness that appealed to him. Or their resemblances to natural forms – snail shells, tendrils, Aloe plants.

As an adult, Mr. Bykewich developed an interest in Art Nouveau – the decorative-arts craze that flourished in Europe and the British Isles from 1890 to 1910. The Nouveau movement – with its sinuous, elongated and asymmetrical forms – took inspiration from wild nature. It was a folksy alternative to the neoclassical style, which was all about symmetry and grandeur and had dominated for much of the previous two centuries.

When Mr. Bykewich and his wife, Geneviève, a journalist, acquired a $405,000 property in Edmonton’s Old Strathcona neighbourhood, he saw a chance not only to build a forever home for his family (the couple has two young boys) but also to experiment with curvilinear shapes, the kind you don’t often see on the Prairies. As the principal of Ethos Engineering, a local consulting firm, Mr. Bykewich possessed the expertise necessary to pull such a project off. And while the house is by no means an exemplar of Art Nouveau design – it feels, with its heavy timber, rough finishes and rugged masonry, very much like a Prairie home – it nevertheless draws loosely on Nouveau principles. It is an assemblage of irregular, curvy forms in a city where such things are rare.

If, in Edmonton and elsewhere, homebuilders tend to prefer angular over curved structures, it’s partly because these are the easiest forms to create. Lumber comes in planks. Bricks and cinderblocks are rectangular. To arrange or stack these materials in the most sensible way is to build a house that looks, well, like a house – a boxy structure, perhaps with a gabled or hipped roof. Sure, you’re free to bend the walls or sculpt the rooms if you want to, but this takes effort, time and engineering savvy.

On the other hand, when else was Mr. Bykewich going to get such a chance? “This was the first project in my career where I had a blank page,” he says. “I thought, ‘If I want to realize some of the crazy ideas that have been floating around in my head, what would that look like?’ It’s not very often that you get an opportunity to build something from scratch.”

Using Autodesk Revit, a 3-D-modelling application, he designed a two-storey, 1,950-square-foot home with a rounded front façade, a terraced second-floor balcony, and two main spaces – a kitchen-dining area with concrete floors on the ground level and a living room with maple floors above – both with irregular shapes. (The more conventionally shaped master bedroom is tucked behind the upstairs living room, and the children’s bedrooms are in the basement, overlooking a lightwell.)

To produce curved walls, a builder must find ways to make rounded forms out of rectangular materials. Using a jigsaw, Mr. Bykewich cut sinuous, parabolic strips of plywood. These pieces served as the bottom plates for the walls. He mounted vertical studs on top of them and then wrapped the drywall, which had been watered down to increase malleability, around the studs so that it mimicked the curvilinear shapes of the underlying plates.

The walls aren’t the only distinctive feature in the home. Mr. Bykewich had all of the front-facing windows custom fabricated; like the rooms, they are more pond-shaped than circular. The exposed beams on the ground floor are arranged in a tree-like pattern. Thick spans of Douglas-fir glulam, an engineered wood product, extrude diagonally from a central concrete column. These pieces then bifurcate and give way to lighter beams, just as a bough gives way to branches and twigs.

The best element in the house is the first one you see. In the foyer, a few feet past the entrance, Mr. Bykewich set a five-foot-high trombe wall – a masonry structure that absorbs solar energy streaming in through the windows, thereby cooling the interiors by day. It is clad in a mixture of found stones and salvaged bricks, all set in a “free lay” pattern: the rows bend and turn randomly, as if drawn by hand. “The wall looks geological,” Mr. Bykewich says, “like a natural deposition.”

These unique flourishes belie the technical sophistication of the home, which is outfitted with thick exterior walls, an energy-recovery ventilator and a hydronic heating system, whereby water is pumped though a network of tubes beneath the floors. Unlike a conventional radiator, which blasts heat from a fixed point, this system runs everywhere and therefore heats the home with minimal energy inputs. To get a room up to a comfortable 20 C, you must heat the water to a mere 22 C. Because he put in much of his own labour, Mr. Bykewich kept construction-and-material costs down to $475,000, and he expects to save on energy expenditures as the years go by.

For such an experimental project, there’s a strong element of Prairie pragmatism at play. The house has little of the delicacy one associates with Art Nouveau. But that’s not the point. Imagine an alternative universe in which elements of Nouveau had somehow migrated to the Prairies and become enmeshed, however vaguely, in the local building vernacular. Mr. Bykewich’s house exists in such a world. When discussing his stylistic choices, he speaks not in the manner of an effete craftsman but rather like a pioneer homesteader. “This is our piece of land,” he says. “We can do whatever we want with it.”

The backstory

Open this photo in gallery The side of the living room that creates a passage to the back patio has the original brick and beam. Andrea Simone/Andrea Simone

In 1999, Merike Bauer’s parents, Ants and Laurel Reigo, searched for a building that had both a space to work and a place to call home. The couple were also looking for a large space, something they were already used to after living and working in a small converted warehouse at Lansdowne Avenue and Dupont Street that had an art studio, a residence and commercial space.

“It was like an early loft conversion from the 80s,” Ms. Bauer says.

Her parents found what they were looking for at 1205 Bathurst St. They bought the 8,730-square-foot property soon after seeing a “For Sale” sign outside the building. The couple knew immediately that it was a place where they could have the same sort of lifestyle as in their previous home, while still maintaining their business.

“They just drove by and saw it,” Ms. Bauer says. “We’ve always felt lucky to have found it when we did.”

Since then, the building has been shared among three generations of Ms. Bauer’s family. “It was myself, my parents and my grandmother who all lived in the building,” she says. The ground floor was originally occupied by Ms. Bauer’s parents’ working space, the Studio 8 Graphics Fine Art Printing Studio.

The home today

The former Studio 8 Graphics shop is now the offices of Ms. Bauer’s architecture firm, Reigo & Bauer, run by Meriko and Stephen Bauer. There are two more commercial rental units on the ground floor; one, with tall ceilings and glass block clerestory, is currently used by a Pilates studio. The other unit, located at the front of the building, is used as a private office. The ground floor also has a large undeveloped studio space where Mr. Reigo spends time painting.

“The ‘raw’ studio space is the part of the printing shop my dad retained and still had set up for printing and with his risers for printing,” Ms. Bauer says.

The second floor has two apartments; Meriko, her husband and their children, as well as Ms. Bauer’s parents, live on this floor. It also features a 2,000-square-foot rooftop garden that sits between the two apartments. Bauer’s apartment is located in front of the building, her parents at the back of the building.

Over the years, and especially since her parents retired from their printing business, Ms. Bauer and her husband have made changes to the building. “My husband and I started a design practice, so we converted some of the building over to a studio space for our business,” Ms. Bauer says.

Most of the units in the building have been rejuvenated and modernized, including some elements that date from the 1930s such as the gumwood doors with etched glass panels. The building now includes built-in cabinetry, a modern kitchen with marble counters and hardwood flooring throughout. A scissor lift was also installed to help bring large-scale plants to the rooftop garden and assist Ms. Bauer’s mother with mobility issues. The side of the living room that creates a passage to the back patio has the original brick and beam and all the windows have been replaced with high efficiency glazing that has a solar reflective element. Ms. Bauer says the redesign has been gradual as the building’s attributes have been slowly revealed. “Architectural qualities are seen and brought back to life. There’s different approaches that have been taken in different spaces,” Ms. Bauer says.

Ms. Bauer and her family love the flexibility a large and varied space has given them. “[It has] allowed us over the years to have a lot of different solutions to our living and working conditions,” she says.

Real estate agent Susan Delean says the building offers a timely live/work solution for a potential buyer. “We’re living in a time where you have to work from home. … It provides almost like a textbook COVID response … in terms of your living environment and your working environment, this property is like tailored made for that,” Ms. Delean says.

Ms. Bauer says living and working in the same space is also family friendly, making it easier to take care of the kids after school, or when they are sick at home. And raising their children in a multi-generational building has helped create a closer bond between them and their grandparents. “We’ve found [that] our kids are getting to grow up with a second set of parents… which has been a very lovely thing,” Ms. Bauer says.

She says the area blends the best parts of a residential neighbourhood and commercial life. “It’s a neighbourhood that is a very desirable place for families and businesses alike,” Ms. Bauer says.

Ms. Bauer says the rooftop garden is one of her favourite spaces, and one the family has spent more than two decades working on. Ms. Delean says the spot is breathtaking. “You cannot walk onto that rooftop and not have your jaw drop,” she says.

But Ms. Bauer, her greatest joy was to see the multiple generations of her family grow in the building over years and the memories created from the time she lived with here with her family while in university, to the time of renovations and the creating of different spaces. “The fact that we started here with my grandmother, my parents and me… we’ve been able to adapt the building to suit our needs.”

Last summer, agent Alex Moloney easily sold a two-bedroom-plus-den corner suite without parking for $1.62-million. But when this similar unit directly two floors above opened to the public mid-March, building management wanted to shut buyers out due to pandemic concerns. They eventually relented and a buyer was found.

“The unit was vacant, so it wasn’t like someone was living there, which would have been a different situation,” Mr. Moloney said. “So it was easy to show.”

“It wasn’t a panic sale. There was a lot of uncertainly at the time, but we sold it for a fair price because of the rarity of the plan and view.”

There are hardwood floors in the kitchen, den and bedrooms. The largest bedroom also has a walk-in closet and full bathroom with heated floors.

The unit comes with laundry facilities and a storage locker. Monthly fees are $781 and include the cost of water and heating, concierge, gym, pool and rooftop terrace.

“There are only five or six units with this plan at the southeast corner of the building, so it’s pretty rare,” Mr. Moloney said.

“The advantage of this building is its location in the heart of St. Lawrence Market, overlooking Berczy Park, and you’re close to Yonge Street to get onto the subway, the Financial District and Union Station.”

Like many realtors working Canada’s recreational markets, David Jurek says he’s seen properties move unusually quickly since the start of COVID-19.

The Re/Max real estate agent in 100 Mile House, B.C., recently listed a $140,000 home in an off-the-grid region where he’s had difficulty in the past: “The last and only sale that we had there took about three years to sell,” Mr. Jurek says. “I listed this property thinking, ‘Okay, well, this year maybe we’ll get more action.‘”

But shortly after listing, Mr. Jurek started receiving daily inquiries on the house. Before long, he had three offers on it.

“Some of the stuff that normally would sit, that wasn’t as choice of a property necessarily in the past is now selling very quickly,” Mr. Jurek says.

He attributes the quick heat-up in the B.C. recreational property market to COVID-19 lockdown orders, part of a growing trend in which Canadians are looking to vacation property in search of space, an alternative place from which to work remotely or a driveable vacation destination while travel is not an option.

“People who maybe weren’t in the second home and recreational market before are now saying, ‘Hey, we need to do that. If we can make it happen let’s make it happen,’” Mr. Jurek says.

He’s seen month-over-month sales increase by an estimated 30 per cent in his region since the start of the pandemic. And while demand has risen across the market, he says prices have yet to climb to match, so those looking to buy should explore their options quickly.

The same has occurred in the greater Vancouver region, home to the Sunshine Coast and Whistler, according to Colette Gerber, realtor at Sutton West Coast Realty and chair of the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver. “Last month we saw a 21-per-cent increase in sales,” Ms. Gerber says. “So, yes, it looks like vacation homes are now becoming a hot commodity.”

The Muskoka region and other parts of Ontario’s cottage country have seen similar upticks in demand, according to David Reid, sales representative at Enjoy Muskoka Realty in Gravenhurst, Ont., and former president of the Ontario Real Estate Association. “One of the big drivers really is high speed internet,” he says. “You’ve got such great quality internet now and the paradigms have changed.”

Not every cottage comes with strong cell or web service, of course, and for many this is a non-starter. Those unfamiliar with the area in which they’re shopping should look for a realtor who knows the region well, all three agents suggest.

While this rule typically goes without saying, it’s especially important when searching for lakefront, rural and two- or three-season properties, which come with their own quirks. In B.C., for example, it’s important to understand the underground system from which a property sources its water, Ms. Gerber says. “You need local knowledge to know what the ramifications are, how to deal with a well, how to deal with septic fields,” she says.

And in lake country, buyers should understand the permitting rules and nuances of the specific piece of water they’re looking at. A good realtor with hyperlocal knowledge can help with this.

“We do have a lot of waterfront, but it can be very different from one lake to the next,” Mr. Jurek says of 100 Mile House. “Are you wanting to buy that second property and be able to water ski or are you just wanting to be able to fish? What lake you back on to determines what you can expect that you can do there.”

Recreational properties also come with their own specific maintenance requirements. While year-round homes have owners’ constant attention, summer spots need an extra set of eyes (and hands, in the event of snowfall) during colder months.

Mr. Reid suggests finding a helpful neighbour or enlisting the services of a local road maintenance or cottage sitter program, such as Muskoka Cottage Sitters, which typically comes with fees of a few hundred dollars a month but offers owners peace of mind and protection from accidents.

In addition to maintenance fees, prospective buyers should budget for repairs and winter-proofing expenses – such as replacing windows, adding insulation and updating utilities – which can run in the thousands depending on what a home needs. Ensuring that a house is protected from winter weather will “keep insurance happy,” Mr. Jurek says. “If you don’t follow the proper procedures and you have a problem, you don’t want to be denied the claim.”

Story continues below advertisement

While the costs of owning vacation property go far beyond a home’s sale price, first-time buyers shouldn’t be intimidated. Go into the process with eyes wide open, do your research, spend a few days in the area and ask your realtor as many questions as possible. The more you know about a home, the better.

“The best way to find a vacation home is start driving,” Ms. Gerber says. “Go to these areas. Look around.”

Agent Elli Davis often stages her properties and hosts open houses and showings, but it was all done virtually for this three-storey house to continue with the owners’ original timeline to sell mid-April.

“Because the supply of homes was very low and the property was vacant, I recommended that it was okay to list it,” Ms. Davis said.

“We had two written offers quite quickly considering the circumstances.”

This 96-year-old house has a centre-hall design set sideways on the 40-foot-by-145-foot lot, so the main foyer is situated off the driveway and flanked by formal living and dining rooms.

The kitchen was updated with cork floors, pot lights and an island overlooking a rear family room with heated hardwood flooring and a bank of French doors to a south-facing deck and fenced backyard.

The upper floors house an office space and four bedrooms, including a master suite with a walk-in closet and one of three bathrooms. There’s an extra bedroom in the basement.

The agent’s take

“It was a lovely lot on a nice block just east of Mount Pleasant, and north of St. Clair in the heart of Moore Park,” Ms. Davis said.

“It was a side entrance, centre-hall home with a private drive and a detached, double garage, which is a great asset.”

Site C is supposed to deliver electricity that could power a half-million homes for many decades.
One could definitely say Ms. Clark and her BC Liberals were reckless when they approved Site C in 2014.","It was obvious from the start that the Site C hydroelectric dam under construction in northeastern British Columbia was in danger of turning into a financial quagmire.

BC Hydro had wanted to build Site C for decades. It had already built two big dams on the Peace River, completed in 1968 and 1980. BC Hydro’s DNA is dams, and it hadn’t built a new one since 1984. By 2010, the BC Liberal government of the day had become gung ho for Site C, the most expensive build in the province’s history.

The bill at the time was about $6-billion. Then it was $7.9-billion. By the time the Liberals approved it in late 2014, after they had exempted it from an independent review, the bill was $8.8-billion. Once construction got under way, then Liberal premier Christy Clark vowed, in her own words, to push the project to the point of no return.

Story continues below advertisement

The NDP had long opposed Site C and, when the party gained power in 2017, it ordered a review by the B.C. Utilities Commission – which is what should have been done years earlier. About $2-billion had been spent by then.

The review found that BC Hydro’s forecast of future demand was “excessively optimistic,” and said “increasingly viable alternative energy” such as wind and geothermal could provide similar benefits. But the commission did not issue a firm yes or no, although it noted that another $2-billion would have to be spent if the project was halted for good.

Former NDP premier Mike Harcourt at the time said Site C was a “clear, unmitigated disaster.” Still, at the end of 2017, NDP Premier John Horgan decided to go ahead – as the budget spiked to $10.7-billion – believing the project was too advanced to stop.

It was the classic sunk-cost fallacy, colloquially described as throwing good money after bad.

Cost pressures kept on bubbling, a constant upward push. The official news landed in late July: BC Hydro admitted it is in big trouble. The project is at risk, starting with the budget and schedule. There are significant issues with worker safety, the environment, litigation and relations with Indigenous people, who are opposed to the project. There are also daunting geotechnical problems, and the COVID-19 pandemic hasn’t helped, either.

With $5.1-billion spent as of the end of March, Site C was already $400-million over its 2017 budget. BC Hydro is working to “re-baseline” the numbers. An overhauled budget is expected later this fall. No prizes will be awarded for predicting several billion will be added to the tally.

This sort of saga is all too typical when it comes to large hydro projects. Newfoundland and Labrador’s Muskrat Falls is a nightmare that has brought the province to the financial brink. This will not be the case in B.C. – its fiscal position is arguably the strongest among all the provinces – but the exact same mistakes were made. Political leaders and a Crown corporation built on hydro dams wanted a glamorous new project. The promoters overstated the benefits. They underestimated the risks. They ignored the alternatives. And, worst, they skirted a real review.

This series of errors is standard around the world. Research from Oxford University, published nine months before Ms. Clark approved Site C in 2014, concluded “large dams in a vast majority of cases are not economically viable.”

At this point, what’s needed is a true accounting of what Site C will cost British Columbians. When the number lands this fall, the NDP government will have to reckon with the situation. Shutting the project down would be extreme – and extremely expensive. It is probably beyond the point of no return. That should, however, not be taken as a given. The sunk-cost fallacy still looms – throwing many more billions at what’s turning into a cash bonfire.

Site C is supposed to deliver electricity that could power a half-million homes for many decades. Dams have supplied years of low-cost energy to B.C. But they are an antiquated and destructive technology – Site C will flood 55 square kilometres of land – at a time when the cost of wind, solar and other renewable energy have plummeted.

One could argue that Mr. Horgan made the wrong call in 2017. One could definitely say Ms. Clark and her BC Liberals were reckless when they approved Site C in 2014. But those decisions are in the past. The only thing to do now is take a clear-eyed look at the present. Once a new, robust budget is in hand, all options must be on the table.

Do it, and you’re on the hook when the prime minister inevitably ignores your request that he ruin his political career “for the sake of the country.”

It looks weak when it fails, which is every time, and it can also look ill-judged. A measure as drastic as resignation should reflect the severity of the justification for calling for it. It can’t be trotted out every time a scandal breaks without becoming meaningless.

Story continues below advertisement

The truth is, if a prime minister actually committed a misdeed heinous enough to merit his or her resignation, no one on the opposition benches would need to demand that it happen. There would be enough torsion energy coming from the public, and from within the PM’s own party, to load and fire the catapult.

The resignation issue came up last week when Yves-François Blanchet, the leader of the Bloc Québécois, called for the heads of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, based on their poor (but not resignation-worthy, in our opinion) judgment in the WE Charity scandal. For good measure, he also demanded the resignation of Katie Telford, Mr. Trudeau’s chief of staff. (Mr. Morneau announced his resignation late Monday over an unrelated issue.)

Had Mr. Blanchet left it at that, no one would be talking about it this week. But he went a step further and vowed that he will attempt to trigger a general election this fall if his daring triple-resignation manoeuvre is rebuffed.

Given the historically low success rate of opposition leaders’ calls for resignations, Mr. Blanchet has now committed himself to tabling a no-confidence motion when the House resumes.

There’s no other way around it. The chances of Mr. Trudeau, his Finance Minister and his chief of staff resigning en masse over the WE Charity scandal were zero, and Mr. Blanchet knew it. If he wasn’t grandstanding, he should begin drafting his no-confidence motion immediately. Why procrastinate?

The reason Mr. Blanchet has decided to go this route isn’t exactly self-evident. For starters, it seems unlikely that another party would team up with the BQ this fall in order to give them the required votes to pass the motion.

The motion is a non-starter without the Conservatives, but the Official Opposition will still be breaking in a new party leader and probably won’t be eager to test the electoral waters so quickly. The NDP is low on funds and not in a solid position to campaign.

The most recent polling isn’t favourable, either. The Liberals are still leading all parties. If an election were called, Mr. Blanchet could see his attempt to dethrone the Prime Minister result in Mr. Trudeau winning a new mandate.

In spite of the weirdness of it, there is an upside to Mr. Blanchet’s gambit. In a likely unintended way, the leader of a party dedicated to Quebec independence has done a favour to Canadian democracy, by reminding voters that Mr. Trudeau leads a minority government, and that Parliament isn’t some vestigial memory of the Before Times.

Parliament, you say? What’s that?

It’s that institution in Ottawa that the Liberals have sidelined during the COVID-19 crisis.

Thanks to a Liberal motion supported by the NDP and the BQ, the House of Commons has been adjourned since March, except for emergency sessions to pass pandemic-related spending bills. Mr. Trudeau spent most of the crisis running the country by press conference outside his residence, free from the scrutiny of the House of Commons.

The only sop to accountability was a short-lived special COVID-19 committee that sat mostly by remote video technology. Opposition members were only allowed to ask questions about the pandemic; all other subjects were banned.

Story continues below advertisement

In short, the Liberals reduced Canada’s chief democratic institution to bystander status during the greatest public-health and economic emergency of modern times. And they did it with a minority government.

That’s just wrong. The Trudeau government has taken advantage of this crisis to rule as if it held a majority in Parliament. Mr. Blanchet’s threat of a no-confidence motion serves as an unexpected antidote to that, by reminding Canadian voters that this Prime Minister still has to answer to Parliament, and that the interests of our democracy come ahead of those of the Liberal Party.

For years to come, every one of us Canadians will need to help the country regain its equilibrium and recover from a COVID-19 pandemic that has punished our social and economic stability.

Canada needs the bedrock of a well-educated work force if it hopes to stay competitive and innovative, and universities shoulder a big responsibility for this. But as governments try to keep up with postpandemic needs, those universities – critical as they are to our future – will face steep challenges in sustaining progressive institutions that educate Canadians and attract thousands of students and leading thinkers from around the world.

Story continues below advertisement

A bigger role in upholding education will fall to all of us: communities, private supporters and the general public.

Supporting universities through planned giving – earmarking a donation in one’s will – is a visionary, unselfish investment that lets just about all of us help build a better future for our communities and our nation. Brock University just witnessed a remarkable example of this, thanks to the generosity of Stephanie Mitchell and her husband, Gerry.

Their lives were the stuff of a Hollywood movie: Gerry was a high-school dropout from St. Catharines, Ont., who became a highly successful global business leader. Stephanie grew up in Toledo, Ohio. With a love of literature, books and the arts, she returned to college in her mid-40s, earning bachelor’s and master’s degrees. Her pursuit of lifelong learning inspired the gift that she generously made at the end of her life.

University wasn’t an option for Gerry, and Stephanie had to wait until mid-life for her university experience, but both have made a sharp statement about the role education must play in shaping Canada and the world.

Both also clearly understood the shrewdness of planned giving.

Growing up in the 1940s, Gerry would walk along railroad tracks picking up pieces of coal to help heat the family home. Though the Second World War pulled Canada’s economy out of the Great Depression, life was hard for the Mitchells. His dad was in poor health, driving a taxi and working factory jobs. In 1943, at 16, Gerry quit school to take a job operating machinery in a local car parts plant.

He couldn’t have known, but that day was the start of an incredible journey.

Story continues below advertisement

Gerry was observant, intuitive. By 1957, he had been made superintendent. He was named plant manager in 1959, then director of manufacturing in 1961. In 1963 he became president of Hayes-Dana – the Canadian subsidiary of Dana Corp.

By 1967 he was executive vice-president at corporate headquarters in Toledo. The next year he was named chairman of the board at Hayes-Dana, then in 1972, president and chief operating officer of the global giant Dana Corp.

In 1980, the former teenaged machine operator became chairman and chief executive officer.

He could be gruff and intimidating, but had an ability to inspire people. When visiting a factory, Gerry refused the usual corporate entourage and insisted on walking the floor by himself. Renowned for remembering names, he would ask workers for suggestions – and listen to what they said.

Gerry had a philosophy of decentralized management, pushing responsibility out to the entire organization. His core principles were integrity and trust, and he used these to drive Dana Corp. to unprecedented growth.

Well into retirement, Gerry died in 2016. Stephanie passed away last December. When their estate was executed, it emerged that the coal-picking child of the Depression was more than a clever business person. He also recognized the importance of the kind of education that his family could never afford.

Stephanie directed a legacy gift of $2.7-million to Brock University, which had presented Gerry with an honorary doctoral degree 40 years ago, for his leadership in building the Niagara community.

As a result of Stephanie’s gift, Brock will create the Dr. Gerald B. Mitchell Centre of Excellence in Career and Experiential Education. Because of this donation, more students will be able to pair real-world work experience with their in-class education. Under-represented groups will have greater access to work-integrated learning, and our understanding of the best ways to combine work and education will deepen.

The funds will help future students pursue their passions through grants, resources and work opportunities that let them gain experience in their chosen fields.

Gerry Mitchell never attended university, but he seized upon the importance of education, and understood that cultivating knowledge gives a nation the ability to succeed. Stephanie Mitchell deeply understood the importance of education and its transformative power.

As Canada begins to dig itself out of a pandemic, this gift to education will help strengthen our future work force.

The WE Charity scandal has pretty much killed the federal government’s planned $900-million Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG) program. It’s probably fair to say that, in reference to a classic Monty Python sketch, it’s the dead parrot of summer relief programs.

But while the time for launching a summer program has passed, there is no reason the government could not develop a better one for the fall. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should ask the Canadian Armed Forces to do what WE cannot.

Story continues below advertisement

First, to avoid some of the mistakes brought to light by the WE fiasco, the government needs to be very clear what it means by “youth.” Part of the reason the CSSG went sideways was because of confusion over this critical point. The initial program announcement said it was for high-school graduates up to the age of 30. But asking WE, a charity that deals almost exclusively with children under 18, to administer the program seemed to signal something else.

People were, rightly, second-guessing the mandate from the start.

Fortunately, the CAF has expertise developing and administering programs for young people older than 18 and for youth under 18.

In the over-18 category, the CAF’s summer Bold Eagle program for Indigenous persons could serve as a model for a new initiative. Bold Eagle participants get all kinds of unique experiences, and can earn $4,200 in cash and academic credits. They have no obligation to stay in the armed forces when the program is over (though they are well-prepared to transfer into a reserve unit should they wish).

The CAF’s Full-time Summer Employment Program is another operation that could be used as a model for creation of an effective short-term youth development program that provides participants the opportunity to serve their communities, gain skills and earn money.

In response to the pandemic, the Prime Minister should immediately ask the CAF to develop a special reservist program for youth who have recently left high school. Such a program could work toward the original CSSG program goal of encouraging participation in national service and providing practical work experience and career development skills.

It could be short term (six or eight months) and, like the existing reserve programs, could allow participants to drop out at any time. The program would not be able to provide the usual sort of training and experiences that a typical reservist would experience in non-pandemic times. But the CAF is full of professionals who live by the motto “improve, adapt and overcome,” and an effective program could no doubt be created if they were asked to step up to the challenge.

Story continues below advertisement

In the under-18 category, if the government really was thinking of a program for youth still in high school, there is still time to address that audience, too.

Again, the CAF could be part of the solution since it already has about 5,000 Cadet Instructor Cadre officers administering the Cadet Program. These CIC instructors are specifically trained to work with youth between 12 and 18 and they come from all walks of life – some are veterans but many are accountants, software developers, teachers, entrepreneurs, musicians, mechanics, doctors, parents and so on.

The Cadet program – once described by Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan as “the best youth leadership program in the country” – already has more than 50,000 Canadian youth participating in it but could be scaled up to include more.

With many parents covering homeschooling duties in addition to their jobs, any program that helped engage youth in positive civic development would undoubtedly be welcomed support. Youth would also be able to earn high-school credits in return for their participation.

It is puzzling that the resources of the CAF were not immediately considered when developing the CSSG, or when thinking of ways to help Canadian youth positively respond to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In April, Mr. Trudeau used military metaphors to describe the challenge faced by the country. Now perhaps it is time to drop the metaphors and to ask the military what they can do to help. They are, after all, already on the payroll.

While the public’s attention has been focused elsewhere, the Trump administration has been pressing ahead in its attempt to crush a fellow sovereign state in the Americas: Cuba.

I am no apologist for the government of Cuba, and I believe the Cuban state, like all others, is accountable to all of its citizens. When I was Canada’s ambassador to Cuba, we had robust conversations with the Cubans on human rights and political reform in order to better understand each other. We certainly disagreed on some matters.

Story continues below advertisement

Cuba may not be top of mind in the face of so many pressing global issues, but the way in which the United States and Cuba deal with each other is a litmus test for larger issues: peace and stability in our hemisphere, how countries manage conflict, and the limits of the extraterritorial reach of domestic law (known in “diplomatic-speak” as bullying).

The Trump administration has torqued the U.S. trade and investment embargo against Cuba to unparalleled levels with a series of recent measures. The aim of some measures is to stir uncertainty among foreign companies, including Canadian ones, doing wholly legal business in Cuba. The efforts will effectively work to cripple investment and commerce in Cuba, and throttle the Cuban economy.

An element of U.S. embargo law was activated for the first time in April, 2019, which effectively handed over to certain Cuban Americans the ability to use the U.S. justice system to conduct lawsuits. As an unexpected consequence, several main targets of this exercise have been American companies doing legal business in Cuba. Having purposefully stirred a hornets’ nest, the Trump administration facilitated a legal assault on America’s own corporate citizens.

Other measures injure the well-being of everyday Cubans directly. For example, remittance transfers from the U.S. and elsewhere to recipients in Cuba have been choked by the Trump administration. Approximately 56 per cent of all Cubans depend on this money from family overseas.

The Trump administration’s approach to Cuba is characterized by a seemingly willful misunderstanding of how Cuban society is structured, in which the state provides many services to the population. There is an absence of concern from the White House about the effect of these heightened sanctions on individual Cubans.

The remittances are life-changing money transfers. Most of them pass through a Cuban financial entity belonging to a military holding company, before ending up in the pocket of the plumber or office worker who is waiting anxiously for the funds. If the remittance is blocked for political purposes, that money will simply never get to the pocket for which it was intended by a loving family member or friend.

The Trump administration has rationalized that its current intensification of an economic offensive against Cuba is necessary because of Cuba’s relationship with Venezuela. However, that narrative posits that Cuba can somehow control the behaviour of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the entire Venezuelan military and Venezuela’s national institutions, as though Cuba is a marionettist pulling the strings of a puppet. The idea strains credulity; Venezuela’s leaders are hardly thinking of Cuba when making their own policy decisions.

Story continues below advertisement

Each new sanction from the U.S. affects real people inside Cuba, especially during a global disease pandemic. This is not an abstraction, though it may seem that way for American policy makers safely ensconced far away in Florida or Washington.

Every time the White House celebrates economic damage to a foreign or Cuban company, it means individual Cubans lose their jobs and the essential livelihoods of entire families are effected. When remittances do not arrive, people in Cuba do not have the option of a backup plan. They are collateral damage in an American campaign to pressure their government regarding Venezuela, with no discernible endgame in sight.

By contrast, by the end of May, Cuba had sent 2,000 doctors and nurses to 23 countries battling COVID-19. Despite condescending criticisms from Washington, citizens and local dignitaries in the town of Crema in Italy applauded and cheered for a Cuban medical unit that had assisted with their pandemic response.

Cuba is far from perfect – but what country is? Cubans face many serious daily challenges, to be sure. But domestic politics inside Cuba itself will adjudicate the choices Cubans get to make for their futures. Setting aside the questionable goal of regime change in Cuba being pursued by the Trump administration, the additional hardship caused to the Cuban people along the way seems a high and unfair price to pay.

At the beginning of the pandemic, it seemed futile to talk about the history of sharing in Canada. How could the story of federal efforts to create a fairer nation possibly compete with news of health crises and government stumbles?

But then I realized: Now is the perfect time to explain how we came to share after decades of fierce disputes among the richer and poorer provinces and their weary citizens. Without sharing, we would not have national social programs. Without sharing, the federation might have disintegrated. Without sharing, we could not pull each other up or even trust each other and our governments throughout today’s pandemic.

Story continues below advertisement

The history of that crucial decision is tangled, crossing time to the pre-Confederation discussions of the 1860s, and crossing oceans to Australia, which hastily cobbled together a model program for sharing among states after disgruntled Western Australians voted to secede in 1933. Today we call our version of that approach by the fusty name of equalization. But the distribution of federal revenues from all taxpayers to the poorer provincial governments since 1957 has been a lifesaver that has enabled all provinces to provide adequate medical and social care through troubled times without exorbitant rates of taxation.

Equalization was not an easy sell to the wealthier provinces when prime minister Louis St. Laurent outlined his prudent approach in the mid-1950s. The federation had somehow survived to that point with a clumsy system of subsidies, which mostly purported to treat each province equally, but never really worked. Federal politicians surreptitiously manipulated the system to funnel more funds to the poorer provinces. The money was never enough. With the Great Depression, even the richer provinces could barely cope with relief payments for the jobless and their families. They wanted their taxpayers’ money for themselves, while the poorer provinces pleaded with Ottawa for any funds to dodge default.

The search for a better way attracted some of the most eccentric and talented Canadians of their generation, who argued, plotted and sometimes drank together. A Royal Commission even devised a convoluted model for sharing that was partly based on the Australian approach. Nothing worked. Politicians could not agree: They were angry with each other. But by the 1950s, impatient Canadians were demanding the good life promised after their sacrifices in the Second World War. They wanted hospital care, improved pensions, better post-secondary schools and, most of all, medicare. But the poorer provinces could not participate in national shared-cost programs without financial help. So St. Laurent created unilateral grants based upon the key tax revenues in two wealthy provinces, raising the poorer governments to the average of the richer ones. (Ottawa now uses fiscal capacity as a determinant.)

Today, equalization grants are the often overlooked ties that really bind Canadians to each other. During the pandemic, Ottawa and the provinces have created massive spending programs that target individual needs. But the existing equalization funding has already strengthened the social fabric, enabling poorer provinces to enhance their medical and social care in hard times.

The principle of sharing permeates our 21st-century federation. Until the pandemic, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney complained about Ottawa’s generosity to the poorer provinces: Alberta does not receive equalization because of its relatively high per-capita fiscal capacity. Now University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe calculates that “for the first time in 55 years, Alberta will be a net receiver in the federation.” (It will still not receive actual equalization because of its relatively strong economy, however.) Newfoundland and Labrador, which did escape reliance on equalization in this century, is now teetering on the brink of default. But whether through reforms to the equalization program or other transfers, Ottawa will almost certainly have to extend more aid to the floundering province; it has already guaranteed $7.5-billion in debt.

In contrast, the European Union, which is an uneasy monetary union but not a fiscal one, spent four acrimonious days in mid-July to agree upon an unprecedented stimulus package to help member countries to bolster their slumping economies. The recovery package is a mixture of grants and low-interest loans. Even then, the richer northern members were openly distrustful of how the poorer southern members would spend their windfall.

The often-fractious Canadian federation is certainly not without defects – and the now-convoluted equalization program is flawed. But since Ottawa sent out the first equalization cheques in April, 1957, that willingness to share has encouraged social unity and mutual trust. We save ourselves when we save each other.

The WE Charity scandal highlights an important principle that seems to have fallen out of fashion lately: Charities, government and politicians are not in the same business, nor should they be.

As is now well known, the Trudeau Liberals contracted WE Charity to deliver, on its behalf, the Canada Student Service Grant program. That decision has been widely panned on ethical grounds, specifically in relation to alleged conflicts of interest.

There are other questions raised here about the proper role of charities. Why do we have them, and are they becoming too enmeshed with government and politics?

Canadian law treats its approximately 90,000 registered charities with incredible favour. Registered charities are generally exempt from income tax. Qualifying donations to registered charities attract generous income-tax credits. These tax concessions cost the public treasury billions in forgone revenue every year. And that is just the tip of the iceberg. There are also property-tax concessions and innumerable other exemptions from onerous rules of law. All told, the law does a lot to promote the institution of charity.

Why do we invest so much in charities?

We presumably do not do this just so charities can deliver government programming as standby independent contractors. We have a capable government work force to do the work of government. Neither do we have charities to help brand politicians. We have political parties for that purpose.

Charities are about something different. Charitable donors establish and fund scholarships. They help remedy food insecurity. They fund medical research. They support the arts, museums, animal welfare, human rights, the environment, education, religion and so much more.

Governments have long since occupied many of these fields as well. But there is a big difference: Governments mandate financial contribution through compulsory taxation. Charities are about the voluntary choice to share with others outside of the government.

Having to pay (via taxes) and choosing to share (via donations) are fundamentally distinct avenues for the flow of money. Donors voluntarily make the morally valuable choice to tangibly affirm, through charitable giving, the equal worth, value and dignity of their end beneficiaries.

Story continues below advertisement

A large part of what we are endorsing through the promotion of charity is the other-centredness and voluntarism that lie at the heart of true charity. These are worth supporting. Of course, they are also the very things that get muted when charities become too entangled with government and politics.

While this entanglement has long been a concern, it has intensified in recent years.

In their first mandate, the Trudeau Liberals enacted tax reforms that effectively allow charities to operate as full-time lobbyists. Prior to that, charities could only engage in limited advocacy. Charities definitely have a valuable role to play in public policy development. But where is the charity if the only activity is advocating for governmental intervention?

Now through the WE Charity debacle, we see a continued blurring of the boundaries. This is certainly not the first time a government has utilized a charity for program delivery. But there is a whiff here of the use of charity for political branding. The political prize in this game may not have been outsourced efficiency, but rather the halo effect of the government’s public partnership with a well-connected progressive charity.

The political response throughout was that only by contracting with WE Charity could the government achieve its objectives. That, of course, depends upon how you define those objectives. If political branding was one of the goals, then the statement is true. But then so much for the other-centredness that defines true charity.

We would do well to keep charity, government and politics separate. Otherwise, charity risks becoming yet another limb of government or cog in the political wheel. And what, then, would be the point of it all?

Air of ire

Re Air Canada Overhauls Aeroplan Amid Travel Uncertainty (Report on Business, Aug. 12): So Air Canada is revamping Aeroplan in hopes of convincing Canadian travellers to remain loyal. But Canadians have little choice in remaining loyal to our national air carrier, owing to federal laws restricting foreign ownership of domestic airlines.

Some healthy competition would force Air Canada to improve its service, thereby encouraging loyalty without having to offer incentives to do so. The introduction of the Air Passenger Protection Regulations last year was thought to effect better service through the implementation of financial penalties for delays within the control of airlines. But because the regulations are enforced by airlines themselves, many Canadians find that they are denying compensation claims for a myriad of reasons.

Story continues below advertisement

My own claim is now with the Canadian Transportation Agency, where it lies among more than 3,000 complaints that flooded the office within the first months of the new regulations. I don’t expect a decision for years.

Canadians deserve better air service, and I believe that will only come when Ottawa takes the blinders off when it comes to protecting Air Canada.

Crunch time for classes

Re Unions Decry School Board’s COVID-19 Sick Leave Policy (Aug. 13): As stated by a Ministry of Education spokesperson, teachers and education workers in Ontario “benefit from the most generous sick leave program in Canada.” Unions should realize that’s 11 full salary days a year and 120 short-term leave days paid at 90 per cent.

Options for educators during the pandemic are there; options to teach in person or online are there. The recent Hospital for Sick Children report recommends kids go back to school for their academic and mental health. In this new-normal world, educators, as others, should also learn to adapt.

Re As Back-to-school Anxiety Mounts Across Canada, Parents Turn To Private Pods (Aug. 13): It’s not surprising to see parents take steps to ensure their children receive safe, meaningful education through “education pods” or other means. It’s also not surprising that this can lead to inequality, since many families can’t afford anything other than government-run schools. What is surprising is the silence around policies that would erase those inequalities: Give parents money for their children’s education.

At Cardus, we propose that families be offered funding to use in the school setting that works best for their kids. The lower a family’s income, the more money they’d receive.

We should implement policies that will give all families the resources to make school work this fall. Why should only wealthy parents have the freedom to do what’s best for their kids?

Re Toronto Schools May Not Be Ready In Time, Board Says (Aug. 14): When I look at the old brick fortresses attended by my grandchildren and thousands of other elementary-school students in Toronto, I see no way to make them safer in the next few weeks. With hot-water heating, they don’t even have HVAC systems to modify. Many have windows that can’t be opened after years of painting.

I understand there are tens of thousands of working-class parents who do not have the money to ride out keeping their children at home until it’s safe. This is a huge dilemma for which I have no slick solution.

I do know these parents should be supported financially and we should have more information about the time and cost of keeping our children safe at school. I’m pretty sure the federal government will need to help. Unsafe actions, mostly driven by our collective fear of hurting the economy, are not good enough.

Slammed shut

Re Carleton Criminologists Cut Student Internships With Police (Aug. 13): I am appalled that criminologists at Carleton University would follow such a disastrous social policy. It seems to me that the purpose of a university criminology department should be to learn about and suggest improvements in policing practices, not to limit and demonize the current method of keeping peace in our society.

Canada is one of the most peaceful and respectful countries in the world – I think we can thank our policing policies for this. I know, like everything else, policing in Canada can be improved. But while this is being continually done, I would thank police personnel for a tough job well done.

Jonathan Usher Toronto

I rarely lose my temper, but this move by criminologists at Carleton University leaves me dumbstruck.

I believe universities are supposed to prepare people to be excellent citizens, so that the next generation can tackle society’s problems, and some of them will become leaders who shake up existing structures.

Story continues below advertisement

However, it appears that these professors are hiding from their own responsibility for problems in policing. As some of the country’s brightest experts on criminology, isn’t it part of their jobs to advise and work with police-related organizations to uncover issues and resolve them?

I find their current decision to be a shallow and unhelpful response to a problem as important and complex as how we police.

Ed McDonough Toronto

It must be a sublime pleasure for Carleton University criminologists – with their secure positions and pensions – to know they may be blocking career opportunities for students by denying them a chance to work in the police and prison fields.

If, as they claim, these institutions are “rotten institutional structures,” wouldn’t it be preferable to send in newly woke students to fix the problems?

Conservative challenges

Re Scheer Offers Advice For His Replacement (Aug. 13): Andrew Scheer believes that a prime minister can be a social conservative, and that only the Trudeau Liberals demonize such views. As a card-carrying Conservative, I say that we lost the last election precisely because Mr. Scheer would not publicly support existing abortion rights and LGBTQ equality.

I am already convinced the Liberals will also win the next election, because some of Mr. Scheer’s would-be successors have stated that, as prime minister, they would allow backbench MPs to bring forth anti-abortion legislation. We are never going to beat the Liberals in this day and age, especially in the large cities and suburbs, until we finally make peace as a party with existing abortion rights and LGBTQ equality.

Pilot season

Re School Ventilation Systems Need Upgrading, Especially Amid COVID-19 (Aug. 13): Television producers should be clamouring to create a series based on the ongoing tragicomedy now playing out at Queen’s Park. It could be called “Seinford,” a show about nothing good.

An appropriate first episode would be about a character, let’s call him Doug, called “The Irony Ring,” focusing on a school-size version of the imaginary band of safety that worked wonders for so many of Ontario’s long-term care residents and migrant farm workers.

That could be followed by an instalment featuring one of his cohort, let’s call him Stephen, describing the painstaking planning, attention to detail and concern for the well-being of children that has gone into Ontario’s school reopening. This one could be titled “Let’s Give This A Shot, At Least.”

Undoubtedly, viewers would look forward to the spring of 2022, when the series finale (“The 43rd Ontario General Election”) will air, and where but a small minority would have said: “Gotta love the PCs.”

Tear down, build up

Re If We’re Cancelling Historical Villains, Why Not Norman Bethune? (Aug. 10): The call for statues to be taken down should not be one that begs the erasure of history, but instead one that demands a closer look.

At its core, it is an act of questioning who gets to write history and for whom it gets written. By confronting dominant narratives, we reveal the stories of those who have been oppressed and marginalized – stripping away the paint and seeing the tapestry before it becomes whitewashed.

When statues celebrating colonialists and slaveowners are removed, the acts should open space to examine cultural memory, not forget it. This is the way that we can hope to understand the traumas of the past, and work toward creating a more equitable present.

One nation under God?

Re The U.S. Presidential Election Is Blurring The Lines Between Saints And Sinners (Aug. 14): I have always been interested in reading about the development of the separation between church and state as part of Western civilization. It seemed to be one factor that enabled Britain to introduce religious tolerance as a government policy centuries ago. My sense is that this historical development was the major enabler of liberal democracy.

The separation of church and state is also the enabler of a robust realpolitik going back to Machiavelli. Contributor Michael Coren illustrates this point using the U.S. Attorney-General’s combination of a personal Catholic faith opposed to capital punishment with a public pursuit of policy furthering the death penalty. He must be putting the representation of his party’s voters first, for the “greater good.”

I would like The Globe to invite a Canadian historian to show, in our political culture, what factors have determined whether the separation of church and state has gone the route of liberal democracy or realpolitik as the predominant morality.

A quote about going to war over religion, in several permutations, has been attributed to many famous people including Napoleon, Yasser Arafat and Mark Twain.

Corporate conundrum

Re Taxes May Be The Prescription To Treat The Ailment Of The Coming Debt Crisis – But Which Taxes? (Report on Business, Aug. 10): Contributors Peter van Dijk and Glen Hodgson of the C.D. Howe Institute first describe higher personal taxes as harmful and inefficient, then recommend that consumption taxes (such as GST or HST) should be the progressive choice for supplementary government revenues. Pray tell, who are those consumers but us personal taxpayers!

If we are to make raising taxes to reduce debt a countrywide effort, each segment of our economic culture should carry its fair share of the load. For instance, corporate taxes now account for less than 15 per cent of the federal government’s combined total tax revenues, while personal taxes make up close to 50 per cent (and much more when consumption taxes are factored in).

Story continues below advertisement

Stephen Harper reduced the GST by two percentage points and cut corporate taxes from 22 per cent to 15 per cent, effectively removing about $20-billion to $30-billion a year from tax revenues – a good place to begin if this recovery plan is truly intended to equally share the pain.

Small-Ls

Re Canada Can’t Take Four More Years Of Trump (Aug. 13): If one goes back and forth over the border enough times, sooner or later one will encounter “liberal” Canadians who feel superior or more liberal than those of us on the southern side. Frankly, it should go both ways.

On the northern side, there have been two-and-a-half decades of nothing but white, male Liberal and Conservative leaders. Here, we have had one woman run for president, and two Democratic women and one Republican woman run for vice-president. Nancy Pelosi has been head of the Democrats in the House of Representatives. And we had a Black president.

So I challenge Canadians to beat that. Isn’t it time Canada caught up to the United States?

To hear it from oil sands critics, politicians and activists, Indigenous people in the oil sands are a contradiction. Surely, they cannot exist. Or if they do, they are surely victims of a predatory resource industry, or are colonized sellouts.

So I thought I’d share my own story.

Story continues below advertisement

I’m an Ojibwe woman. Life was very hard growing up. I was brought up in an abusive environment, and my family was mostly dependent on government assistance for income. I ran away from home several times as a teenager to escape this lifestyle. I did complete high school although there were only a handful of other Indigenous students in my graduating class. Most of my Indigenous peers quit at middle school. I eventually moved to the city, married young, went to college, which I paid for myself, had children and got divorced. I often worked two or three jobs to support my family and still struggled to make ends meet.

One day, I decided to apply to work in the oil sands in Fort McMurray. I didn’t know anyone there but I was determined to make a change – and yes, of course, as with almost any job, there were financial motivations. I applied to dozens of places even though I had no experience. Only one contractor showed interest, but that was enough to get me trained as a heavy equipment operator. I have since moved up, and now I work at a large company.

The thing that has always contributed to my work ethic was my upbringing and the racism I faced. Ever since I was a child, I’ve heard all the epithets and slurs: “lazy Indian,” “welfare bum,” and accusations that I was only hired because I’m Indigenous. The oil sands are certainly not immune to such thinking. But I’ve used these attacks to motivate me to work extra hard and not give anyone a reason to hold those negative comments against me.

It should be said, however, that the oil sands have evolved since I came here almost nine years ago. People seem more professional, and I’ve seen far less tolerance for racism. There are more women and non-Indigenous people of colour working on site. People who don’t understand the oil sands may hold perceptions that resource-industry workers are crude, uneducated and dirty people who don’t care about the environment, but from what I’ve seen, none of that is true.

There’s been growing concern about the violence faced by Indigenous women in this country, and that’s a good thing. But when people try to focus their energy to separate Indigenous women from the resource industry, that’s a mistake. I’ve never once felt unsafe while working here. For me, the best way to protect myself and to be independent is to give my family and myself the privilege of options in life – and for me, that has come from working in this industry.

My dream is to ultimately recruit, mentor and supervise Indigenous people to work in the oil sands with heavy equipment. I’d like to see more Indigenous women work in oil and gas, so we are not deprived of these opportunities to earn a good livelihood and support our families because other people are making decisions for us.





Story continues below advertisement

I’m tired of politicians and activists speaking about Indigenous people as if we only have one voice, one culture, one worldview. Everyone has the right to speak up for what they believe in. But we must stop speaking about Indigenous people as if we all fit one stereotype. Let’s work to support one another and empower our people to make their own choices. For me, Canada’s resource sector was a great choice, as it’s a great place to create opportunities, and I don’t want to see these jobs taken away from Indigenous people, or any Canadians.

I have broken the cycle of government dependency, violence and poverty. I have my own voice. I refuse to be a victim of my circumstances. Most of all, I have choices, and I choose to declare that I’m a proud Indigenous woman working in the oil sands.

The walking trail we’d been using since the pandemic had transformed our neighbourhood gym into a sterile prison was broad and flat, and I’d begun this particular March morning’s stroll by sprinting like a toddler, leaving my wife behind and feeling free and blissfully noncontagious, when her phone rang.

“Come back,” she shouted, ending the call. “I’ve decided.”

This was not a good sign. I knew her boss had planned to confront her with the same tough choice countless other Canadians had been forced to make recently. “Maybe you should think about this a bit more,” I suggested as I rejoined her. “We haven’t had our coffee yet.”

She smiled slightly, but the look on her face told me to prepare. It said I was about to discover, up close and personal, what happens to a happily unremarkable, largely untroubled life when one’s significant other becomes an essential worker in an existential fight nobody saw coming.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, public figures across Canada have extolled the courage and dedication of those who put themselves in harm’s way to keep the rest of us fed, clothed, sheltered and as healthy as possible. And rightly so. But the examples they’ve selected are, for the most part, seasoned professionals who are trained to deal with this sort of thing: paramedics, doctors, nurses.

My wife, Ruth, was none of these. She’d been two months into a part-time, semi-retirement gig at a Halifax grocer when she picked up that call from work. She had no special skills to offer, and no one would blame her if she quit. Still, her boss entreated, could she remain a little longer? Would she consider sticking around to “make things right” for folks?

I could think of a dozen reasons why she should not. There was the constant handwashing, clothes-laundering, the countertop-bleaching, for three. And that was just for openers.

“You think civilians have it rough,” I railed. “Just wait till you’re a bone fide foot soldier on the front lines of the COVID wars. What about your children, grandchildren, sister, nieces? While we’re at it, what about me? How ready do you imagine I am to contract one of the most perniciously virulent diseases in all of human history? What’s more, you don’t have to do this.”

She smiled again: “Yes. I do.”

There are approximately 175,000 minutes in four months. Since March, I’ve counted every one of them as the country’s regions, provinces, cities, towns and institutions have progressed through various stages of self-isolation, physical distancing and outright lockdown. Grocery stores do not, and never will, enjoy that option. They are, for lack of a more novel word, essential, and so are the people who work for them.

Naturally, then, I began my COVID-19 sojourn pretty much as I had expected: in nearly constant fear for my wife’s health, safety and well-being. But as day marched into night, and the various precautionary routines we had deployed seemed to hold up, I began to breathe again. Even more unexpectedly, I began to see the benighted world through my wife’s tender, tolerant eyes.

When pollsters phoned, I asked them how they were doing. When my lawyer demanded his money, I told the truth: It’s in the mail. I smiled at the Ford pickup truck with the lousy muffler. I talked to strangers.

I don’t recall the exact moment when I fully realized that I had been utterly wrong-headed about all of this. It might have been the time Ruth came home after a long shift to tell me the story about the customer who, after observing a woman ahead of her in line struggle with loose change, pulled out a credit card and paid the entire bill.

It might have been after I heard tales of the store’s staff rallying behind their colleagues faced with especially recalcitrant shoppers, or anecdotes about patrons flashing warm smiles and cracking jokes just to raise the level of civility in the joint.

It might have been after learning about these flashes of common virtue and any number of other tiny generosities – this way to a clean public toilet; that way to a better price; over there for a cash-only check out – that the truth about my wife finally dawned on me. She really is contagious, if patience, attentiveness, usefulness and compassion are communicable. I should be so lucky.

As Canadians, we may need to appreciate this more now as our children prepare to return to school and various provincial “bubbles” of relaxed social interaction inflate and test the limits of our thoughtfulness, but these are lessons in grace that have always been with us, waiting to be learned in whichever times we find ourselves.

Tomorrow, we’ll walk the trail again. This time, I’ll hang back a bit, and see if I can catch a little more of what’s going around, of what’s essential.

As the Democrats prepare for their quadrennial convention, the world’s oldest active political party – the philosophical home of Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy – is undergoing vast changes. Again.

Those changes go beyond the fact that, for the first time, this midsummer conclave is being held entirely remotely, with delegates confined to their dining-room tables, living-room sofas and basement bunkers. These transformations are happening in the character of the party, the content of its ideals and the coalition of its various interests. They are going on as the party leans left even as it girds itself to nominate a standard bearer whose instincts reside resolutely in the political centre. They are in train as the party seeks an awkward, almost certainly artificial, sense of unity in a desperate effort to wrest power from a President whose instinct is to divide.

“Parties change. The moment changes,” former secretary of state John Kerry, the Democrat’s 2004 presidential nominee, said in an interview. “And I hope we have changed in some respects. But this numb-skull nonentity in the White House won votes that are Democratic votes that we had taken for granted.”

The great defection of those very Democratic voters – grandchildren of the union members and immigrants who flocked to the party and its New Deal program to combat the Great Depression, and the children of the voters who stuck with the party during the tumult of the Vietnam War years – is what helped make Donald Trump president. And so the great, consequential question the Democrats face in their rump convention in the delegates’ homes, scattered from coast to coast: Can they win back those voters while still retaining the urban and university elites, minorities and women who increasingly have become the face of the new Democratic Party?

“Oh my God, there have been great changes,’' said former governor Michael Dukakis, who was the party’s 1988 presidential nominee. “Those of us who were big reformers in the 1960s and 1970s are the distant past for the whole new generation of new activists who are taking us in different directions, and taking us further. This is a time of change and we are looking at a very different party.’'

Indeed, the Democrats are in the throes of an enormous transition, in some ways mirroring the transitions in the broader American society; when the party’s putative nominee, former vice-president Joe Biden, selected Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate this week, he chose a woman who is both Black and South Asian and is married to a Jewish man – a vivid portrait of a changing country.

Moreover, Mr. Biden, 77, has acknowledged that he would be a “transitional” president – an inadvertently poignant self-description of a political figure who himself has undergone substantial change in an age of vast waves of change. In important ways, the Biden-Harris ticket is the personification of the transitions that have transpired in the party and in the country.

Mr. Biden was born into the New Deal voting bloc writ large, growing up with FDR as president in the blue-collar rail and coal-mining centre of Scranton, Pa. He graduated law school in 1968, the annus horribilis that included the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and senator Robert F. Kennedy and the riots outside that year’s Democratic National Convention. He was elected to the Senate in 1972, the year the Democrats overhauled their convention system to invite more women and Black Americans to power in the party. He presided over the bitter 1991 Clarence Thomas Supreme Court confirmation hearings that served as a precursor to the Me Too movement.

Two numbers underscore the changes in the Democratic Party and in American politics. In the election after the birth of Mr. Biden, his native Pennsylvania county sided with the Democratic ticket led by Roosevelt, by an 11-point margin. Just four years ago, Mr. Trump came within four percentage points of winning there – and captured Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes. Today, the Scranton area – along with the suburbs around Pittsburgh and Philadelphia – may be the most important battleground in U.S. politics.

The Democratic Party that is undergoing such fundamental change was itself the party that fought change through the last half of the 19th century and sporadically in the 20th. The Democratic Party that is now rooted in the cities and in the North was the party of the South until the mid-1960s. The Democratic Party that was the vanguard of racial change in the civil-rights era and again in the age of Black Lives Matter was the party that fought integration – indeed, was unabashedly the party of white supremacy – after the Civil War and as late as the early 1960s. The Democratic Party that today speaks of increased Washington intervention in the economy and health care was the party that fought big government for decades.

The party that relied on white voters from the lower strata of 19th-century America is today struggling to win back the support of what political professionals call “non-college whites.” And the party that is today congenial to elites was the ultimate enemy of the nation’s elites at the end of the 19th century and into the early years of the 20th century, when three-time presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan inveighed against privilege and spoke of “the avenging wrath of an indignant people.’'

“We used to run against the elites,” said former vice-president Walter Mondale, who was the Democratic presidential nominee three-quarters of a century after Mr. Bryan’s last campaign. “Ivy League faculties didn’t vote for us. We didn’t fit. But they are voting for Democrats now.”

Several key moments of change stand out. One was in 1924, when, in a marathon 17-day convention that required 103 ballots to select a presidential nominee, the party deadlocked on whether to condemn the Ku Klux Klan. Four years later, with the first Catholic presidential nominee, the Democrats won the 10 biggest cities in the country; they had lost all 10 in the 1920 election. By 1964, when Congress was debating the Civil Rights Bill, the Southern mastodons of the Democratic Senate – avowed racists – discovered they could not muster the filibuster needed to kill the legislation.

“It was a slow evolution, driven in part by demography – by the growth of diversity in the country – and by the changing nature of the economy,” said Bruce Schulman, a Boston University historian. “By 1936, the Democratic coalition as we know it had taken shape, identified with liberalism and with activist government.” That was the year of FDR’s 46-state landslide, the first time a Democrat had enough support nationwide to win the White House without a single Southern electoral vote.

The fissures in today’s Democratic Party have been bridged in part by time, and in part by the Trump phenomenon.

It has been six months since the most recent multiple-candidate Democratic debate. Since then, Mr. Biden has vanquished his rivals. Meanwhile, the coronavirus – as well as the protests and revival of awareness of Black pain prompted by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis – have dominated the news, blunting the effect of the differences among Democrats, but not eliminating them.

But the Democratic debates – 11 in all, the first coming 14 months ago with 20 candidates tangling in a two-night format – put the party’s divisions in sharp relief. And in every one of those sessions, Mr. Biden stood at the centre of the proceedings, not by virtue of his strength as a candidate – in truth, through most of the primary season it was his weakness, not his strength, that attracted the most attention – but by virtue of his Goldilockian political porridge: not too hot, not too cold. The battle lines swiftly took on an overarching theme: How much change did the modern party of change want, and how much could it stomach?

That debate can be distilled into one sentence, uttered by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and directed at a moderate with views not so different from Mr. Biden’s, former Representative John Delaney of Maryland: “I don’t understand why anyone goes to all the trouble of running for President of the United States,” she said, “to tell us what we can’t do and shouldn’t fight for.”

Ms. Warren – along with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who was the last of Mr. Biden’s rivals for the nomination when he dropped out of the race in April – saw the Trump phenomenon as an opening for major change in the party and, if successful, in the country. Understanding that the party eventually would unite against just about anyone – lawn signs Democrats placed throughout the country urged the election of “Any Functioning Adult 2020” – the pair calculated that this was the year to work for fundamental change: a broad centralized health-insurance scheme to cover all Americans, far-reaching environmental structures to fight global climate change, dramatic changes in the tax code to battle the wealth gap. The two New England lawmakers spoke of revolution, and they meant it. “If there is going to be class warfare in this country,” Mr. Sanders said at the AFL-CIO union’s convention last year, “it’s time that the working class of this country won that war and not just the corporate elite.”

At the same time there was ferment in the Democratic grassroots – ferment that continued throughout this summer.

Last month, Jamaal Bowman, a progressive insurgent, upset Representative Eliot Engel of New York, the powerful 16-term incumbent who was chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, in a Democratic primary. It was the third example in two years when a progressive candidate of colour toppled an urban establishment liberal in a Democratic primary.

His victory, combined with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s 2018 unexpected win over former fourth-ranking House Democrat Joseph Crowley in New York and Ayanna Pressley’s defeat of Michael Capuano of Massachusetts, laid bare the growing ideological and generational tensions in the party.

This new rebellion has all the potential power of the liberal insurgency of the 1960s, which G. Calvin Mackenzie and Robert Weisbrot described as “The Liberal Hour” in a landmark 2008 book of that title.

“Today there’s an agenda that resembles the 1960s in some ways – the Green New Deal and Medicare-For-All,” said Mr. Mackenzie, an emeritus political scientist at Maine’s Colby College.

“But the forces of resistance – the vise-hold that special-interest groups and social media have – are far stronger than the resistance in the 1960s. Getting the magnitude of legislation that we had in the 1960s is extremely difficult and unlikely today.”

For months, Mr. Biden resisted the entreaties from the left. He calculated that he was the “remainder man,” the candidate who would be left standing after Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren cancelled each other out and as the other moderates in the field – former mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota – faded.

That worked, but not without a large boost from Black voters in South Carolina and in the state primaries that followed. And as Mr. Biden moved closer to his apparent nomination, it became clear that he had to court the contenders to his left and, perhaps more importantly, their supporters.

Part of that was hard; Mr. Biden had to inch left on health insurance (he is now supporting Medicare for those at the age of 60, five years earlier than current law) and climate change (his is a Pale-Green New Deal). But part was not so difficult at all. Mr. Biden’s blue-collar roots and the party’s post-1932 profile make that a natural.

“Coronavirus and the economic meltdown have cast the Green New Deal and Medicare For All in a different light,” said Democratic Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts. “These things don’t seem so radical any more.”

Democratic strategists are arguing that, with Mr. Biden at the top of the ticket, the party’s leadership is no more elite than that of the Republican Party, and they’re emphasizing the party’s heritage as representatives of those at the bottom of the economic ladder.

“The party is interested in helping out people in the middle and lower classes,” said Molly Michelmore, a Washington and Lee University historian. “Very few people are paying much attention to the very poor, but if anybody is, it’s the Democrats.”

Ordinarily, a struggle like the one that the two-dozen 2020 Democratic candidates engaged in would have played out in raucous midsummer platform hearings and in a colourful convention scene. But the virus has drained the colour from customary political activity, and the level of antagonism against the President has prompted Democrats to focus on their differences with Mr. Trump rather than their hesitations about Mr. Biden.

“We need a united front in this emergency and against this president,” said Edward Widmer, a Bill Clinton speechwriter who teaches at the Macaulay Honors College of City University of New York. “But progressives have qualms about centrist policies, and centrists have qualms about the progressives. The party will unite to defeat the President, but if Biden wins there will be fights among Democrats about which way to go next.”

That is, to borrow the title of an influential 1963 James Baldwin book about the sort of racial injustice that Americans are examining 57 years later, the fire next time. For now, and at this convention, it is only smouldering.

So long, Scheer

Re Scheer Offers Advice For His Replacement (Aug. 13): I would like to thank Andrew Scheer for his service to the Conservative Party and to Canada.

Hopefully he will remain in politics, as I find he has performed nobly as House Speaker and Conservative Leader. It cannot have been an easy time for him, filling in while a new leader is to be declared, but he soldiered on.

His conduct made me think of a line from Robert Burns’s A Man’s A Man For A’ That: “The honest man … is king o’ men for a’ that.” In short, Mr. Scheer suffered his lumps and took it on the chin. His actions, as I see them, serve a sharp contrast to Justin Trudeau.

Circling back

Re Three Years Ago, Gun-Law Loopholes Paved The Way For A Rampage in B.C. Why Has Nothing Changed? (Aug. 8): The crux of this story seems painfully obvious: a mentally ill individual was able to purchase a firearm and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in Canada, then goes berserk. To attribute the ensuing rampage to a legal technicality – one that enables 10-round pistol magazines to be used in five-round rifles – feels disingenuous. In fact, pistol-calibre firearms have significantly less power, lower accuracy and shorter range than conventional rifles.

This person could have affected more mayhem with a perfectly legal 25-round magazine in a .22 rimfire rifle. And the potential for lethal carnage would have increased had he used a five-round capacity, full-bore military surplus or commercial hunting rifle. As well, the shooter could have caused multiple vehicle wrecks and injuries had he chosen to wield a shotgun with buckshot or slugs.

All in all, I find his choice of a legislative “loophole” rifle to wreak havoc was far from the most advantageous strategy.

Bert van Ingen Nepean, Ont.

The perpetrator of this rampage purchased a firearm from a store without a valid Possession and Acquisition Licence and was likely not qualified to renew it. The RCMP investigation “deemed that all store policies were followed and no charges were laid.” This is outrageous to me.

Story continues below advertisement

The PAL was designed precisely to prevent the sale of firearms to persons that are not considered by the RCMP to be capable of safely handling, storing and using them, which this individual was clearly not. The RCMP are supposed to ensure such regulations are followed.

I believe this episode had nothing to do with the type of gun and everything to do with the failure of the store clerk, who should have been properly trained by management. It’s clear to me that store policies were not followed, as they would not have been able to sell firearms without having these policies front and centre.

The PAL is an excellent tool, when properly used, and I doubt any law-abiding gun owner would disagree with its main purpose.

Re How Broken Systems Allowed Matthew McKnight To Get Away With Sexual Assault For Years (Opinion, Aug. 8): The account of the offences of Matthew McKnight against his victims is indeed horrific. However, contributor Karlee Kobasiuk refers to white male privilege no fewer than four times. Are we to assume that only privileged white men are getting away with sexual assault due to our “broken systems?”

Sexual violence is and always has been a crime that knows no boundaries in terms of race, ethnicity or economic background. I believe it does no one any service to point a finger at white men as being the only ones who benefit from our failure to protect women.

Bye, bye, baby

Re The Coming Baby Bust (Opinion, Aug. 8): While I agree with columnist John Ibbitson and contributor Darrell Bricker on the significance of accepting newcomers into Canada, I can’t help but think of the countries they are leaving behind.

Whether a person is coming to Canada for economic reasons, to flee persecution or to reunite with family, we should also understand what their country of origin is losing, not just what Canada is gaining. In a global society, wouldn’t it be better if all countries had a chance to prosper? I’m not sure how that happens if the best and brightest minds of so many countries move here.

It seems immigration solves some of our problems, but adds long-lasting ones elsewhere in the world.

Nathan Stoffman Toronto

I am a strong proponent of immigration, but what John Ibbitson and Darrell Bricker argue for seems to be a beggar-thy-neighbour population policy.

Story continues below advertisement

If there really won’t be enough young people to go around when the global population starts to decline, then the only true solution would be to adapt our systems so they don’t depend on youth. From that point of view, immigration can only ever be a temporary stopgap.

The real argument for immigration is that free movement should be a right. No state should be permitted to tie people to its soil – even when the soil in question is as expansive as Canada’s. But, to deal with declining global fertility, we need to change our societies so they don’t depend on exponential population growth.

Word on the street

Re The Artful Flogger (Arts & Pursuits, Aug. 8): After spending 50 years in enemy territory in the book publishing business, I have rarely read such a compelling portrait of a would-be novelist as reporter Ian Brown’s of Crad Kilodney, the late outlaw of Canadian letters.

The pain and depth of his exile from any recognized publication is remarkable. Behind his desperate search for establishment endorsement, I see a lonely soul trying to make a place for himself, in an unsuccessful way, in the CanLit world.

I think he may have been our own Willy Loman. If you remove all the bluster, I think Crad Kilodney was a nice guy who wanted to be loved and appreciated, perhaps for the wrong reasons. Finally, we have an anti-hero who we can all appreciate.

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE/The New York Times News Service

MJ Banias is a Winnipeg-based journalist and the author of The UFO People: A Curious Culture. Follow MJ on Twitter @mjbanias.

In April, 2019, a Sunwing airliner was on approach into Toronto’s Pearson International Airport when it was ordered by air traffic control operators to climb in altitude because an unknown aircraft had entered into its flight path. The Sunwing pilots reported that the “target appeared momentarily to them then disappeared.” Two months later, in June, an airliner on final approach to the St. Hubert airport near Montreal was notified by air traffic control of “unidentified traffic.” The airliner’s collision avoidance system confirmed the object was roughly 3.5 nautical miles ahead of the aircraft and climbing in altitude to 2,700 feet. The pilots eventually made visual contact as the object continued to gain altitude and crossed into controlled airspace without radio contact or clearance from air traffic control. A month later, air traffic controllers in Langley, B.C., reported to Transport Canada that “radar targets were coasting in and out to the Northwest (NW) of the airport” and “Random targets popping up, radar tags swapping, targets jumping to random locations.”

The recently released 2019 Canadian UFO Survey indicates Canadians see about two or three unidentified flying objects a day, and while many will laugh UFOs off as being a silly fringe delusion, several sighting events reported to Transport Canada present in the 2019 survey, such as those outlined above, involve pilots coming into close proximity with unknown aerial objects, and indicate a clear risk to air safety. While the U.S. government is actively investigating UFO reports and Congress is calling for more public oversight on unknown aerial incursions, the Canadian government seems to be doing nothing.

It is easy to dismiss UFOs, or as they are called today, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Nearly a century of mass media has turned a curious phenomenon into a tinfoil hat-wearing enterprise filled with extraterrestrials, martian invasions and far-future technology. It is unlikely that pilots are being harassed by pop culture aliens in flying saucers. However, our southern neighbours seem to be concerned with the fact that something is zipping around North American airspace and no one seems to know how to deal with it.

A recent congressional report indicates that the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence has an active task force that investigates incursions of UAP into U.S. airspace. Recently, Senator Marco Rubio, who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, introduced a congressional bill giving this intelligence-gathering operation 180 days to disclose its findings regarding these incursions. The Americans seem to consider this an important issue that needs more attention.

Canadian science writer and researcher Chris Rutkowski, who diligently collects nearly all of Canada’s UAP reports from civilian research organizations and those reported to Transport Canada, told me that Canada is experiencing a “possible public safety issue.” While Canada has had 849 reports in 2019, somewhat lower than the usual yearly average, Mr. Rutkowski disclosed that a more in-depth look into Transport Canada’s Civil Aviation Daily Occurrence Reporting System, known as CADORS, seems to portray that pilots have been reporting unknown objects frequently within Canadian airspace for decades. While many of those sightings can be attributed to misidentification or commercial drones and quadcopters, some reports defy prosaic phenomena.

One 2012 air incident report indicates that a Chinese Eastern Airlines Airbus was flying over Alberta when the pilot spotted an unknown object 40 nautical miles to the south, at 41,000 feet. Most commercial drones cannot even get close to that kind of altitude. Another incident in 2015 occurred over Saskatoon’s international airport, where the pilot notified air traffic control that they witnessed a bright white light above their aircraft at roughly 34,000 feet. Two flight attendants were injured in 2016 when a Porter flight landing in Toronto nearly collided with an unknown object over Lake Ontario at 9,000 feet. The Transportation Safety Board was unable to identify what caused the incident. In 2019, several aircraft over the vicinity of Medicine Hat reported multiple unidentified objects above their aircraft. In September, 2019, at roughly 2:00 p.m. EST, an unidentified aircraft buzzed the Kitchener/Waterloo radar control zone at 2,100 feet without clearance. Several other similar cases have occurred over the past decade. These incidents beg an important question: What is the Canadian government doing about them? Seemingly, very little.

“We have no idea if UFO reports are investigated,” explained Mr. Rutkowski. Transport Canada investigates air incidents, such as near misses or crashes. However, when pilots witness unknown aerial objects and radar operators are unable to identify them, Transport Canada told me that cases such as these are considered “only advisory” and “not investigated.” Transport Canada explained that all sightings or encounters concerning unknown aircraft are under the jurisdiction of Nav Canada.

When pilots witness “unidentified flying objects,” they are requested to make “aviation occurrence” reports to the regional Flight Information Centre in “the interests of national security,” according to regulations published by Nav Canada, a private non-profit organization that handles all Canadian air navigation services. These reports are known as “Communication Instructions for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings.” In an e-mail, Nav Canada’s media relations manager Brian Boudreau said examples would include “sightings of aircraft violating operating parameters, unidentified aircraft, unauthorized aircraft or any activity that may impact flight safety or pose a security threat.”

Depending on the details of the incident, Nav Canada may send a report to the Department of National Defence, the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD), Transport Canada or the American Federal Aviation Administration.

A spokesperson from the Department of National Defence said all reports of unknown aerial vehicles are reported via Nav Canada’s procedure, including sighting reports made by military personnel. In a dizzying turn of double-speak, although Nav Canada collects UFO reports to assess potential security threats, an e-mail from the DND read:

""We wouldn't really comment on speculative matters such as this. The Canadian Armed Forces concerns itself with credible threats, and this falls outside the scope of our operations.""

In an attempt to gain more answers, this journalist filed a formal Access to Information Request concerning access to all reports involving “incursions made by foreign unknown aircraft” into Canadian airspace for the past two decades. “Speculative matters” aside, the DND responded that it “neither confirms or denies records exist …” and that “if documentation did exist, it is exempted in its entirety” from Access to Information Requests owing to national defence.

“The government was mostly uninterested in UFOs; they really wanted the whole thing just to go away,” explained Matthew Hayes in an interview. Dr. Hayes is a filmmaker and researcher whose 2019 PhD dissertation, “A History of Canada’s UFO Investigation, 1950-1995,” stated that while some individuals within the government take the issue seriously, “most efforts were put toward debunking the subject.”

Dr. Hayes was not surprised by the military’s response to my UAP question. In 2017, a DND spokesperson sent the CBC an image of a flying saucer when responding to their press query concerning the phenomenon.

“There were many attempts over the years and decades to ignore the UFO phenomenon and requests for information about UFOs, as something outside the scope of the department or agency,” Dr. Hayes stated.

The U.S. military has publicly admitted that unknown aerial objects are making incursions into sovereign airspace. In 2017, begrudgingly, it was forced to provide three pieces of video footage of unknown objects filmed by naval aviators piloting F-18 Super Hornets. They were attempting, albeit unsuccessfully, to engage these aircraft. The U.S. Navy has also changed its policies for its personnel and is moving to reduce the stigma around reporting sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena. Jokes over aliens and flying saucers do not seem to be on their minds when their best pilots and aircraft cannot keep up with whatever these unidentified aircraft are. The concern is far more severe. American politicians and intelligence experts have publicly expressed their opinions that a foreign adversary may have developed a superior system of propulsion or technology that can trick complicated radar and video recording systems. Alternatively, this phenomenon may be something else entirely. Regardless, the United States is taking this issue seriously. Looking into the various assortment of reports present in the CADORS flight safety system indicates Canada ought to take it seriously as well.

“In the past, the Canadian government has certainly tried to take its lead from the U.S. when it comes to UFO information,” Dr. Hayes explained. “There are several documented instances of minutes from committee meetings, or interdepartmental memos, of Canadian officials uncertain about what to do, and deciding to wait to see what the Americans do.”

Mr. Rutkowski said that while Canada has seen a reduction in sightings in 2019, 2020 has seen a dramatic increase in the first few months. While the various Canadian governmental agencies attempt to make light of unidentified aerial phenomena, the data indicate this issue is not going away. Perhaps now that the U.S. is beginning to look at the issue of UAP more seriously, Canada will follow suit. Governments and militaries are not comfortable with unknowns. They are potential threats to a nation. When the role of the government and the military is to protect that nation, pretending something does not exist is more politically palatable than admitting there has been an intelligence failure.

That being said, if anything can be drawn from the Department of National Defence’s response to inquiries regarding this subject, perhaps they do not consider the implications of unknown aircraft making incursions into Canadian airspace as being a “credible threat.”

I know what you’ve been going through these past five months; it’s the same thing we’ve all been going through.

Stripped both of structure and spontaneity, a day could feel like a week and a week like a month, yet two hours could evaporate in a puff of anxiety as you googled COVID-19 symptoms and compulsively streamed The Great British Bake Off. It was always 7 p.m. on a Sunday, no matter what day of the week it actually was. Confined inside for days on end, you came to loathe the colour of your bathroom, the texture of your carpet, the sound of your upstairs neighbour walking above you. No matter how essential the errand, leaving your home made you feel both anxious and guilty.

Now, the game is changing again. For better or for worse, things are reopening; Toronto, one of the hardest hit cities in the country, recently entered “stage three,” meaning bars, movie theatres and restaurants are open. Although everything still has a faint, palpable air of dread – the lull in a horror movie where the plucky teens foolishly believe they’ve escaped the monster and the viewer, helpless, is just waiting for it to come crashing back on screen – the stranglehold of total social isolation is loosening for many people. The fear and worry and loneliness are still there, but blunted by changing circumstances and normalization.

But that other thing, that quieter ache – that smouldering coal deep in your chest you fear would ignite and devour you if you dug it out and examined it – that’s still there. If anything, that pain might be sharper, more acute than before.

That feeling is grief.

We can go out and get a coffee, we can walk in the park, we can drink a beer on the patio, but it doesn't really matter.

The world we knew is gone.

The life you thought you were going to have is gone.

The lives we all thought we were going to have are gone.

And, maybe, that’s a good thing. A good – and very hard – thing.





Since COVID-19 first emerged sometime toward the end of 2019, more than 741,000 people have died and 20 million have been infected, with 121,000 infections in Canada alone. With people locked into their homes, sick or afraid of getting sick, the economy came to a grinding halt, a shockwave of lost jobs and reduced or redistributed consumer spending. Canada lost around two million jobs in April, with the hardest hit – outside of people who were already un- or underemployed – being low-wage workers, of which women and younger people comprise a large portion, groups that were already at an economic disadvantage in the Before.

Those jobs aren’t just going to just magically reappear as we reopen; COVID-19 has reshaped consumer demand and will continue to do so into the future. Many small businesses – restaurants in particular – are permanently closed, and it will take time for something to replace them, if such a thing will even be possible in the near future.

Things aren’t going to go back to “normal.” There’s no “normal” to go back to.

More importantly, this pandemic has kicked open the factory doors of our culture and allowed us to see how the sausage is made: on the backs of the people whose labour, time and bodies we deem to be worth at or around minimum wage, but without which we absolutely could not – cannot – make it through this crisis.

Current conversations around the “safety” of going back to work right now are simply not for the lower classes. While many middle and upper class people worked from home, working class wage earners – grocery store clerks, delivery drivers, food and agriculture folk – continued on as “essential workers,” dispensing and producing the goods and services on which our entire culture runs, all the while risking continuous public exposure. They went to work – and continue to go to work – because they have to, and will continue to have to, even as we see infections spike, something we should prepare to happen, given what we are seeing in other nations, such as Germany and Australia.

For the working class who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic, discussions around CERB – which some claim is a disincentive for people to return to work – and how some people, particularly millennials, spend that money, only serves to make the deep-seated class divide in this country more apparent. If $2,000 a month – about $12.50 an hour, or around $24,000 a year before taxes for a full-time worker – means that people are making more money than they were before, the problem is not CERB, but that workers are not fairly compensated for their labour with a living wage. Anyone who would weigh in critically on how that money is spent, moreover, should ask themselves if they believe that only the wealthy deserve financial autonomy, and the pleasure and dignity of human comforts, or if CERB is really just a subsidy for landlords.

That these are even conversations to be had demonstrates a tremendous failure of understanding – and compassion – about the realities of working class life, and the message it sends is clear: Get back to work, plebes.

The destabilizing effect of this pandemic has laid bare the economic inequality on which our society functions. Class disparity, the resistance to universal income, systemic racism, the militarization of the police and the rhetoric of the current political climate are not the result of the pandemic; they are the endgame of capitalism. We’ve merely paused the machine long enough to see them clearly.





This is my own tiny, selfish dream:

Story continues below advertisement

I want to meet a nice femme and get married and have a modest house with a little yard. I want to make my future wife coffee in the morning and kiss her goodbye, and go off to work writing articles and books, because it’s a useful occupation that makes me happy. I want to take my breakfast in a diner on Sundays while I read the paper, and make my wife laugh, and put butter on hot, fresh bread, and throw a ball for my dog. I want a couple fingers of whisky, clean sheets and a book when I go to bed at night.

My dream, in short, is to have enough, with the time to enjoy it. To have a life that has love and dignity.

It’s so small, when you say it like that, but for so much of my life it has seemed impossibly out of reach. At the beginning of March, things were finally starting to look up for me; that dream felt a little bit closer. When the pandemic hit, every certainty I had worked so hard to build for myself was swept from the table.

Now, here in August, that dream feels even further away than before. I don’t know what your own little dream is, but it probably feels distant – perhaps even unreachable – now, too.

I’m really sad about it, and I think we should be allowed to be sad right now.

Grief is a chance to get a hold of that hurting thing, to look at it fully and carefully, to take what’s left of what you’re grieving for and make it into a part of yourself you can take with you.

Story continues below advertisement

Grief isn’t about expulsion and denial. It’s about consumption and reflection.

Things are scary. We are allowed to be anxious and afraid right now.

We have lost a world. You’ve got permission to grieve.

But in doing that, we might ask if the world we have lost is really as good as we remember, if it was serving the life we hoped we would have. I’m working class. I’ve experienced homelessness and poverty. I’m queer. I’m non-binary. I’m female. I know – have known for most of my adult life – that in this world some bodies are worth more than other bodies. Some lives are worth more than other lives. Some happiness is worth more than other happiness.

What we are seeing, now, in this crisis, is a perfect distillation of that, of the ways the world before did not serve – did not care about – everyone equally. This is a chance to rethink that; perhaps not only can we not return to the world before this, but maybe we don’t really want to.

Capitalism demands constant, accelerating growth; a black magic trick that flies in the face of nature, in which no such thing exists. Even SARS-CoV-2 – itself a phenomena of nature – must adhere to these rules, and in many ways the virus is a metaphor for capitalism itself. It seeks perpetual increase without regard for the host organism, and eventually it will reach a point where it can no longer continue its present rate of infection; either it will use up all its resources (all the host organisms are all already infected or dead) or it will be contained or even eradicated by adaptations on the part of the host (that’s us).

Story continues below advertisement

That we see, plainly, how fragile and unfair our way of life really is, is part of the collective grief. Even if we did all agree to go back to the way things were, they can never actually really be that way; the illusion has been dispelled.

So go ahead and grieve now. Think carefully. Fill in the holes the world before has left.

Adapt.

Be good to your neighbours and friends. Take care of them as best you can. Don’t let them go without, if it’s possible. We’re going to need each other more than ever.

It will take a lot of hands to build a new and better world with new and better lives for each of us.

Canada needs the public health equivalent of Own the Podium.

At the Montreal Olympics in 1976, Canada became the first host nation to fail to win a gold medal. It repeated the feat 12 years later, in Calgary. After that, the country’s amateur sports program took a hard look at itself. A generation later, in Vancouver in 2010, Canadian athletes won 14 gold medals – a record for most first-place finishes, ever, by any country at a Winter Olympics.

Canada today has to shoot for something similar, only on a much more important field.

Round 2 against COVID-19 begins now. Canada’s goal for the coming months should be to make this country the world leader at returning to a high level of economic activity, while maintaining a low level of COVID-19. Getting Canada back on its feet, while keeping the pandemic on the floor, will not be easy, but it is possible. A new study published this week in the Canadian Medical Association Journal suggests how.

Researchers with the Public Health Agency of Canada modelled four different “interventions” aimed at preventing new waves of infections. They concluded that, if Canadians continue to practise prudent physical distancing, and if governments simultaneously up their game on testing and contact tracing, it should be possible to keep infection levels low.

Studies like these are always to some extent guesstimates, since what is being modelled – millions of people having billions of interactions – is so exceptionally complex. What’s more, as the researchers note, “key epidemiologic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 remain unknown.”

Nevertheless, based on what is known, the researchers estimate that if Canada were to do nothing, 64.6 per cent of Canadians would become infected with COVID-19 over the next year and a half. If Canadians continue to practise physical distancing to the same degree as today, and if governments continue to test, contract trace and isolate cases with the same degree of success as now, then the spread of the virus’ will be reduced, but only slightly.

However, the study says that, if governments up their game, the expected infection rate will plummet.

Canadian public health authorities currently detect and isolate only 20 per cent of people infected with COVID-19, according to the researchers, and are only able to track down 50 per cent of those people they came into contact with. That’s because many infected people have mild symptoms or none, and they consequently never know that they are infected. Our testing and contact-tracing systems are only seeing – and quarantining – the tip of the iceberg.

But what if they saw more? The study estimated what would happen if public health authorities were able to consistently identify 50 per cent of the infected, and track down 100 per cent of their contacts. With “enhanced case detection and contact tracing,” the expected infection rate would fall to just 0.4 per cent of Canadians.

And if better gumshoe sleuthing by public-health authorities were paired with millions of individual Canadians continuing to practise physical distancing, the projected infection rate falls to just 0.2 per cent.

Again, this is just a model; these predictions come with no money-back guarantees. Nevertheless, they represent a reasonable take on the current state of an evolving understanding of how best to prevent the spread of this virus.

The study suggests that Canadians must still do their part, by keeping their distance, wearing masks (the impact of which is not considered by this study), and not getting together in large groups.

But beyond that, returning life to something close to normal, without reinvigorating the virus, is up to governments. They’ve got to make the right choices, and among those is devoting sufficient money, intelligence and obsessive attention to detail to enhancing the nation’s capacity for testing and contact tracing.

If public-health authorities do not up their game, by finding and isolating a much higher share of future COVID-19 cases and contacts, then the study suggests that the health of the economy, and of Canadians, will again be in jeopardy.

Unless and until there is a vaccine, beating COVID-19 will not be about one big thing. It will be about many little things, diligently repeated, millions of times.

This broader insensitivity to systemic racism is part and parcel of the issues in our police.","Richard Fadden is a former national security adviser to the prime minister, director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, deputy minister of national defence and deputy clerk of the Privy Council.

It is now beyond reasonable debate that the issue of systemic racism in our law-enforcement institutions must be seriously addressed. This is not to suggest that every police service is equally flawed, or that every officer acts unacceptably, consciously or not; indeed, we must avoid ascribing all of society’s ills to the police who serve us, lest we throw the baby out with the bathwater, and ignore how other social institutions also contribute to systemic discrimination. But clearly, the current model of policing needs to change.

Political leaders, legislators, police board members, city councils and police chiefs in Canada and the United States have acknowledged as much, and with various degrees of specificity, have said that something must be done. What that might look like remains difficult to discern. Some have suggested the abolition of some police forces altogether; that is a non-starter, and will only divert attention away from more effective ways of dealing with the issue. Defunding is a more complicated proposal; most police forces are already underfinanced, but a careful look at how public funding is being used would be a worthwhile undertaking. Some police practices likely need to be more strictly limited or forbidden, including chokeholds and carding, while new ones should be mandated. And police-training curricula should be reformed so that they’re about more than just firearm requalification and criminal-law updates; it must be disseminated repeatedly over the course of all levels of a police career, and must send the message that the coercive power of the state should always be the last resort.

Story continues below advertisement

But whatever the solution is, it will be important to understand that change will be profoundly difficult – indeed, far harder than any simple message being delivered – because of the closed-personnel nature of these police services.

Closed-personnel organizations are ones in which young men and women join as recruits, plan to stay for their entire careers and work toward promotion within that force (some entry at mid-level is possible, but is relatively rare). Such systems aren’t the exclusive domain of police forces; they can also be found in intelligence agencies, foreign services, the military and in many religions.

All organizations develop a culture that determines not so much what they do but rather how they carry out their work, and police services are no exception, with the culture pervading widely across this closed loop. But while police culture varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is a function of many factors, a crucial commonality is that officers spend the majority of their time dealing with a small part of the population that the rest of us would often rather not hear about. This gives rise to a we-versus-them mentality – one that’s amplified by the closed-personnel systems and their practical requirement that members strongly support one another, often against any outsiders. The pressures of this culture of conformity and mutual support also make it difficult to operate within the structure. Policing’s hierarchical, command-and-control approach to managing and standardizing behaviour – as is required by the considerable power held by individual police officers – should make it easier to discipline “bad apples.” Instead, police culture tends to counterbalance the ability of chiefs to act.

Over the course of my career, I’ve worked with police officers from many forces. Virtually all of them impressed me with their dedication, work ethic and belief that their role was central to peace, order and good government. But I remember that most only ever wanted to discuss their good qualities; areas where improvement might be possible were rarely ever raised. With some notable exceptions, usually at the chief level, they were professionally very conservative and resistant to any suggestions from outsiders such as myself, my colleagues, or cabinet ministers.

Without a shadow of a doubt, statements to press for change by political leaders, legislators and police chiefs are necessary, but they’re far from sufficient. Consider the challenges in dealing with sexual abuse among the Roman Catholic clergy despite the views of the Pope, or the Canadian Armed Forces’ sexual-harassment crisis despite the efforts of the Chief of the Defence Staff. Indeed, it is telling that front-line officers and their unions or associations are often missing from the list of those agitating for change.

To get officers on board, organizations that work with the police should, at minimum, transparently acknowledge their own complicity in policing’s problems. To suggest that police boards, city councils, responsible ministers, Crown counsel and criminal law courts knew nothing of these appalling practices is to suggest either gross negligence or incompetence, when neither view is warranted. This broader insensitivity to systemic racism is part and parcel of the issues in our police.

Systemic discrimination or racism anywhere is an assault on what most Canadians believe and what the Charter demands. Because of how police services are organized, however, transformation is going to be arduous and slow. Police chiefs working inside their organizations cannot do this alone: a considerable amount of political capital, structural untangling and society-wide patience is going to have to be expended if the long mission ahead has any hope of succeeding.

The other morning at sunrise, I looked out the window and saw a couple who live across the street pull a badminton net into the middle of our road. They then used a tape measure to mark out the boundaries of the court. The husband served to his wife, and the game was on – not just as an idle volley of the birdie, but a fierce competition for points.

“There’s no wind early in the morning,” they explained to me, when I went out to watch their game. As for the net, “$50 at Canadian Tire.” It helps that, with most people working from home and summer camps closed, there is scant traffic.

I like our Toronto neighbourhood during this COVID-19 pandemic. The sense of community has never been stronger. Another couple has taken to walking the sidewalks in strong strides with great purpose. They wear T-shirts, shorts and matching ball caps. They have a circuit; they pass our house several times in an hour before breakfast. My wife and I call them “the power couple.” For months, when gyms were closed, two young women rolled out their mats in our park and fired up a laptop to lead them on their workout routine.

The world is quiet right now. How quiet? We now have some idea: The equipment that researchers use to detect earthquakes can also rate less dramatic events, such as the “seismic noise” we humans make in our cities. In July, Thomas Lecocq, a seismologist at the Royal Observatory of Belgium, and 65 other researchers, including William Minarik from McGill University, co-authored a paper in Science magazine titled Global Quieting of High-Frequency Seismic Noise Due to COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown Measures.

As the world shut down to battle the virus, Dr. Lecocq’s group found the “length and quiescence of this period represents the longest and most coherent global seismic noise reduction in recorded history.” The University of Auckland, who helped in the study, calls this peaceful period the “anthropause.”

The anthropause is great news for kids who want to learn to ride a bike on our street. Cars are rare.

I often work in the backyard near our WiFi modem. Parents walk by with their offspring. Our dog barks when other dogs pass. Laughter trickles over the fence. It helps that the aroma of sugar, milk and toffee wafts from the chocolate factory across the way. An invasive renovation of a house nearby, leaf blowers and transport trucks filled with cocoa butter sometimes blemish the serenity.

The coronavirus has upended routines. Typically, during the summer, I would hop on my bike and fight traffic on my way to an office near Union Station – and not really think about my street until after work. Now, I am here all the time with everyone else. We get to know one another a little bit.

Micro-performances in front yards break up the quiet. A young couple moved into a house across the way, and the man dragged his table saw onto the front lawn. Every afternoon for weeks they toiled there, building the perfect front porch. The scent of cut pine filled the air.

Another day, as I worked inside, the power went off. My wife and I went out the front door. All the neighbours appeared on their porches and we exchanged the news – everyone had been inside on their devices. The power returned, and people disappeared.

In the evening, our neighbours shut their laptops and go outside. In a phenomenon repeated across Canada, almost every family on our block has acquired a puppy. There’s a stretch of lawn and trees in front of a police station down the street that we call “Police Park.” There, every night, locals assemble for an hours-long romp we call the Puppy Party – Mac, Ruby and Pepper, the youngsters, meet older dogs such as Coco and Flint and Oscar, the big floppy Newfoundland.

COVID-19 has taken the lives of thousands of victims across Canada. Front-line workers have died from the virus. Unemployment has skyrocketed. Parents juggle kids and jobs at home. (My wife and I got lucky, since our kids are older. Our son graduated high school in a virtual ceremony that, despite the students being apart, had its sweet moments, too.) For most, this pandemic has brought challenges. Still, it feels okay to celebrate the anthropause.

The coronavirus has separated parents from their co-workers and kids from their classmates. The generations now spend more time among one another. Dave McGinn noted in The Globe and Mail last month that this pandemic has had the effect of returning us to the summers of the 1980s, when kids played with the other kids in their neighbourhood. That’s nice.

One evening I took the dog to the park. Couples worked, at a reasonable physical distance, to erect a volleyball net and mark out the perimeter in flagging tape. Their kids played in a wooded thicket, blissfully free, for a few minutes, from the hawk-like parental eye. As the net rose, women began a friendly argument about whose team an Australian dad on our block would join. He is tall and sculpted like a model from GQ. He just laughed.

Bruce Grierson is an author and journalist living in Vancouver.

Have you noticed you’ve been perceiving time differently since the world turned upside down in March?

Many people report that the first month of lockdown felt like it lasted about a year. But then the clock started speeding up. And now it’s whirring like a propeller.

If that’s been your experience, too, the question is why.

The short answer: because time isn’t real. It’s a social and psychological construct, a “rubbery thing,” as the Stanford neuroscientist David Eagleman puts it.

There’s often a pretty significant disconnect between the substantial “truth” of time – as measured by atomic clocks – and how it feels. Time seems to race or drag according to what’s going on around us.

What transpired in the early months of the pandemic was unprecedented in our lifetimes. Everything was novel. And novelty, psychologists have found, stretches time. Things that surprise us seize our attention, and gobble neural energy as the memories are processed. And that makes the weird episodes in our lives, as we reflect on them later, seem to have lasted much longer than they actually did.

Our brains are lazy – er, efficient. When they encounter something familiar, they kind of stop taking notes. Been there, done that. “See yesterday,” the brain jots in the margin, thereby preserving space for the next bit of real news – i.e., something different.

Those crazy, anxious early days of COVID-19 – the alarming numbers out of Iran and Italy, the chaos of everyone’s plans suddenly collapsing – were intense. And intensity of feeling, it turns out, pumps even more molasses into the temporal gears. It may have felt like a Michael Bay movie while it was happening, but in the brain’s director’s cut, it’s more like a Merchant Ivory film, the whole thing unfolding at the speed of a lazy river.

No wonder life B.C. – before COVID-19 – seems like eons ago.

But around late April or early May there was that shift. We started getting used to the weirdness. The shock of working from home and tracking the infection spikes and banging a pot in the evening began to wear off. Routine took hold (at least for those of us lucky enough not to be on the health care front lines). There were fewer unusual events to snag our attention and slow time, so the days started zipping by again.

This is all a fairly new discovery, this elastic property of the sense of time.

In the 1930s, an American physiologist named Hudson Hoagland was attending to his wife as she lay sick in bed with the flu. He nipped away from her bedside for a few moments and then returned, whereupon she remarked: “Where have you been? You’ve been away for ages!” Something was distorting her sense of time. Dr. Hoagland suspected the fever. Could it be there was some kind of clock in the human central nervous system – a chemical pacemaker that can be nudged by outside factors, like, in this case, heat? (Subsequent studies support Dr. Hoagland’s hunch that time slows as our core body temperature rises. So if you thought that Bikram yoga class would never end, now you know why.)

Today it’s clear there’s not just one internal clock governing our judgment of time; multiple systems work in concert. Dr. Hoagland’s original sleuthing sent us down a rabbit hole that is vastly deeper and windier than anyone suspected.

What’s interesting is that, while much of the variation in how we judge time is situational, some of it is not. One constant appears to be our age. Per the cliché, time actually does fly as we get older, studies suggests. This has always made me a little bit envious of kids, in their unleaky little boats. They never seem to lose whole days, let alone accidentally start writing the wrong decade on a cheque. It has been wild, during the pandemic, to think of our nuclear family holed up under the same roof, riding out this historical event together but experiencing it – the pace of it – quite differently.

Science cannot fully explain the generational discrepancy, but a few things may be going on.

One is, again, that novelty factor. Kids are relative newcomers to this planet, so they are still routinely surprised by stuff, and their brains work hard to sort it out. And since each passing hour is a larger proportion of a child’s short life, it may feel longer and more significant. Plus, kids’ attention and memory circuits are still growing, so the transmission of information may actually be physically slower, drawing time out even more.

Another possible ingredient in the mix: digital media. Gen Z is not exactly waiting on the pier for the next instalment of Charles Dickens’s new novel to arrive by boat. They have lived their whole life, as the writer Venkatesh Rao put it, “inside a cage of time made up of 32 satellites orbiting Earth.” What the young want – TV shows, songs, commodities – is available any time, and always has been. So: Less time spent reminiscing plus less time spent anticipating means more time moored in the present. We might guess – from other research – that this too puts the brakes on time.

In the early going of the pandemic, my wife and I got a wee inkling of what it might feel like to be a kid. We were jacked in to their time signature. Too bad it was mostly because we were overloading our circuits being stressed out and rolling the dice on what to do and which experts to believe; the lazy river was full of crocodiles. But as the weeks passed, and normalcy set in, the gulf between the generations began to open again. Time sped up as we calmed down, while they continued on their unhurried course. The kids seemed chill, for the most part – although much more was going on inside their heads.

There is a new word in circulation, hatched not from the neuroscience labs but from the jittery zeitgeist. The word is “shadowtime.” As defined by its creators, it is “a feeling of living in two distinctly different temporal scales simultaneously.” It’s as if two clocks are ticking at once – real time and existential time.

To use it in a sentence: “Kane was intently working on his presentation that was due the next morning, but as he looked up and saw the moon it occurred to him that the moon had been rising and setting for 4.5 billion years, moving ever farther away. He felt shadowtime for the rest of the evening.”

The word was coined by the Bureau of Linguistical Reality, a California-based conceptual art project, so it’s definitely more felicity than science. But it does capture the real and uncomfortable disconnect of having to navigate life, in its humdrum detail, while an environmental sword of Damocles dangles overhead. There’s some evidence that younger people sense the anxious doomsday countdown more acutely. They have more skin in the game, after all; it’s their future.

But there’s nothing like approaching one’s own personal expiry date to inject each passing moment with meaning. Gerontologists have found that older people, so long as they aren’t suffering, tend to positively cherish time. “The elders view time like a member of a desert tribe views water,” Karl Pillemer, a gerontologist at Cornell University, told me. “They can’t believe we would ever squander such a precious resource.” To younger people they counsel: “Think small.” Pay attention. Take delight in the hummingbird suspended outside your window. Relish your enchiladas – and the person who just laid them on the table in front of you.

To the extent that it stretches time, paying attention becomes a kind of investment plan.

Maybe the last reliable one we have left.

Haram Lubnan. Poor Lebanon.

As if hosting more than a million refugees from the Syrian war next door, an economy in free fall and COVID-19 weren’t enough, now the catastrophic destruction of the port of Beirut has left more than 150 dead, more than 6,000 injured and some 300,000 people – 5 per cent of the population – homeless. What can end this tale of woe for a country whose capital once saw itself as the Paris of the Middle East?

Story continues below advertisement

Sadly, that image is long gone, destroyed by the 1975-1990 civil war, corruption and regional turmoil. The hapless government called for a state of emergency in the wake of the port blast, only to be confronted by demonstrators chanting the slogan that almost a decade ago sparked the Arab Spring: “Ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam.” Which, in essence, translates to: “The people want the overthrow of the regime.”

Although the government has now resigned, popular fury is set to increase. On Aug. 18, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon in the Hague will issue its verdict on the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri. Four members of Hezbollah – the Shia militia and political party backed by Iran and Syria – have been tried in absentia for the bombing of Mr. Hariri’s motorcade.

Whatever the Special Tribunal’s verdict, political tensions will rise. Hezbollah, classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, enjoys widespread Shia support. Its militia is more powerful than the Lebanese army and it has a powerful bloc in parliament.

Just as the presence of Palestinian guerrillas and their “state within a state” was a factor in Lebanon’s civil war, so Hezbollah’s “state above the state” will provoke still more calls – by Lebanese and outsiders alike – to end a system in which political and economic power is allocated not by merit, but by religious sect.

But is that what “the people,” with their banners calling for thawra (revolution), really want? Lebanon, carved out of the Middle East a century ago by the Sykes-Picot accord between Britain and France, is a mosaic of Christians, Muslims, Druze, and others (some 18 sects are officially recognized). In 1943, when France ended its League of Nations mandate, independent Lebanon’s political leaders declared an unwritten “National Pact” under which the president would be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament a Shia Muslim.

As the first prime minister Riad al-Solh put it, the aim was to “Lebanonize Lebanese Muslims and to Arabize Lebanon’s Christians.” The Christians were to distance themselves from the West and the Muslims were to abandon the idea of Lebanon as part of a larger Arab nation.

The original premise was that Christians and Muslims were more or less equal in number. But the most recent census in Lebanon was conducted in 1932, and it is clear that Christians now comprise just a third of Lebanon’s citizens.

Story continues below advertisement

But why adjust the system to reflect demographic reality if the result would be another bout of sectarian warfare? The Taif agreement that led to the end of 15 years of civil war only tinkered at the edges, giving Muslims parity with Christians in parliament and enhancing the power of the prime minister.

Lebanon’s demonstrators have long demanded an end to confessional power-sharing and an end to meddling by a host of foreign powers, from America and Israel to Syria and Iran. Their one success was that domestic and international revulsion at the murder of Mr. Hariri forced Syria to withdraw its troops in 2005, 29 years after they began “safeguarding” Lebanon.

Lebanon has always been a fragile construction. When I lived in Beirut in the 1970s, the city was indeed the cosmopolitan “Paris of the Middle East,” until the civil war, abetted by outside powers, fragmented it into heavily armed neighbourhoods in which the religion listed on one’s identification card could mean life or death.

Given the sophistication and entrepreneurial energy of the Lebanese, it is conceivable that ending the confessional system would turn fragility into strength. But I doubt it.

The real challenge is to enforce accountability. It is shameful that the warlords of the 1970s and 1980s have become not statesmen but mobs in charge of protection rackets (power cuts, for example, provide easy money for suppliers of diesel generators). It is shameful that selfish bankers and official reluctance to guarantee urgent economic and financial reform have stalled negotiations with the International Monetary Fund.

The Lebanese deserve better. In the wake of the disaster in Beirut, the open question of how they will achieve it has become more difficult than ever to answer.

Sarah Moritz is a Canadian writer based in Beirut.

I moved to Lebanon in March, 2019, to pursue my graduate degree, which means I have experienced the thawra (revolution), economic crisis, COVID-19 and now the explosion, which has torn apart my home of Beirut. Through this I have learned to understand the magnitude of the resilience of the people in Lebanon, and why it is an attribute that has rightfully served as a point of pride. There is a reason why Beirut’s favoured symbol is the Phoenix – something that dies and is reborn, rising in its beautiful splendour again, from its own ashes. This power is made much more astounding, though, when you realize the resilience is a result of a population living under a regime that seems to do everything it can not just to stymie progress, but to prevent comfortable basic existence. The care those in Lebanon have for one another is genuine, but it is also necessary for survival – because it is understood by many that it is better to support and help one another, than to rely on the government for anything.

I witnessed this during the revolution, which is still continuing and has now been fired up by the indescribable fury triggered by the explosion. People take care of one another in person and virtually, organizing and providing everything from medical aid, food and protective gear, to mental-health support. After the explosion, self-initiated mobilization from local businesses and civilian groups, such as Muwatin Lebnene and Rebuild Beirut, involves taking surveys regarding the needs of individuals and families, and providing support in the form of first aid units, relief funding, equipment for anyone who wants to help clean destroyed streets, homes and local businesses, and generally connecting affected individuals with those who can help. This is while the government has not only done nothing to help clean and rebuild or offer services to their people, but has in some cases refused to release the bodies of those who died in the explosion to their families until the fines held by the deceased, such as unpaid traffic tickets, have been paid.

When it comes to postexplosion realities beyond the governments astounding historical and current disregard for their own people, I could talk about the dire situation with regards to poverty prior to the explosion, and how the explosion has exacerbated these realities. I could talk about what the loss of the grain silos and damage to the port, coupled with a government-imposed dependence on imports, means for the rapid growth of food insecurity in the economically devastated country with its hyper-inflated currency. I could talk about the garbage crisis that has been continuing unaddressed for years, which the rubble from the destruction will increase, or about how the general lack of electricity will now only get worse with the destruction of the country’s primary electricity provider. But they are related to an overarching and grave reality. Whether the ammonium nitrate was set off on purpose or not, or by whom, is also not the focus here – it is the fact that not only did the political elite know about the massive quantities being stored, they did nothing to remove it, and have refused to take any responsibility for what happened. All of this can be boiled down to the severity of the corruption, and serves as a reflection of the astounding arrogance that has developed as a result of what the elite clearly see as their invincibility.

This is why I believe a postexplosion Lebanon must include very significant international engagement with the country’s corrupt government and banking systems. Without addressing what has gotten the country to the horrific place it now finds itself in, and without meaningful international help to disassemble the cascading, iron grip of the elite, a future that the people of this country deserves will not be possible. The newly appointed “technocratic” government and its new Prime Minister, Hassan Diab, resigned, but the long-term political heads who have been responsible for, and profiting from, the people’s degrading situation for decades still predictably refuse to budge. Governments everywhere must refuse to engage with the political elite (including bankers) domestically and abroad. They have to insist on the resignation of every Lebanese ambassador and other political representatives in their respective countries. The offshore accounts of the political elite must be frozen immediately. Their assets, such as their luxurious homes, need to be seized, and an independent investigation into the explosion at the port (or, as it is also called, the “Cave of Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves”) needs to be held.

The explosion is not just catastrophic, it was avoidable, and a terrifyingly accurate embodiment of how entrenched corruption is within the government and its clientelist networks that run (or run into the ground) every part of the country. This is not a case of “Middle Eastern exceptionalism” but is a result of a colonial-created system that has been enthusiastically carried by political elite, some of whom are warlords or war entrepreneurs. And the power structure has been left unchecked for decades, not because consociational sectarian systems successfully result in fair and effective long-term governance (studies and history show they don’t), but, perhaps, because the level of human suffering in Lebanon caused by it has not been enough to warrant pressure to change (a system, according to the 1989 Taif Agreement, that was supposed to be temporary).

It took one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions in history for the suffering of the people of Lebanon to get international attention, and, while the people in Lebanon are resilient, they have been making it clear since Aug. 4 that they are beyond exhausted of having to be. Since the explosion, the people have been manually cleaning up the city their own government destroyed, they have been rallying to feed those who need it and they are working to find shelter for the 300,000 who have been left homeless – by themselves. So just imagine what this country would be capable of if the people had a government that did not hold their feet down on the backs of their necks and force them to breathe under water.

It is my possibly idealistic hope that this catastrophic event will finally push the international community to force the elite from their seats and seek justice in courts that will punish them for the true criminals they are. And, as I write this, we wait for the parliamentary meeting on declaring a state of emergency, which, if it happens, will mean further oppression of anyone who speaks out against the corrupt regime. International interference that acts in the best long-term interest of the people is what is necessary to create the opportunity for a positive future the people of Lebanon deserve, and one, 2enshallah, the current generations will be alive to see.

World Health Organization officials on Wednesday warned that Lebanon's COVID-19 response plan has become more difficult to implement in the aftermath of the massive blast that rocked the capital Beirut. Reuters

Dammed if you do

Re Site C Dam Underscores Need For More Time-sensitive Approach To Project Approvals (Aug. 13): Finally, someone has detailed a prime cause of Canada’s failure to develop meaningful infrastructure projects and enhance job opportunities in many areas of the country. Bill C-69 has been repeatedly mentioned as an enemy of development, particularly in the West.

I find it ironic that this legislation has not been changed, even though the Liberal government was willing to assist an engineering firm that does a great deal of work in this area of the economy – one headquartered in Quebec. This seems to be a flagrant example of bias against provinces that are more dependent on natural resource development.

Spending taxpayer dollars for businesses affected by the pandemic does not offset actively denying jobs that can give people feelings of self-worth. The cost to Canada will likely be immeasurable.

Re Turning Hotels Into Shelters: Proponents Say Idea Gives Homeless People Dignity And A Chance To Get Lives Under Control (Aug. 10): COVID-19 has exposed the gulf between those fortunate enough to have the space to practise physical distancing and those who experience homelessness. This is why the hotel program run by the House of Friendship in Kitchener, Ont., is so important, and similar programs in Toronto have provided a much-needed lifeline.

When coupled with onsite care from registered nurses and nurse practitioners, the unique needs of homeless people can be met, whether they need mental health and addiction services, treatment for chronic conditions such as diabetes, proper foot care or help with other ailments.

Nurses agree with the House of Friendship’s Jessica Bondy that more funding – from all three levels of government – is urgently needed so this model can continue. We should also fast-track supportive and accessible housing to build permanent solutions.

Only then can we ameliorate the suffering of persons experiencing homelessness, by providing them with the dignity of beds, pillows and safe places to sleep.

Re Optometrists Turning Patients Away In Fee Protest (Aug. 12): To the public, it looks like the Ontario Association Of Optometrists have a vision problem with their job action to send patients to emergency rooms. Only those with an impaired vision of society wouldn’t be able to see that taking serious time away from ERs during a pandemic mostly makes their profession look bad.

Although they are seeking better funding for eye care, they seem more to be exploiting a public crisis for personal gain. The OAO should get a new eye chart that forces them to look beyond their myopic self-interest.

Tony D’Andrea Toronto

As an optometrist in Ontario, I’d like to present clarification on our fight for long-term access to patient care.

Our cause is about funding and investment in an essential health care service. It’s been 30 years of almost no increases in funding, plus a pandemic that is limiting our ability to see patients and wiping out our revenues. We’re desperate and are doing our best to protect our patients and ourselves in a dire situation.

Overhead costs for service delivery (that is, staff, rent, leases, utilities, insurance, medical equipment) are approximately $90, while OHIP reimbursement is less than half that for urgent eye care services, which are paid $25 or less. This is unsustainable.

Story continues below advertisement

Our profession has no options for conflict resolution, such as arbitration. Since 1990, we find that the Ontario government has not paid a fair share of service overhead in this sector.

We can’t change the past, but we can protect eye care for the future. This government should do better than its predecessors and collaborate with Ontario’s doctors of optometry for a sustainable eye-care funding model that will help save eye care in the province.

Out of line

Re Amid Turmoil, Human-rights Museum Appoints New Head (Aug. 11): As the Canadian Museum of Human Rights brings the treatment of its workers into line with its own social mission, and as an institution in the service of society, it should also consider the rights of museum visitors.

Contemporary museum architecture and exhibition design often force visitors into a linear exhibition experience – sometimes referred to as the tyranny of the curatorial storyline. The design of the CMHR encourages this, rather than empowering visitors with, say, serendipitous choice or conscious self-selection of topics and subjects.

For schoolchildren, content selection should align with various sensitivities such as age, class curriculum, cultural backgrounds and learning styles. Such choices would be best made by professional educators rather than curators or tour guides.

Re Brent Carver Fervently Portrayed Society’s Anguished Outsiders (Aug. 7): I cast Brent in a film about Leonardo da Vinci’s invention of a flying machine to allow humans to soar into the air. Brent himself echoed the range of da Vinci’s talents, yet was so modest and understated.

Re Dubas On The Hot Seat After Early Playoff Exit (Sports, Aug. 13): Two weeks ago, I had never heard of Columbus goalie Joonas Korpisalo. Since then, he shut out the Leafs twice and broke a three-decade-old record with 85 saves in an NHL playoff game.

Leafs naysayers have already weighed in: Fire general manager Kyle Dubas, fire coach Sheldon Keefe, trade everyone not named Auston Matthews and start over again. Here’s the thing: Hot goaltending in hockey is like hot pitching in baseball. It is what it is.

The Leafs should tip their hats, but shouldn’t make long-term decisions based on individual hot streaks from the opposition. They should lick their wounds, make some tweaks and stay the course. There may be a time to blow things up, but now should not be that time.

Re Throw A Softball (Moment in Time, Aug. 10): I have enjoyed playing softball for more than 50 years, but as a third baseman, I still fail to see why it is called “softball.”

I’ve lost track of the times a misplayed line drive or hot grounder has cost me injuries from bone bruises, cuts and once a blow-out fracture to an eye.

There is nothing soft about a ball travelling at high speed that comes into contact with skin and bone.

At the very least, the arrest this week of Jimmy Lai, the outspoken owner of a popular pro-democracy tabloid in Hong Kong, has rallied the territory’s residents against Beijing’s first major attempt to assert its new authority over the former British colony.

It it also a reminder that Beijing’s desire to absorb Hong Kong into the corrupt justice system that keeps Chinese citizens silent on the mainland has not yet been fulfilled, and that there is still time to try to preserve the freedoms that China vowed would continue when it took over the territory in 1997.

Mr. Lai is now out on bail, along with his two sons and four executives from his media company, who were also arrested and charged. He isn’t stashed away in a Chinese jail, the way an accused dissident or alleged threat to national security on the mainland would be.

Instead, the 72-year-old media mogul is using his freedom to speak out against the actions of Beijing and its supporters in the Hong Kong government. His Twitter feed was filled this week with sharp satire and links to Apple Daily pieces critical of China. He is still giving interviews to foreign journalists, and he went ahead with a weekly live online chat in which he discussed his arrest.

“The show must go on!” he tweeted.

Most importantly of all, his newspaper, Apple Daily, is still publishing, even though 200 Hong Kong police officers carried out a garish, nine-hour raid on its newsroom the day he was arrested.

Officers paraded Mr. Lai in handcuffs past his employees, and seized a large number of documents, on grounds that Mr. Lai had violated the controversial new security law that China imposed on Hong Kong as of July 1. The law criminalizes talk of independence and outlaws criticism of the Chinese Communist Party, casting such acts as sedition, terrorism and colluding with a foreign power.

The arrest of a high-profile media mogul and the raid on the Apple Daily newsroom were obvious intimidation and harassment tactics, designed to dampen support for independence in Hong Kong, and silence criticism of Mr. Xi’s regime.

It didn’t work. Hong Kongers lined up to buy the next day’s issue of Apple Daily, which was filled with accounts of the arrests. The tabloid sold 500,000 copies, five times the normal press run. As well, more than 20,000 Hong Kongers bought digital subscriptions in the days after the raid.

Story continues below advertisement

Not only that, the newspaper’s supporters answered social media calls to buy stock in Mr. Lai’s media company, Next Digital. The stock price jumped 1,200 per cent in the two days after the arrests, thanks in part to retail investors who purchased just one or two shares in solidarity. (The share price has since fallen, but it remains up overall on Thursday.)

And Mr. Lai, though scared, is still speaking his mind. Beijing’s attempt to intimidate him has backfired.

There is no doubt Mr. Xi’s henchmen will try again. Beijing has already forced Hong Kong to postpone coming local elections for a year, because pro-democracy candidates were likely to win and might have taken control of the Legislative Council. Beijing has also banned four duly elected pro-democracy LegCo members in a naked attempt to keep its side in control.

The arrest of Mr. Lai and others puts the lie to the claim by Hong Kong’s government that the new security law would only be used to crack down on pro-democracy rioting going forward, and would not be invoked to retroactively go after critics or silence the press.

Above all, China has effectively voided the “one country, two systems” international treaty it signed before it took over Hong Kong in 1997. If the new security law proves unable to intimidate Hong Kongers, no doubt Beijing will do an end run around the territory’s relatively independent justice system, with its bail laws and other inconveniences, and simply start disappearing people like Mr. Lai into mainland jails.

That’s why the world, Canada included, needs to support Mr. Lai and keep the pressure on Beijing. As Mr. Lai said in a recent op-ed in The New York Times, the longer Hong Kong can hold out, the more the world will see “how distrust-worthy China is, how dangerous it is to peace in the world.”

Abraham Lowenthal is the president emeritus of the Pacific Council on International Policy. Nelson W. Cunningham is the former special advisor under president Bill Clinton.

As multilateral institutions attempt to respond to today’s unprecedented global challenges, one that already works well is the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).

Established in 1959 and headquartered in Washington, the IDB is widely recognized for its important role in supporting efforts to reduce Latin American poverty and inequality in a sustainable way and to facilitate inter-American economic co-operation. It is the largest source of development financing to our hemisphere, channelling some US$12-billion a year in loans to Latin American and Caribbean countries to support well-reviewed projects in infrastructure, state modernization, education and social programs. Annually, the IDB finances more projects in Latin America than any other multilateral development bank, including the World Bank. The Bank’s significance, moreover, should be even greater in the future, as Latin America copes with the triple whammy of COVID-19 (with 28 per cent of the world’s fatalities so far), the steepest economic downturn of any developing region (projected by the International Monetary Fund to plunge by 9.4 per cent), and major social upheavals in many countries.

Story continues below advertisement

That is the context for the Trump administration’s unprecedented nomination this month of a White House aide, the first from the United States, to serve as the IDB’s fifth president. The choice risks alienating the region and politicizing this successful institution. Sixty years of tradition – of Latin American leadership of the IDB – should not be overturned in the bank’s presidential elections, currently scheduled for mid-September.

The surprise announcement has provoked a storm of negative reaction in Latin America. Five recent Latin American presidents – Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, Ricardo Lagos of Chile, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Julio Sanguinetti of Uruguay, all outstanding statesmen and warm friends of the United States – issued a strong statement in opposition.

The Trump administration, for its part, is pressing Latin American governments to support the nomination, dangling the carrot of the Bank’s upcoming capital renewal and brandishing the stick of withholding postpandemic relief.

Yet, opposition is building. In recent days, Chile, Mexico, Costa Rica and Argentina have called for a delay of the election to 2021. The European Union is lobbying its member countries who are IDB shareholders to join them. And Canada, which controls just over 4 per cent of the vote, is weighing its decision. The tipping point to block the needed quorum – more than 25 per cent of voting shares abstaining – is within reach.

This is not about Mr. Trump’s nominee, who brings relevant background in economic, financial and foreign affairs. The main objection to his nomination is that it disregards a decades-old practice started under president Dwight Eisenhower’s auspices, which provides that the Bank would be headquartered in Washington, its president would be Latin American and its executive vice-president would be a U.S. citizen. This formula has worked well for six decades, years in which Latin American countries have increased their capital contribution and sense of ownership, and have made the Bank’s loans and programs ever more effective.

The U.S. is the largest single contributor to and shareholder in the IDB, but Eisenhower’s decision to agree to Latin American leadership of the Bank is consistent with the traditional postwar U.S. approach to multilateral organizations that he championed – influence, yes, but one-country dominance, no.

If the Trump administration’s unprecedented effort to place an American in the IDB presidency is intended to counter growing Chinese influence in Latin America, hijacking a successful multilateral institution is the wrong approach. The right way to restrain Chinese clout would be to reinforce meaningful inter-American co-operation to meet economic and social needs. Moreover, naming an American as head of the IDB shortly before the November presidential election risks marginalizing and politicizing the institution.

The pandemic has delayed or made virtual many multilateral meetings. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, for example, postponed its annual meeting because of the pandemic. The IDB postponed its September annual meeting for six months for the same reason. It should also defer until March 2021 the vote to elect its new president. That is the prudent step.

And at that time, the U.S. government – whether led by Donald Trump or Joe Biden – should return to the well-established norm that the IDB’s president be a Latin American. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.

Ferrukh Faruqui is an Ottawa writer and community activist.

COVID-19 has redefined every facet of our lives, and the hajj – the mandatory, once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage for Muslims – is no exception. Typically, 2.5 million pilgrims converge on Mecca in Saudi Arabia every year to fulfill this fifth pillar of Islam. But the pandemic dictated that only 1,000 people who already live in the country would be allowed to perform this year’s five-day ritual, which ended Aug. 2.

For me, though, there was something else extraordinary about this year’s hajj. I was overcome by the sight of women circumambulating the coveted inner circles nearest to the Kaaba, the most sacred site in Islam, in the heart of Mecca’s Grand Mosque. In a YouTube interview with Mufti Menk, a popular Zimbabwean cleric, one of these fortunate pilgrims marvelled: “I thought it would be like when women pray behind the men … but here I was, in the first row closest to the Kaaba.”

Her strange but beautiful experience unfortunately belies the recent troubling phenomenon of hostility toward female pilgrims. Though we comprise half the world’s two billion Muslims, many women are still forced to chafe under gender restrictions. In the past, there would be solace in Mecca’s egalitarian rules, but now, even the holiest of holies is less welcoming – perhaps not even safe.

Last fall, my daughter Nishat flew to Mecca with her new husband for umrah, the lesser, year-round pilgrimage seeking reconnection with God. But on the night of her arrival, she called me, sobbing. Her pilgrimage had been “ruined” by officious strangers who tugged at her hijab and shouted at her. Something in me withered and died. I recalled my own 1988 umrah, when my scarf slipped intermittently off my head. Yet I wasn’t accosted by outraged, gimlet-eyed pilgrims; I was left in peace to contemplate God.

Disillusioned women shared similar stories with me. Hoping for a transformative journey, they were instead hectored and betrayed by fellow believers. Being reprimanded by strangers for dressing “improperly” was just the beginning; some detailed sexual harassment, even assault – violations that stain this sacred space.

Such gender-based discrimination has become a part of the Canadian Muslim experience, too. My father designed Winnipeg’s first mosque in the 1970s, and our family found a spiritual home in its bright, barrier-free prayer hall. When women stood at the pulpit to address the mixed congregation there, no one tried to silence them. We weren’t forced into segregated rooms through back entrances. But sadly, that halcyon era is history.

A battle over sacred spaces has played out in North American mosques since the 1980s, when the Saudi Arabian government launched an oil-funded campaign to homogenize Islam overseas. Strict Saudi interpretations of the faith drove the imported fundamentalism that gripped our communities. One day we arrived at our mosque to find a physical barrier separating the men in the front from the women in the back. The unmosquing of Muslim women had begun.

Ironically, the only place where men and women remained free to pray together was in the very heart of the Saudi kingdom. But soon the conservative sheiks whose support legitimizes the House of Saud wrested control of the Grand Mosque, too, by allowing freshly “radicalized” Muslim pilgrims to police each other.

Women of all ages now report strangers hissing imprecations on their pilgrimages, impatiently adjusting their hijabs or demanding that they cover their faces – which is forbidden during these rituals. As former New York Times correspondent Diaa Hadid chronicled during her hajj in 2016: “As I tried to find room between worshippers, a security guard shouted that I was taking space where men needed to walk … I felt safe. But also, too often, second-class.”

Some men even cynically commit assault under the cover of faith, grabbing buttocks or breasts. In a 2018 Facebook post, Pakistani Sabica Khan described the multiple assaults she endured near the Kaaba, a story amplified by Egyptian-American journalist Mona Eltahawy, who then launched #MosqueMeToo by sharing the story of her own assault in Mecca at the age of 15. The campaign unleashed emotional accounts from women who’d suffered similar molestation. Even in Mecca, the real world intrudes to shame women and put them in their place. As Ms. Eltahawy wrote: “The men who assaulted me abused the sanctity of a sacred space to ensure the silence of their victim.”

At its core, Islam is a feminist religion. Georgetown University historian Margot Badran tirelessly celebrates the forgotten tenets of Islamic feminism, declaring that in the Koran, “men and women alike are enjoined to obey Islamic precepts and are exhorted to engage in taqwa or righteous behaviour.” And in her revolutionary book Believing Women in Islam, scholar Asma Barlas shows how centuries of patriarchal readings of Muslim scripture have sown misogyny.

Let’s cleanse our hearts and remember the Koran’s forgotten message of radical equality. Maybe then we can halt the exodus of women from the sacred spaces that belong to us all, so that images of women touching the Kaaba become the new normal.

The U.S.-China dispute just took a dangerous turn. Late last week, the U.S. government issued three separate measures – two executive orders imposing sanctions on social-media networks WeChat and TikTok, and another to set up a “clean network” program – that, come mid-September, would prohibit any U.S. citizen or company from conducting business with those apps’ Chinese parent companies, Tencent and ByteDance respectively.

While these efforts take aim at legitimate security concerns, the hawkish measures were surely intended, at least in part, to strengthen President Donald Trump’s chances of winning re-election in November. Given the bipartisan support for national-security pressure on China, the orders may well prove helpful in that regard.

Story continues below advertisement

But the three measures’ wider effects are far more consequential, including for Canada. If fully implemented, they could eviscerate the foundations of a free and open internet, strengthen authoritarian governments and hasten the unravelling of the economic interdependencies that powered the most successful half-century in human history. And while it will be virtually impossible to enforce these orders, which are already facing legal challenges, the damage is already being done. Indeed, by signing these orders, the U.S. government has effectively ended its long-standing role as guarantor of a free, interoperable and neutral global internet.

Mr. Trump’s political pyrotechnics – part of a years-long strategic campaign against Beijing that includes tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese products, restrictions on Chinese technologies, and sanctions against Hong Kong and Beijing officials – may not even achieve their intended ends. Paradoxically, this latest crackdown threatens to actually hurt U.S. corporations and speed up deglobalization. After all, China makes up roughly 19 per cent of global GDP in a deeply interconnected global economy, so e-commerce companies such as Amazon will need to rethink how to source the hardware and software that power their global cloud infrastructures, while companies that partner with ByteDance and Tencent could experience devaluation and retaliation. Tencent is one of the world’s largest tech firms, with stakes in video-game studios, social-media apps and music companies around the world. U.S. companies, including Visa, Mastercard and Starbucks, also use WeChat’s e-commerce functions in China, and they may be forced to reconsider their footprint there.

The executive orders might also normalize governmental control over the flow of information into and out of their jurisdictions. In recent years, autocratic governments in North Korea, Russia, India and Belarus, among others, have hived off their citizens’ access to the internet, and this “splinternet” will have dangerous implications for digital and human rights.

Further, Chinese President Xi Jinping stands to benefit from U.S. sabre-rattling. Regardless of whether ByteDance and Microsoft make a deal to acquire at least some part of TikTok before next month’s deadline (unless Twitter beats them to it), Mr. Xi will almost certainly feel empowered to take reciprocal actions, including stepping up interference efforts in the coming U.S. elections (as some believe is already occurring). As the second-largest holder of U.S. debt, China could also dump bonds, increasing interest rates for the battered U.S. economy. This might negatively affect China’s trade balance in the short-term, but could also hurt Mr. Trump’s prospects for re-election.

Perhaps most worryingly, Mr. Trump’s orders undermine the role of the United States as the lead defender of digital freedoms, open innovation and the wider digital economy. The contest over the future of the internet will not just be between the U.S. and China; other countries will likely join the chorus to overhaul the internet. China is unlikely to sit idly by and could work with allies to enact similar restrictions on foreign operators. And the potential ascendance of this techno-nationalism will devastate political, social and economic relations just about everywhere.

Canada can help combat this trend by defending an internet that benefits everyone. This is not just a political imperative; it is an economic priority. Today, we rank as one of the most digitally advanced countries in the world, and yet Canada’s IT sector is still dependent on technologies and cloud resources whose origins and operators lie beyond its borders. Mr. Trump’s latest gambit exposes the vulnerability of Canadians to tariffs on data transit across Chinese-owned fibre-optic cables, and to sanctions that could cut off access to critical cloud providers. Such scenarios seem far-fetched, but that was once the view of U.S. sanctions on Canadian exports under national security auspices, too. And Canada’s Nortel, once a global leader in telecommunications, collapsed in part because of Chinese cyberespionage.

The next chapter of the internet will be written in 2020. As the U.S. and China battle over internet supremacy, middle powers risk being roadkill along the information superhighway. For better or worse, the internet has propelled unparalleled advancements in science, education, political expression and economic prosperity – values that Canada has embraced. If the world truly needs more Canada, then standing up for a free and open internet is not just in Canada’s interest, but the world’s.

Michael Bryant is the executive director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and a former attorney-general of Ontario. The CCLA is a co-claimant in Kim Taylor’s legal challenge of Newfoundland and Labrador’s COVID-19 travel ban.

There is a monumental Canadian issue currently before our courts at the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador, situated a stone’s throw from the coastline of St. John’s Harbour on the very edge of Confederation. It’s an issue that’s always hiding in plain sight amid important national conversations about racism, reconciliation, and COVID-19. It’s about the space between that courthouse and the westernmost edge of Victoria and Haida Gwaii, running north to Iqaluit.

Regionalism has always been what Canada was about, according to many historians, for most of our history. The taking of First Nations, Metis and Inuit lands was overshadowed throughout most of our legal history when, as a bulwark against the balkanization of those regions, Indigenous lands were misappropriated into a union of the British North American colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the Province of Canada (what is now Ontario and Québec). Later, Confederation would encompass territories west and north, and – inspired by the spirit of a Mari usque ad Mare – its sea-to-sea ambitions were completed when Newfoundland and Labrador joined in 1949.

So it was that the Constitution Act, 1867, guaranteed mobility “as if provincial boundaries did not exist,” according to the Supreme Court of Canada’s interpretation. That’s because we were a single nation, a confederation, not a socioeconomic union of sovereigns or colonies, nor a transnational union of member states like the European Union. Canada was one state, with an international border, over which sovereignty was exercised.

But then, during the COVID-19 crisis, 153 years later, provinces and territories began to behave as if these subnational jurisdictions were sovereign themselves – effectively erasing Confederation not with a bang, but with the whimper of a seemingly sensible public health order containing a travel ban against non-residents of suddenly sovereign provinces. And as a result, you and I are not allowed to travel to various provinces, including the famously hospitable Rock, simply because we lack the requisite address or emergency-management credentials to make our mobility “essential.” Since the start of the pandemic, travel bans have launched border patrols in Quebec, the territories, and several Atlantic provinces.

To be sure, advising me against Toronto-to-St. John’s travel is one thing. But legally barring my entry is another. When powerful regional feelings are ignited by laws dividing us from “them,” Canada is balkanized for the worse. We’re no longer raising each other up. Our rights are no longer universal, but dependent on where we come from. That becomes even more troubling when one views those travel bans through the lens of reconciliation.

If nothing else, it’s certainly counter to the popular narrative. The popular musical Come From Away tells the story of how the town of Gander, Nfld., welcomed, with profound kindness, a group of people whose flights were rerouted there after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. That’s a true story; Operation Yellow Ribbon sent 38 planes’ worth of travellers for Gander to band around, despite the global anxiety and fear in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. But little of that munificence has been on display during this latest crisis. Interprovincial/territorial co-ordination is nowhere to be seen.

If “Stay Away” is to be the pandemic sequel to “Come From Away,” it will come at the cost of constitutional guarantees to mobility rights for all Canadians and permanent residents. That’s why we argue that politicians who are seeking to establish a fearful order out of chaos with travel bans are merely bootstrapping dubious public-order efforts onto public health pronouncements. It damages the rule of law, threatens our Constitution, and ignores the very purpose of our mobility rights – that is, to do more together than we can apart. This also foments fear of COVID-19, which can then devolve into fear of outsiders – who may reciprocate, deepening divisions.

But such leaders are getting their marching orders from their anxious electorates – which means you can make a huge difference. One person at a time, we can resist the forces of fear and anxiety through our own individual behaviour. This is not to say that one should be obnoxious about the health concerns of others; escalating the tension doesn’t help. But it wouldn’t hurt to safely engage in a little Canadian hospitality, and urge your local and provincial/territorial government to do something for, not against, another Canadian region. That kind of reciprocity was the original rationale for Canada’s confederation of outsiders, and it’s a needed tonic for the cruel new logic of COVID-19 regionalism.

Cause and effect?

Re Coming To A Head (Letters, Aug. 12): A letter-writer relates his positive view of Julie Payette, after attending an awards ceremony at Rideau Hall for his cousin. Let’s put this into context.

Ms. Payette had a history of not showing up at such ceremonies, including at my wife’s being awarded the Governor-General’s medal for volunteering. Instead, other local dignitaries, such as the mayor of Ottawa, stepped in to do her duties. I believe the ceremony attended by the letter-writer only happened because of her previous dereliction of duty, as she tried to make amends by putting on a good show.

Bruce Hutchison Ottawa

I suspect that Julie Payette’s personality is not ideally suited to the role envisioned by traditionalists, but perhaps it’s appreciated by many average Canadians. I, for one, think having an accomplished woman from outside the circle of diplomacy was a very cool idea and one that civil servants assigned to the Governor-General’s staff may need to accommodate.

School crunch

Re Class-size Plan Puts Students At Risk: Toronto Public Health (Aug. 8): Toronto Public Health and other public-health units are on the mark that maintaining current elementary class sizes would be a risk for the spread of COVID-19.

Story continues below advertisement

Studies are still inconclusive regarding children and COVID-19. Outbreaks have occurred involving young children in elementary schools in Jaffa, Israel and Trois-Rivières, Que. Outbreaks at two child-care centres in Toronto and Montreal led to temporary closings in late spring. That is why the government and school boards should take the precautionary principle and only reopen schools with smaller classes.

The Ontario government should rethink its return-to-school plan and put the necessary funding in place to ensure the safety and health of students, educators and staff. It should also include improved building ventilation to comply with recommended standards, additional classroom space if needed and the hiring of more educators.

Doug Ford has said he “won’t spare a penny” to keep kids safe. He should put his sentiment into action.

Sam Hammond President, Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario; Toronto

Re How Your Kids Can Safely Go Back To School (Editorial, Aug. 12): As an Ontario educator of 30-plus years, I could analyze whether we ought to continue to pause provincial language assessments in addition to math testing to save approximately $20-million. Or, using available global data, I could discern that smaller class sizes come September is a necessity. Instead, though, I would like to talk about soap – and while we’re at it, warm running water and hand dryers, too.

Supplies such as soap are supposed to be furnished by school boards, but it needs to be managed by custodial staff, who have been cut to the point that soap may never reach the precious hands that need to be washed. If I had a dollar for every millilitre of soap I purchased for students in four schools over 20 years, I would be independently wealthy, spending my days counting swallowtail butterflies at the cottage.

Simply put, a safe September requires supplies: soap in every school washroom, all day long. Is it a 21st-century innovation? Nope. Groundbreaking? Hardly. But everyone deserves a safe start to the school year.

June Starkey OCT, PhD; Toronto

It is clear that opening our schools will be essential to any return to normalcy in Canada, and The Globe’s editorial finds credible evidence to suggest it can be done safely. I suppose the big question is: Will it be done safely?

In Ontario, we are set to have kindergarten classes with up to 29 students who would not wear masks. Physical distancing would be next to impossible. It’s clear to me that returning students in this manner is more of an experiment than a controlled action.

We should cross our fingers that the experiment works, but I can’t help but believe we will be relying more on luck than science.

I asked a friend and her 15-year-old son how they felt about going back to school in September. She was all for sending him back.

His response? “I’ll go if my friends are going and not go if they’re not. And if there’s no lunch, what’s the point?”

I submit this in case it was thought that people were making back-to-school decisions based on science and expert public-health advice!

Ring the alarm

Re How Can Canada’s Performing Arts Ecosystem Change Amid COVID-19? (Arts & Pursuits, Aug. 8): Christopher Deacon, who holds a secure position at one of Canada’s most prestigious and well-funded institutions, has had decades to lift up more diverse artists as he climbed and to affect change within the National Arts Centre. That he has been oblivious to the lack of opportunities for marginalized artists, and that the light is only dawning now, reveals that he may not be the right person for the job he currently holds.

I would like to see The Globe and Mail give voice to an artist directly affected by the current arts crisis and the systemic racism within arts organizations.

Story continues below advertisement

Anne Driscoll St. Albert, Ont.

Christopher Deacon states that “Canada is awakening to long-ignored realities – the systemic racism of our institutions.” But it seems he is the one “awakening,” and my response is: What took so long?

Canada’s arts community needs concrete plans for systematic change, not generalizations and platitudes. As head of one of the most powerfully funded venues in Canada, where is the inspired leadership?

Many Canadian arts organizations have been addressing issues of racism and social injustice for years. Mr. Deacon and the National Arts Centre could learn from those already walking the walk. With all of his power and resources, Mr. Deacon should step up with action and commitment.

Lucas Jackson/Reuters

A lawyer for some of the Sandy Hook school shooting victims’ families accused Remington Arms on Tuesday of using its new bankruptcy case to try to wipe out their lawsuit over how the company marketed the rifle used in the massacre.

An attorney for Remington denied the allegation during a phone conference call presided over by a federal bankruptcy court judge in Decatur, Alabama.

Also Tuesday, the judge, Clifton Jessup Jr., denied the families’ request to create a committee – comprised of people who are suing Remington over the use of its products – that would have a say in the bankruptcy proceedings. The judge, however, allowed one lawsuit plaintiff – not the Sandy Hook families – to sit on the main committee of unsecured creditors.

Story continues below advertisement

David Elsberg, a lawyer for the families, said Remington is trying to rush an auction of its holdings, leave the families out of the process and has not included their lawsuit or other lawsuits over its products in the new bankruptcy case it filed late last month. He said the bankruptcy case is so new that many people who may have claims against the company may not even know about the case.

“The families have grave concerns about the speed, the breakneck speed, that the debtors (Remington) are setting up for the sale,” Elsberg said. “There won’t be, there simply can’t be, a full and fair process unless this high-speed train that we’re on slows down.”

Despite the bankruptcy case being filed only last month, Remington – the nation’s oldest gun maker, based in Madison, North Carolina – already is planning to sell off its holdings in a Sept. 17 auction. The company has a plant in Huntsville, Alabama.

It’s the company’s second bankruptcy filing in two years. Remington, weighed down by lawsuits and retail sales restrictions following the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012, listed assets and liabilities of between $100 million and $500 million, and between 1,000 and 5,000 creditors, in its new case.

A gunman using a Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle made by Remington killed 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on Dec. 14, 2012.

A survivor and relatives of nine victims of the shooting are suing Remington in Connecticut Superior Court, saying the company should have never sold such a dangerous weapon to the public and alleging it targeted younger, at-risk males in marketing and product placement in violent video games. The lawsuit has been put on hold because of the bankruptcy case. Remington denies the lawsuit’s allegations and says it is immune from being sued under federal law.

Jessup on Tuesday approved a schedule for the Sept. 17 auction that allows the Sandy Hook families and others to object to the sale by Sept. 1. He dismissed the families’ objection to the schedule.

Story continues below advertisement

Nancy Mitchell, a lawyer for Remington, told the judge that Elsberg’s comments about the company trying to rush the process and exclude the families were not true.

A lawyer for the United Mine Workers of America union also expressed concerns Tuesday about retired Remington workers losing their benefits because of the bankruptcy. Jessup allowed a union representative to sit on the unsecured creditors committee, but as an ex-officio member with a voice but no vote.

The judge also gave a spot on the committee to the parents of a Montana teenager who died in 2015 from a gunshot wound from a Remington rifle – giving lawsuit plaintiffs a voice and vote. Sharon and Randall Teague are suing the company, saying their son was carrying the hunting rifle at their Seeley Lake home when it fired accidentally because of a defective design and killed him.

Remington, in court papers, has denied the Teagues’ allegations and questioned whether their son’s death was a suicide.

Scientifically sound, the inflation rate doesn’t square with the lives a lot of us live. Inflation has been a virtual non-issue for decades, but we all have significant, high-visibility costs in our lives that have risen a lot. Home insurance and postsecondary education are two examples.

Get ready for more. The official inflation rate in June was 0.7 per cent, but costs here and there are starting to creep higher. One of the ways this is happening is through what are being referred to as “COVID fees” – extra amounts tacked onto your bill for goods and services to cover costs related to the pandemic.

Story continues below advertisement

A restaurant my wife and recently visited in Ottawa says on its menu that a $5-per-guest fee will be added to bills to help cover extra costs from meeting COVID-19 regulations. According to news reports, dental offices and hair and nail salons have been adding similar fees in amounts between $7 and $18 to cover the cost of masks, gowns and other equipment.

Businesses are as much a victim of the pandemic as households. But if the pandemic hit you hard in a financial way, it can seem insensitive or worse when a business asks you for extra money.

A lot of people can afford it, though. Just look at the latest statistics on consumer spending.

TD Economics reported Monday that personal spending increased 5.4 per cent on a year-over-year basis for the first week of August. Remove spending categories that face restrictions because of physical distancing (travel and entertainment, for example), and you have spending growth of 18 per cent. Spending growth was described as healthy in all provinces, notably in Toronto, thanks to the lifting of economic restrictions.

RBC Economics has already said that people spent 3 per cent more in July, the first year-over-year increase since the pandemic began. “While spending in many categories was flat in July, spending on self-care and dining improved,” RBC said.

Like individuals, businesses have received government financial support during the pandemic. But between extra costs incurred to stay open and the burden of physical distancing, some businesses are struggling to survive.

A parliamentary committee was told last week that many businesses in the hospitality industry have lost between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of their revenue as a result of the pandemic. Roughly one out of seven small and medium-sized businesses said they were at least thinking about closing or declaring bankruptcy at the end of June, according to a survey by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.

At the end of March – let’s hope that was the pandemic’s nadir – I published a list of 27 ways for the financially fortunate to help out in my free e-mail newsletter, Carrick on Money. One reader said it was “the most important article you’ve ever written,” and many others were supportive as well.

COVID fees are another way the financially fortunate can help out. The outdoor patio of that restaurant with the $5-a-person COVID fee was really pleasant. Paying an extra $10 to help ensure this kind of socializing remains on the table, so to speak, seemed fair.

Paying an additional fee to dentists may seem a bit much, but consider that dental practices also employ hygienists, receptionists and others. The COVID fee you pay to have your teeth cleaned helps keep these people safe and employed.

What businesses owe their customers is clear, prominent disclosure of their COVID fees. Customers should see the fee when they walk into a store or restaurant, and have it clearly listed in their bill.

Also, COVID fees have to end at some point. A backlash is coming if they turn into a new version of the fuel surcharges that transportation companies introduced when energy prices were high and then left in place when oil prices fell.

If you can’t afford to pay a COVID fee, say so. There’s no shame in having lost a job or income in a pandemic. But if you’re in the majority who can pay, then accept the fee with grace. Consider it a way for the financially fortunate to support the businesses we rely on and enjoy.

Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

Allan Lanthier is a retired partner of an international accounting firm and has been an adviser to both the Department of Finance and Canada Revenue Agency.

The federal government has introduced sweeping changes to the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. CEWS has been extended to December, 2020, and the requirement that an employer suffer a revenue decline of at least 30 per cent has been repealed.

Starting in July, an employer that has any revenue decline at all is entitled to a subsidy, even if the decline is unrelated to COVID-19. The new rules will be a windfall for many large and profitable Canadian corporations.

Story continues below advertisement

When CEWS was introduced, retroactive to March, 2020, the government decided to subsidize the wages of both active employees and those who were laid off. The same rules applied to both categories: In general terms, if an employer’s revenue declined by at least 30 per cent in any four-week period, it received a 75-per-cent subsidy for all wages paid in that period. The argument was that, in the early stages of the pandemic, subsidies should apply for both furloughed individuals and, to minimize further layoffs, for active employees.

CEWS was extended in late July. The 75-per-cent subsidy rate has been replaced for active employees by lower rates starting in July. But there was little need to continue subsidizing businesses for active employees: The economy is recovering and many employers are saying they can’t find enough workers, not that they have too many and are considering a second wave of layoffs. And with any revenue decline now giving rise to the subsidy, tens of millions of dollars will be given to businesses that don’t need the cash.

One example is Rogers Communications Inc. Rogers has announced that, for its quarter ended June 30, 2020, it had a revenue decline of 17 per cent as compared with 2019. But we won’t be starting a GoFundMe page – Rogers had net income of $279-million for the quarter and paid $252-million of dividends. Nonetheless, the revenue decline should deliver handsome cash subsidies to the company.

For the month of July, 2020, Rogers will compare its revenue with July, 2019, (or with the average revenue for the months of January and February, 2020, if that gives a better result). Rogers has 25,000 active employees, and if it has a 17-per-cent revenue decline in July, it should receive a subsidy of about $25-million for that month.

Or consider Royal Bank of Canada. The bank has more than 70,000 active employees in Canada. For its quarter ended April 30, 2020, the bank reported a revenue decline of 10 per cent. If that decline persists into the month of July, the bank should receive a subsidy of about $40-million – this even though the bank earned $1.5-billion in its most recent quarter and paid dividends of the same amount.

Twenty-five million here, 40 million there, and pretty soon you’re talking about real money. There is no mischief on the part of these companies: Management has a fiduciary responsibility to the company’s stakeholders – shareholders, employees and customers – to claim any amounts that are legally due. It is government policy that is out of whack.

Some smaller businesses may retain a few active employees as a result of the new subsidy. However, the subsidy will not be relevant to employment decisions of large and profitable corporations, and the subsidy for active employees will therefore not protect existing employees to any significant extent.

Story continues below advertisement

There was a much simpler solution: The subsidy should have been eliminated for active employees, with an exception for small business. Small firms are always at greater risk of failing – and terminating employees as a result – than large corporations.

A number of other countries, including Britain, Denmark and Australia, have introduced wage subsidy programs. While the rules vary from country to country, there are few countries that subsidize the wages of active employees.

The new rules provide much needed support for individuals who are still out of work and that is appropriate. But with the economy on the mend, there was no reason to continue doling out cash for employees who are active and working productively in a business.

The government had many weeks to develop rules that provide wage support in a sensible and fiscally responsible way. It failed in that effort.

The federal fiscal snapshot in July projects a pandemic-induced deficit of $343-billion in 2020-21 and a debt-to-GDP ratio jumping to 49 per cent from 30 per cent. Don’t forget provincial debt, too. An Ontarian’s combined government debt-to-GDP ratio will push toward 100 per cent of GDP and beyond.

Such a high debt burden is an ailment that will become threatening when the economy returns to normal operations and interest rates rise. Just as we have done with the COVID-19 pandemic, we should address this ailment head-on. Fortunately, there is an evidence-based treatment plan.

The least painful treatment is to rely on economic growth to reduce our debt burden. However, it is risky to rely on growth alone when interest rates will eventually rise. Our second option is to control future spending once our economy returns to more normal conditions.

However, with an aging population, an unrelenting growth in health care spending and major climate change challenges, containing spending growth will be challenging.

Our third and most painful treatment is for governments to find more revenue.

If Canada has to raise additional taxes, we should be mindful of how exactly we do so. Not all taxes are created equal, and some taxes have a significantly more negative impact on our economy than other taxes. Relying on taxes that are a drag on growth creates a vicious cycle and further impairs our ability to manage our debt burden. More painful remedies would be required, such as squeezing, spending and then having to raise taxes further anyway.

So, what are the most – and least – harmful taxes from an economic perspective?

Personal and corporate income taxes are generally very inefficient ways of raising tax revenues. Although often attractive politically, further increases to personal and corporate income tax rates should be avoided, since that would worsen work and investment disincentives. Moreover, recent research suggests that reducing high marginal personal and corporate income tax rates in Canada could actually result in higher personal and corporate income tax revenues.

Some politicians market high progressive income tax rates as a tool to reduce income inequality in Canada. At best, this only addresses a symptom of income inequality, not the underlying root causes, such as access to education and health care and an open and flexible labour market. As an alternative, gradually increasing the tax rate on income from capital and capital gains could be used to address inequality in income and wealth.

Recently, we have heard calls for introducing a wealth tax in Canada to raise revenue and reign in income inequality. Many countries – notably in Europe – have tried to introduce a wealth tax and have largely abandoned it. Their experience has been that wealth taxes do not raise significant revenue, are difficult and expensive to administer and ultimately harm economic growth.

Consumption taxes, such as the goods and services tax or harmonized sales tax, are better choices for raising additional revenue while limiting the negative effect on economic activity. We recognize this is a populist flash point, but appropriately designed, consumption taxes can be progressive. Therefore, increasing consumption taxes should be the main source for raising additional tax revenues.

Taxing the digital economy is another option. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s efforts to create an international digital taxation framework are on life support, so Canada should examine how to tax the digital economy itself.

Following Quebec’s lead to subject e-commerce businesses located outside the province to its consumption tax is a start. It can generate significant revenue and level the playing field with conventional businesses.

Finally, governments worldwide are making significant efforts to ensure the economic recovery is a “green economic recovery.” Further increases to carbon taxes would make a positive contribution and can provide more revenue for managing our debt.

We have listened to our public-health experts in dealing with the medical aspects of COVID-19. We should now draw on economic and fiscal expertise in ensuring our economic recovery from COVID-19 is successful and robust.

Charlie, a colleague and leading expert in organizational transformation, was sharing observations on how he saw people faring throughout dozens of video meetings he had participated in over the past eight weeks; the consequence of a world forever changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. He wryly observed that 40-plus hours of video chat per week was driving a new behaviour where, despite significant effort, he was unable to make eye contact with anyone except himself. Disquieting but also fascinating.

I was also witnessing something. Our team members were working together, remotely from home, across four cities. In the process, they built new cultural dynamics for the entire company. Working remotely was improving team cohesion and, in turn, performance.

I believe that remote meetings can be a great tool for change, but it’s not a given that the change will be good. So how do we make sure we can work past our default behaviours to enable shared outcomes? How do we take advantage of this opportunity to redesign how we collaborate, for the better? How do we literally look past ourselves on screen to enable collaboration with other people?

Why meeting culture fails

Meetings are too important to be poorly designed. They involve the precious time of participants and they require patient, rigorous co-ordination. At best, a failed meeting wastes everyone’s time. At worst, it leads to incredibly stupid decisions, the likes of which can bring down a government or bring a company to the brink.

Most remote experiences are awful right now because we have not designed them to be great. Meeting hosts are focused on who to invite and what to present, instead of designing a process that enables participants to collaboratively produce the best outcomes. It’s the equivalent of hiring great cooks and buying terrible ingredients. You can hope for the best, but the laws of probability aren’t in your favour.

Too many of us are treating remote meetings as a temporary inconvenience until this is “all over” and we’re back in a room together. This is crazy. Teams will need to solve large complex problems long before it is safe to physically bring people together. And we will be using remote meeting technology for a long time to come.

I think we can generally agree that our in-person meeting culture wasn’t terribly great to begin with. We have a very hard-to-change set of behaviours and underlying assumptions about how we convene that we’re now applying to online spaces. There’s an opportunity now for us to create new meeting norms.

I think most people believe that meetings are perfunctory obligations to onboard many people to an idea despite it being designed by only a few. This comes at the cost of actual collaboration or multilateral problem solving. The outcomes are predetermined, creating winners who implement their ideas and losers who sit through meetings feeling an increased lack of association to the mission at hand. That’s why meeting culture fails.

Good meetings should cede control to enable collaboration

Good leaders know that a successful meeting is called with a purpose and designed to serve that purpose. Good meetings facilitate shared understanding, build cohesion and trust, and create a sense of shared intent. Most importantly, they enable powerful game-changing insights. They require ceding control to enable collaboration.

Story continues below advertisement

A well-designed meeting lets us see past what others want us to see into what we actually need to see so that genuine trust can manifest. Trust allows us to understand people and problems in all their contextual complexity. Meetings that enable trust are the ones worth showing up for. This is what meeting culture will need to be if we are genuinely preparing humanity for the challenges ahead.

There are a lot of crappy behavioural norms that come with traditional meetings that do not need to be emulated. Meetings are institutional by nature – and it’s important to confront an institution that no longer serves its intended purpose. Based on where things are at, what do we have to lose?

The sooner we acknowledge remote meetings as being both our reality and our opportunity, the sooner we will be able to successfully calibrate to our new circumstances. Then we can replace bad meetings with good ones.

Back in February, Toronto-based GMP Capital unveiled plans to swap its publicly traded stock for shares in partly owned subsidiary Richardson GMP. Winnipeg’s Richardson family is a significant shareholder of both companies, and the restructuring has been playing out over the past two years.

On Thursday, GMP Capital announced that, as part of the transaction, its shareholders will receive an additional 15 cents a share, or a total of $11.3-million, in a special dividend. It also said the Richardson clan will leave additional capital in the company to fund expansion by keeping $32.1-million invested in preferred shares, a holding the family was required to redeem.

In addition, GMP Capital changed the terms of the share swap with Richardson GMP’s owners, who include the firm’s 165 financial adviser teams. The company was planning to trade one GMP Capital share for every two shares of privately held Richardson GMP; now the ratio is one share for every 1.875 shares.

GMP Capital executives said the changes reflect a decline in Richardson GMP’s value after the sharp drop in interest rates in March, which cut into the profits it earns on its clients’ cash balances. In February, the transaction valued the entire franchise at $500-million; now the figure is $420-million.

“The revised terms to the previously announced transaction in February, 2020, strike what, we believe, is an appropriate balance taking into account the effects of the global pandemic, feedback raised by various stakeholders and retaining the appropriate level of capital to execute our long-term value creation strategy,” said Donald Wright, chair of the board at GMP Capital, in a news release.

Shareholders are scheduled to vote on the transaction on Oct. 6. If the deal is approved, the Richardson family will own approximately 40 per cent of Richardson GMP, the company’s financial advisers will have a 28.5-per-cent stake and existing GMP Capital shareholders will hold 31.4 per cent.

Last year, GMP Capital sold its capital markets business to St. Louis-based investment dealer Stifel Financial Corp., raising $42.2-million, in order to focus on managing money for high net worth individuals. Richardson GMP advisers currently oversee $29-billion of client assets, up from $23.5-billion when the stock market slumped in March.

“After a multiyear process to transform GMP, we can begin to capitalize on the considerable opportunities in the multitrillion-dollar wealth management industry in Canada,” said Kish Kapoor, interim president and chief executive of GMP Capital. He said that once the deal is completed, the company plans to recruit financial advisers from rival dealers, including the bank-owned firms, and will attempt to acquire small wealth management platforms.

“We believe, and the Richardson family believes, that the financial services ecosystem needs strong, high-quality independent firms,” Mr. Kapoor said. “Amongst many things, the health crisis has reminded us about the importance and demand for high-quality, face-to-face advice, especially during a period of volatile and uncertain markets.”

Notwithstanding inflated share prices, politics and the pandemic, the answer from many is a resounding “yes.”

That’s not just because unprecedented stimulus – US$20-trillion and counting – is forcing a structural change in how financial assets are valued.

It’s also down to years of societal shifts, innovation and now, the pandemic, which could transform forever the way people work, study and shop – playing into the dominant hand of tech stocks.

So while renewed coronavirus outbreaks and looming U.S. elections have made some investors cautious, many equity bulls are hanging in there, having already boosted the value of stocks globally by US$24-trillion since end-March.

As global equities near record highs, strategists say the quickfire bear-to-bull switch was not only justified but deserves to go further.

“The COVID pandemic has taken existing trends – greater dependency on tech, online shopping, remote working, etc. – and supercharged them,” said Benjamin Jones, a senior multi-asset strategist at State Street Global Markets.

With technology stocks holding on to their eye-popping gains, investors say the next leg of the rally is likely to come from value stocks – so called because they trade at cheaper valuations than their growth-oriented peers.

Stocks are benefiting of course from above-average equity-risk premiums, the return one can earn by holding stocks compared with risk-free assets. Global stocks carry an equity-risk premium of 4.6 per cent, while for U.S. stocks, it’s at 4 per cent.

That might erode over time, but for now interest rates appear firmly stapled to the floor.

As for valuations, they are hovering near 22 times forward earnings for the U.S. S&P 500 index, the highest since the dotcom bubble in early 2000. But then, the index too has changed dramatically with technology by far its biggest sector component.

Making up around a third of the benchmark index, they are the ultimate pandemic stay-at-home beneficiaries, especially those known as FANGMAN – an expanded tech group comprising Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and chipmaker Nvidia.

Their multiples of 80-100 times forward earnings have led the broader market higher.

Until a few decades ago, bank, oil & gas, and industrial stocks made up a bulk of the S&P 500. These sectors typically trade at lower multiples, given commodity price volatility and high capex needs – a major reason behind this year’s underperformance of Britain’s FTSE benchmark.

“What’s odd about the market debate is that it’s set up as follows: look at the S&P 500 and the response is the equity market is expensive. Then you ask people what they like and they favour a lot of the secular-growth, high-multiple stocks,” said Morgan Stanley chief cross-asset strategist Andrew Sheets.

A ratio of U.S. stocks on a market weighted basis to an equally weighted index of shares is at its highest levels since the 2008 crisis, indicating the dominance of the handful of large tech stocks in the market.

The valuations make all the more sense because of the lower for longer interest rate environment, said Maximilian Kunkel, CIO of Global Family Offices at UBS.

“As a result we remain constructive on risk assets even after the rally.”

Many others would seem to agree. On derivative markets, the put-to-call ratio for U.S. stocks, a measure of positioning sentiment, is the lowest since 2010. The ratio is inversely related to equity performance.

Some caution is although warranted, given that asset classes of all stripes have gained. A portfolio with a 25 per cent split in stocks, bonds, cash and gold would have earned a record 18 per cent in the past 90 days, BofA analysts calculate.

But the edifice is vulnerable to a rise in inflation, many argue, with investors’ holdings of yield-sensitive investments up US$8.1-trillion over 18 months, according to Morgan Stanley.

Though prices have rebounded from deflationary territory fairly quickly, inflation remains far below central bank estimates, indicating equity valuations will remain attractive.

Latest flows data shows investors are switching from cash to equities.

“I would still say investors are underweight equities and that provides a fairly decent backdrop for risk assets to rally,” said Jason Borbora-Sheen, portfolio manager at Ninety One Asset Management.

“We believe this latest settlement proposal would be viewed as a favourable outcome and would expect the stocks to react positively to the news as a global settlement would put the uncertainty behind,” JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill said.

The lawsuits accuse drugmakers of overstating the benefits of opioids while downplaying the risks and allege distributors failed to flag and halt a rising tide of suspicious orders.

With the U.S. election less than 100 days away, what are your concerns? Will the likely election of a Democrat as president make the markets nervous, or will the replacement of Donald Trump add confidence for the future? What should we as Canadian investors be considering?

Most polls are pointing to a decisive victory for Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. Oddsmakers also have Mr. Biden as a clear favourite to win on Nov. 3.

But whether a Biden victory will be good or bad for the stock market depends on whom you ask. Mr. Trump, predictably, has warned that stocks will “disintegrate” and “drop down to nothing” if he loses. His hyperbole aside, some investors have expressed concern that Mr. Biden’s proposals – including his plan to raise the corporate tax rate to 28 per cent from 21 per cent – could deal a blow to the economy just as it is recovering from the coronavirus pandemic.

But worries about a Democrat becoming president are almost certainly overblown, for a couple of reasons. First, the stock market is forward-looking, so market sentiment should already be reflecting, at least to some extent, a Biden victory. Yet, as Mr. Biden’s lead has widened to double-digits in many polls, the S&P 500 hasn’t fallen; it soared about 48 per cent from its March low – not the sort of reaction one would expect if investors were terrified of Mr. Biden becoming president.

Story continues below advertisement

Second, given the fragile state of the economy – and the fact that policy platforms are often subject to compromise after an election – it’s unlikely that Mr. Biden will try to ram through reforms that could deal a blow to the economy.

“Even in a scenario where the Democrats sweep the 2020 election … we still think it is unlikely that we see any fiscal-tightening measures in the near term,” Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist with RBC Capital Markets, said in a note this week.

“In fact, if the recent House bills are any indication … the path of least resistance should the Democrats sweep [the presidency and both houses of Congress] in November is for much, much more fiscal largesse,” to stimulate growth, Mr. Porcelli said.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. sounded a similarly optimistic note about a Democratic victory. “Given the current economic weakness, business recovery and job growth are likely to be prioritized over policies that could dampen economic growth and perhaps even jeopardize the desired 2022 midterm election outcome,” JPMorgan strategists, led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, said in a July note. “We see [Mr. Biden winning] as neutral to slight positive.”

Even if the market were to sell off initially, history suggests that the damage would be short-lived. In the five instances since the Second World War when the Democrats swept the presidency and Congress, the S&P 500 fell by an average of 2.4 per cent in November after the election. But the index gained an average of 10.4 per cent in the following calendar year, with just one decline, according to CFRA Research data reported by CNN.

A more pressing risk is how the market will react if the outcome of the election is contested. Given Mr. Trump’s call this week to delay the vote, his complaints about mail-in ballots and his refusal to say whether he will accept the results, it’s possible that he will not go quietly if he loses. Markets hate uncertainty more than anything, and such a scenario could rattle investors. In 2000, for example, in the five weeks from election day until George W. Bush was declared the winner after a recount dispute in Florida, the S&P fell 12 per cent.

With coronavirus, widespread social unrest and Mr. Trump’s unpredictable nature all creating a volatile election backdrop, a lot could happen between now and election day. It’s also possible that Mr. Trump could prove the polls wrong again and win a second term, although he would have to overcome Mr. Biden’s commanding lead to do that.

Story continues below advertisement

But my advice is the same now as in any other year, election or not: Own a diversified portfolio of high-quality stocks (or low-cost funds), keep a portion of your capital in guaranteed investment certificates or bonds, and have some cash on hand for emergencies.

Eventually, the pandemic will recede and, perhaps with the help of new leadership, the chaos gripping parts of the United States will pass and the economy will recover from its worst slump since at least the 1940s. Focusing on the long term, and resisting the urge to change your strategy based on an election – or any other short-term event – is the surest way to build wealth.

We start asking our youth this question almost as soon as they can speak. It’s usually asked with the best intentions, and followed with encouragement to keep working toward their stated career aspirations. However, as we examine the future of work and the transformational role that technology will play in it, this question may be setting an identity trap for our youth.

Technology will shape every single job that exists today. Studies show that technology may also replace up to 800 million of those jobs all together. Therefore, technology will likely augment or even replace the jobs associated with whatever career aspirations a primary schooler may have by the time they enter the work force.

Story continues below advertisement

Linear career paths, as we once knew them, will become a thing of the past. According to the Foundation for Young Australians, young people in school today are expected to have 17 jobs across five careers in their lifetimes. This has implications in North America – the same study was cited in leading U.S. future of work strategist Heather E. McGowan’s book, The Adaptation Advantage. In fact, 65 per cent of children entering primary school today will ultimately end up working in completely new job types that don’t yet exist.

Because of this, we need to prepare them for a complex and changing world and a life of continuous learning. Therefore, we should not impose on our youth the socially constructed belief that one’s career identity is static and anchored to a singular profession. Instead, we need to encourage children to explore what they love to do, figure out what they love to learn, and think of problems they would love to solve.

This is what this could look like in practice:

Repositioning our education systems around experiential learning, problem-solving, and learning how to learn;

Prioritizing digital literacy;

Teaching soft skills such as emotional intelligence and adaptability; and

Introducing age-appropriate real world problems during play and encouraging children to use what they have learned in school and at home, in combination with their imaginations, to solve them.

I engaged in real-world problem solving with my nieces and nephews during a recent video chat. My nieces and nephews (all under nine years old) have started growing vegetables in their garden. They beam with excitement at every vegetable harvest. I used this opportunity to discuss the problem of climate change and plastic pollution. I asked them how their gardening skills could help the planet. Their responses included solutions like “No longer needing to drive to the grocery store” and “No longer needing to wrap up food in plastic packaging.” I showed them photos of vertical farming structures and 3D printers. By the end of the conversation they were jumping with excitement about the idea of turning their porch into a “vertical farm” and “printing lunches and snacks” for their neighbours.

It’s impossible to predict how the technological revolution will unfold, including the jobs and industries that have yet to be invented. We can, however, support our youth to thrive in this complex and changing future by encouraging them to lean into their curiosities, explore their passions, and use what they are naturally endowed with: an imagination.

Since the pandemic began, Statistics Canada reports that Canadians spend far more time online than ever before. Activities that once required us to venture outside are now performed in front of a computer screen. Similarly, workers and employers seeking professional advice on their workplace rights are searching for that advice online. Increasingly, this is cause for concern.

Sales pitches

Internet-based marketing has become so pervasive that it can be hard to distinguish between a sales pitch and a genuine description of the law. Based on my observations, about half of the top search results produced by the leading search engines are advertisements, and half of those advertisements are paid for by companies looking to sell products or services that are not directly relevant. Companies or workers looking for legal advice can quickly be led far off into the wrong direction.

For example, when I searched for “employment standards act advice”, the first several results were paid advertisements that appeared to mimic government websites but were actually networks that claimed to put me in touch with a lawyer who would quickly answer my questions once I paid a small fee. The problem with these websites is that the “lawyers” who respond to such inquiries are generally not in Canada, and they may not even be lawyers at all. Be careful not to fall into these traps.

Advertising rules

Lawyers in Canada are governed by provincial regulatory bodies that place strict limits on how they are permitted to advertise online. For example, lawyers within Ontario are required to use a clear disclaimer when referring to past successes and they are forbidden from referring to awards or honours which were not credibly obtained by a legitimate third party. These rules are designed to protect consumers from being misled.

However, when researching for legal content online, it can be hard to detect an imposter. There is little stopping nonlawyers from advertising products or services, or even providing legal advice. These businesses dodge the regulatory requirements imposed on Canadian lawyers because they are not bound by them. For example, there is an international company offering workplace law advice to Canadian employers in Alberta, B.C. and Ontario. It does not actually consist of locally licensed lawyers because it does not follow any of the advertising rules in place. Without these safeguards, the general public has no way to verify that certain professional standards are met – and no one to complain to if not.

Jurisdictional issues

Each jurisdiction in Canada has its own unique employment standards legislation. There are also important distinctions between provincially and federally regulated employees (i.e. employees working in banking or telecommunications) that are critical to obtaining correct advice. Therefore, while it may be tempting to research a quick answer to “how much termination pay am I entitled to”, the correct answer first requires a proper understanding of the relevant jurisdictional framework and background terms of employment. When I speak with any prospective client, I have a comprehensive checklist of questions that I first need to have answered before I can confidently provide accurate advice.

Changes in the law

Even before COVID-19, workplace law was an extremely dynamic area, with constant changes to the law. However, since the pandemic began there is an almost-daily barrage of new developments and legislative amendments. Information posted online months or even weeks ago may no longer be precise. Search engine results are intended to be relevant – but they are not necessarily accurate.

The wrong question

Most internet searches for legal information are from individuals looking for a quick and simple answer to a legal problem they face. What is a constructive dismissal? How much severance pay should I receive? However, as any physician will tell you, the problem with self-diagnosis is that the underlying condition that you believe you have may be wrong. A temporary layoff may be a constructive dismissal for some employees. But if you are searching for whether it is a wrongful dismissal, which is a different legal concept, you may not receive the right answer.

Similarly, nuances in the law often require a more detailed explanation. There are actually separate and critically different meanings for severance pay in Canada. If you miss this distinction, your entire understanding of the concept will be wrong.

Unionized workers

Unionized employees cannot sue for wrongful dismissal but instead must file a grievance through their union. Without first qualifying this distinction, the answers to just about every online search for union workers will not be applicable to their matters.

Story continues below advertisement

The Internet is great for obtaining historical data points and a general direction of what to do next. But it is not a panacea for your workplace legal troubles. There is no substitute for actually conversing with a lawyer who can understand the nature of your problem and the dispute. Most law firms are now easily able to provide advice remotely.

As the COVID-19 pandemic started to spread, Tim Hortons reviewed its advertising plans and decided they no longer made sense as store closures, wide-scale layoffs and physical distancing upended life in Canada.

Instead, the coffee chain went back to the drawing board for two new ads. One informs customers how to buy doughnuts, double doubles and other products without going inside a restaurant, while the other follows Tim Hortons trucks delivering free coffee and doughnuts to essential workers.

“When we looked at what media we had committed to, we said: ’There’s a better way,“’ said Hope Bagozzi, chief marketing officer at Restaurant Brands International, the parent company for Tim Hortons.

Corporate spots acknowledging the pandemic have proliferated on TV breaks in recent weeks as companies grapple with how to fill previously purchased ad slots and what, if anything, they want to to say. How they proceed varies from brand to brand, but no one wants to risk appearing tone deaf during a national crisis.

“A lot of advertising — whether we want to admit it or not — is built on what has worked in the past,” said James Ansley, executive creative director at Grey Canada.

“It feels like right now, the rule book has been completely thrown out and we’re all trying to find our way through this.”

In the early days of the pandemic, Ansley saw companies do things that “felt a little bit ... lacking in meaning,” such as spacing out their logos in a nod to physical distancing. McDonald’s Brazil, for example, separated its golden arches mid-March, but later reversed the decision after facing criticism.

Companies are now trying to do something meaningful, said Ansley, by trying to help people feel safe and secure.

Utilitarian ads are one such attempt.

Tim Hortons released one in late March with an employee explaining drive-thrus are open and that app and delivery partners are accepting orders.

That ad was designed as “an accessibility spot” to answer questions the company was receiving from customers, said Bagozzi.

It’s notable that such ads aren’t geared toward selling products.

Ford Canada, for instance, created an ad thanking workers, and closing with information on how customers leasing or financing vehicles through its credit program could receive help.

BMO ran an ad thanking “all the front-liners for keeping our lives moving” without mentioning any banking services. A&W created an ad with a similar message of gratitude to its restaurant staff, essential workers and everyday Canadians “staying home to help stop the spread” that doesn’t show anything more than the fast-food chain’s spokesman, presumably in his own home, with a partial logo visible on the wall behind him.

The company wanted the gratitude to be authentic, genuine and dominant, said CEO Susan Senecal.

“That’s how we felt at that moment in time and we just wanted to express that completely,” she said. “We didn’t think anything more was necessary.”

A&W scrapped its original plans in this “very unusual set of circumstances,” Senecal said, and decided a message of thanks worked better.

The brands Ansley works with have “taken the foot off the pedal as far as pushing product,” which he thinks is the right move as staggering numbers of people apply for emergency government assistance.

More than one million jobs disappeared in March, according to Statistics Canada, and the unemployment rate increased 2.2 percentage points to 7.8 per cent.

“There’s a lot of people that are facing those realities,” Ansley said. “To go out with messaging that is tone deaf to that, I think, is completely wrong.”

Some brands have paused all their advertising in light of the pandemic, while others are trying to figure out if they have something to say, he said.

“I think really it’s just being true to your brand and your brand’s purpose.”

An example is a Dove Canada ad that presents a series of headshots of health-care workers, many of their faces showing indents from wearing their protective masks. The tagline “courage is beautiful” appears with the company’s logo and a list of donations the company is making to such workers.

The company’s long-runing “real beauty” campaign bills itself as a movement challenging traditional notions of attractiveness.

“That’s what makes it really powerful,” said Ansley. “It’s timely. It is a beautiful message. But most importantly, it just stays true to who they are as a brand.”

Similarly, Tim Hortons showcased its corporate values with the footage of real employees offering coffee and doughnuts to health-care workers, said Bagozzi.

The company didn’t know how it would use the footage when it first gathered it in March, she said, but after seeing the reaction decided to share it broadly.

“There was just such a nice reciprocal generosity and gratefulness that we were like, ‘Oh my gosh, this is so lovely. It’s so Canadian. We definitely want to share this.”

As the pandemic unfolds, it’s unclear what the future holds for advertising.

Tim Hortons ran a new ad recently offering a free pack of Timbits if customers spend at least $10. It’s intended as a nice gesture for families buying a meal, said Bagozzi.

The eatery is also looking at the activities it has planned for the rest of the year, especially the next few months, and asking what is most relevant and appropriate to be doing, she said.

The same can be said for A&W’s future advertising plans.

“As the situation continues to evolve, we’ll continue to think about what’s the most important thing to say next and try and do a good job of that,” said Senecal.

A potential coronavirus vaccine being developed by a unit of China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) could cost no more than 1,000 yuan ($144.27) for two shots, state media on Tuesday quoted chairman Liu Jingzhen as saying.

Sinopharm has said its experimental vaccine could be ready for public use by the end of this year. It has entered a late-stage human test in the United Arab Emirates to gather proof of efficacy for final regulatory approvals.

“It will not be priced very high. It is expected to cost a few hundred yuan for a shot, and for two shots it should be less than 1,000 yuan,” Liu told the Guangming Daily newspaper.

Governments and drugmakers around the world are in a frenetic race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. More than 200 candidates are in development, including more than 20 in human clinical trials.

Moderna Inc said earlier this month that smaller volumes of its experimental vaccine have been priced at $32-$37 per dose.

Last month, the U.S. government struck a deal for an experimental vaccine being developed by Pfizer and partner BioNTech SE that secures enough to innoculate 50 million Americans for about $40 a person.

Sinopharm’s Liu did not mention whether China’s state-backed nationwide insurance program would cover some of the vaccine costs for consumers, or whether it could be included in the country’s free vaccination scheme.

China National Biotec Group (CNBG), a Sinopharm unit, has moved two vaccine strains using the same method into human trials. Its plants in Wuhan and Beijing combined could make over 200 million doses of the drug annually.

U.S. drug developer Novavax Inc said on Monday that it is starting a mid-stage study of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine in South Africa, as the country experiences a surge in coronavirus cases. Reuters

The first firms in the robo business in Canada have either reached their five-year anniversary or will shortly. Although still a small segment of the investment advice business, robos have established themselves as a strong option for people seeking low-cost help in building and maintaining investment portfolios built mainly with exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.

Five years is also long enough for investors to get meaningful information about the returns generated by the portfolios robo-advisers use for clients. The 2019-20 Globe and Mail Robo-Adviser Guide will help you assess the return information that firms provide on their website.

The guide also includes detailed comparisons of the fees each robo-adviser charges. If you’re wondering what to expect in future returns from a particular robo firm, give more weight to low fees than stellar past results.

Prepare for a challenge in comparing returns at robo-firms. Some report monthly returns for the model portfolios they use for clients, others quarterly. Some offer comprehensive annualized returns, which are easiest to use for comparison purposes, while others use combinations of annualized, cumulative and calendar-year results.

All too often, benchmark comparisons are left out of the reporting on model-portfolio returns. Without benchmarks, you can’t properly grade returns.

The Globe and Mail Robo-Adviser Guide helps you assess returns by including information on:

Whether model portfolio returns are available for prospective clients to look at on a firm’s website;

The use of benchmarks for context in assessing portfolio returns;

Whether returns are shown with portfolio management fees deducted, as well as the cost of the ETFs used in the portfolio.

As ever, the guide covers all the key aspects of choosing a robo-adviser. You’ll find comparative information on the provinces and territories they operate in, the kinds of accounts they offer, how personalized their business is, the cost of their advice and the fees attached to the ETFs they use. As you’ll see, costs can vary by hundreds of dollars per year, even thousands.

A few common features of the robos that appear the Globe guide:

Paperless account-opening with e-signature is standard, so there’s no need to fill out paper forms and send them in;

Commissions for buying and selling ETFs in your account are generally included in the portfolio-management fee. Exceptions: Nest Wealth charges as much as $9.99 per trade with a cap of $100 per year, per account; Smart Money Capital Management charges 1 cent per share with a $4 minimum per trade.

Almost all firms use pre-set model ETF portfolios that match your investing profile; an exception is Nest Wealth, which provides unique portfolios for each client;

All rebalance your portfolio periodically – selling hot ETFs and buying cold ones – to bring you back to your target mix of stocks and bonds;

Assets are generally held at held by third-party or related investment dealers that are members of the Canada Investor Protection Fund, which protects eligible account assets for up to $1-million against dealer insolvency.

You can interact with your robo firm via its website, by phone and, often, through some combination of secure e-mail, live online chat and Skype.

You will encounter some strange but interesting people over the coming year, and it’s quite likely they will have far-reaching effects on the ways you choose to interact with the world. Always be open to new ideas and never turn your back on adventure.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

You seem to be thriving at the moment and long may it continue. The approaching new moon means that whatever efforts you make over the next few days the rewards will be considerable, so create something good and enjoy it to the full.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

It’s not like you to get emotional but something has forced your feelings to the surface and over the next few days no one will be left in any doubt what they are. Try to be positive in all situations and always keep a smile on your face.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

If you are in a position where you can break away from your usual environment for a while then don’t hesitate, just go for it. If you have to stay right where you are though there’s still plenty you can do to make life more exciting. Use your imagination.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

Now is the time to get serious about a money matter you have been deliberately avoiding in recent weeks. The upcoming new moon will bring with it the solution you require and it won’t be long before you wonder what all the fuss was about.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

This is the ideal time to clear out some of the junk in your life. In fact, the more you manage to get rid of now the more room you will create for the universe to bring in something better in the near future. Be ruthless with yourself.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

It would appear that you are involved in a situation you don’t know much about and now you feel out of your depth. Like it or not you will have to put your hand up today and ask for assistance from those in a position to rescue you.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

What can you do to make life more enjoyable for the people around you? Friendships are under excellent stars at the moment and the more you do for others now the more will be done for you later on – although that’s not your motivation, of course.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

If you want something enough you will find a way to get it, especially on the career front as you are determined to prove yourself and move up in the world. Just remember there is often a price to be paid for success. Make sure you can afford it.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

The approaching new moon will open your eyes to new possibilities and the more you are willing to believe that great things are possible the more the universe will send opportunities your way. Don’t be too rigid in your thinking. An open mind is a winning mind.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

There is no point feeling guilty about things you said or did in the past. It may be natural to experience some remorse but don’t overdo it. Everyone makes mistakes – yes, even a Capricorn – but not everyone learns from them. Make sure you do.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

Cosmic activity in the relationship area of your chart makes this the perfect time to reach out to the people you love and remind them how much they mean to you. Don’t just assume they know they have a place in your heart – prove it to them.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

Try not to make so much work for yourself. Delegate as much as you possibly can and, once you have given instructions, let others get on and finish the job without interference. They may not be as accomplished as you but they’ll still get it done.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

Don’t waste your precious time on people who you either don’t feel comfortable with or who seem to operate on a level you cannot relate to. You are under no obligation to hang around with them, so pick your moment and leave them behind.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Your ruling planet Mercury joins forces with both the sun and Mars today, which among other things will give you a clearer idea of what changes need to be made. Once you see the logic of sweeping away the past the idea will no longer terrify you.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

No matter how eager you are to press ahead with a new project you must give it more thought. Cosmic activity in the money area of your chart warns the cost of doing business may be higher than expected. It’s still worth it but watch the pennies.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

Something you have been worrying about for ages will soon be no more than a distant memory, so cheer up and approach what you have to do today with a glad heart. Life is getting better by the minute and soon you won’t want the days to end.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

Something that has taken up more of your time and energy than it is worth needs to be ended – now! With both the sun and Mercury moving into your sign over the coming week you must clear the decks for action – of which there will be plenty.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

How you deal with people is always important but over the next few days you will get opportunities to make the kind of friendships that last a lifetime. Remind yourself constantly that it’s not about what you achieve but how much you love and laugh.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

Listen carefully to what people who are more knowledgeable than you have to tell you today. Scorpios rarely take advice – you quite rightly trust your own inner voice – but on this occasion what you learn could save a lot of unnecessary work.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

You must be honest with yourself this week. There is no point pretending that something is working out well when clearly it’s not. Make use of the sun’s last few days in one of the more dynamic areas of your chart to begin some much-needed changes.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

Your powers of persuasion will be hard to resist today, but make sure you use them for positive reasons. If you try to sweet-talk people into giving you what you desire the universe will find ways to deny you. Be open and honest about your needs.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

Cosmic activity in your opposite sign has brought a lot of surprises of late, and no small amount of joy as well. Keep those feeling of warmth and wellbeing going as long as you can. Events matter, but how you choose to react to them matters more.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

You never like making unpopular decisions but you have no choice now. Someone you love has had plenty of chances to sort themselves out but still they are making the same old mistakes. Step in and get it sorted for them – which is what they want anyway.

Jerome Michael Yutaka Kinoshita: Father. Husband. Editor. Chef. Born June 26, 1951, in Hamilton; died Jan. 29, 2020, in Toronto, of complications from a stroke; aged 68.

To call Jerry a “foodie” would be doing him an injustice. Good food was something he truly adored. He could describe in detail a dish he had a decade ago as if it were yesterday. He also thoroughly enjoyed cooking – which his wife and two daughters perhaps never really appreciated until COVID-19 hit and they felt his absence in the kitchen.

Jerry was the youngest of three boys, his family part of a dark chapter in Canadian history. His parents had been interned in British Columbia during the Second World War and relocated to Ontario shortly after. He excelled in academics and sports, and his love of sports – both watching and playing – remained a core part of his life.

After studying journalism at Ryerson, he landed a job in 1974 at The Globe and Mail and found himself so at home he spent 42 years there, briefly as a writer and then as an editor. Writers appreciated how calm and patient he was, while fellow editors relied on his vast general knowledge and mastery of spelling and grammar. Much as Jerry loved his colleagues, he hated mistakes. For several years, his were the last eyes to see stories about to be published, scouring them for typos and breaches of The Globe’s often-bizarre style guidelines.

He worked on many major news events, but perhaps his proudest was as lead editor on a story about Toronto’s “hidden homeless.” The following spring, he was in the audience to hear journalist Margaret Philp sing his praises while accepting a National Newspaper Award.

Jerry rarely brought his work home. Apart from his willingness to edit his daughters’ school work, he saved that side of himself for the office. At his celebration of life, former colleagues shared hours of stories about how Jerry’s talent made them better writers and editors, how he loved to brag about his daughters’ accomplishments and how everyone in the newsroom knew how badly he wanted his favourite teams to succeed.

He and Janice, who married in 1989, had many shared interests, from good food and wine to basketball and baseball. They had been friends for many years and few were surprised when they finally fell in love. Off the job, Jerry did not make friends easily, and often balked at going to dinners and parties, but once there, he always had a great time. In the summer, he escaped to the cottage, often polishing off a detective/spy novel (or two) in a day before dinner with Janice on the deck, enjoying a glass of wine and a beautiful sunset.

Much of Jerry can be found in his daughters, but Christine, 26, and Laura, 23, also had an impact on him. They inherited his love of food, going so far as to create an Instagram account dedicated to it where Chef Jerry became a staple. When they developed more complicated relationships with food, he adapted. When Christine became a pescetarian, he adapted and accepted that now he’d rarely get to eat red meat, something he loved. She would text him recipe ideas, only to find he’d already bought all the ingredients by the time she got home.

He left The Globe in 2016 and, until his stroke last October, devoted retirement to travelling with Janice, playing golf with his brother, watching the Raptors win a championship, hoping every year would finally be the year for the Habs and spending quality time with his daughters. His dedication to his family was genuine and rare.

Jerry’s legacy endures through his intellect and talent, and of course the many dishes he had mastered. To honour him on his birthday, Laura made his famous Jamaican seafood stew, with a slight modification: much more seafood than the recipe calls for. Jerry would have certainly shaken his head, but eaten it with a smile.

Anyone who thinks you will compromise on a point of principle is going to be disappointed. You don’t care how much it might cost you financially, you have never been one to back down when you know you are right, and you are not about to start now!

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

A sudden setback may catch you by surprise but the fact is you should have seen it coming. It is a universal law that the more expansion there is in one direction the bigger the deflation when the bubble finally bursts. You’re at that point now.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

What happens over the next 48 hours will come as a reminder that the moment you reach a point where you think you are in full control the universe will start taking that control away from you. Change is the only thing that is certain in life.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

Resist the temptation to make a big deal of something that is of quite minor importance. The only reason it seems so dramatic is because you are feeling with your heart when you should be thinking with your head. Hopefully, common sense will prevail.

You need to put yourself about over the coming year. You need to show your face in places where important people gather. Half the battle in life is just turning up, and if you are always around when others need you the rewards could be substantial.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

There is never a wrong time to be an Aries and as things stand it’s a great time right now. The sun in Leo means you have the energy and ambition to go all the way, so don’t listen to those who tell you to tone down your act.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

Not everything will go your way today and over the weekend but most things will, so resolve to ignore the small stuff and focus only on the bigger picture. Where relationships are concerned though, be warned: a secret infatuation won’t stay secret for long.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

You dislike restrictions at the best of times and you will absolutely hate them today. Be that as it may, there are a number of things you must do for other people before you get the chance to move on. Do them with a smile on your face.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

You may come into money over the next few days, but don’t be tempted to rush out and spend it all in one go. Cosmic activity in the main financial area of your chart warns you need to control the more impulsive side of your nature.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

Cosmic activity in and around your birth sign makes you super ambitious, which is great, but other aspects warn you need to take care when dealing with people in positions of power. Why? Because their interests may be seriously at odds with your own.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

Try not to be too trusting over the next 24 hours, because if others get the idea that you will agree to anything they will most likely ask you for everything. It’s not wrong to put your own interests first – in fact right now it’s essential.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

You appear to be overthinking a situation that is really quite straightforward. Your best course of action by far is to follow whatever your first instincts happens to be, because that comes from the part of you that knows all the answers.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

There could be things happening in your job or career that you probably don’t much enjoy, but over the longer-term the changes now taking place will benefit you in numerous ways. Trust that the universe knows what you need – and quit worrying!

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

Over the next few days you will gain a number of very useful insights into the way the world works. Once you have understood that everything in your life happens for a reason it should be easier to tailor your actions to the greater reality.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

Instead of trying to improve your circumstances every which way, try enjoying things the way they already are. Your success and happiness depend more on the mental attitude you choose to adopt than on how ambitious you are or how much money you make.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

Make a serious effort to see the situation you are in from someone else’s point of view. It won’t be easy for someone whose opinions are as inflexible as yours, but if you can do it then it could open up a whole new world of creative possibilities.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

We had some rules about getting a dog: female, 40 pounds, short-haired, and most importantly, not anxious.

“You’re enough,” my partner said, not unkindly, but because there isn’t room in our tiny Vancouver apartment for more anxiety.

Story continues below advertisement

We failed on all counts and ended up with Shermy, a two-year-old male dog. Sixty-two pounds of constant shedding, thanks to his golden retriever/lab/shepherd/collie mix undercoat. The places I find fur mystify me.

There are things people don’t tell you about getting a rescue dog, like your dog may be afraid of garbage cans. Baby strollers. Bike helmets. Umbrellas. Cameras with telephoto lenses. The hiss of a bus lowering. Sneezing. The ironing board. The iron.

No one tells you about doggie Prozac, or that their dog is on it and yours might need to be too.

Instead, we’re bombarded with moving stories about rescue dogs whose personalities blossomed once they found good homes. We consume sob-inducing videos about dogs who understand their good fortune and become the goodest doggos ever seen after they’re adopted. We see dogs who were afraid to be touched become cuddle-obsessed babies.

I devoured those stories before adopting Shermy. Change a dog’s life, and by doing so, change your own. I bought the narrative because that’s what friends and acquaintances, not just the Internet, told me.

No one mentions the dogs that never reach normal ‒ until you get your own problem furry friend. Then, the stories you hear from fellow dog-owners. Dogs on three or four anxiety meds; dogs who hate their owners’ partners; dogs who ate the entire couch; dogs that run a half-marathon and still have energy to jump on horrified strangers.

Of course, no one tells you your dog may be reactive or have fear aggression and anxiety brought on by improper socialization, and they may never get over it. Our dog trainer looked at us sympathetically as she broke that news to us.

Story continues below advertisement

We weren’t surprised, exactly. Most of Shermy’s actions were recognizable. Dog anxiety doesn’t necessarily manifest that differently from human anxiety, but I can articulate my symptoms before my behaviour gets out of control. I know what the racing heart, trouble breathing, catastrophic thoughts on repeat, panic attacks and tingling fingers mean, and can usually identify what’s causing them.

Canines don’t have that luxury. The only way Shermy lets me know how he’s feeling is through his actions, which are immediate and tend to fall into the less-than-acceptable categories of snarling, yelping and furiously lunging with his hackles up. I see people’s judgment sometimes: I’m the bad dog-owner with the bad dog.

Shermy’s anxiety is noticeable. He lashes out at strangers, startles at noises (and sometimes at nothing), and melts down at the slightest change in routine. Predictability is useful in anxiety management, but often impossible. There’s only so much I can do ‒ for him and for myself. I’ve snapped at strangers as well, because anxiety overrode my ability to behave in a socially responsible way.

Shermy can be embarrassing at the park because he’ll bark incessantly at the dog he wants to play with. No one wants to play with the barking dog. He’s more likely to drive a furry friend (and their human) away by doing the wrong thing. He’s a master of avoidance, and will pull me as hard as he can away from something that makes him uncomfortable. When I’m anxious, I avoid people and places too ‒ even people and places I usually like.

Anxiety dulls people’s abilities to react appropriately or make rational decisions. Trauma, real or imagined, is magnified by this frantic thundering in your chest that doesn’t belong, but has made room for itself anyway. Threats seem to come from every direction and every task feels insurmountable. When Shermy can’t cope, he can’t react in a calm way. Everything becomes a disaster. Life is unmanageable. I get it.

Humans don’t always pay attention to how anxious feelings make us act. We fixate on how we feel, not on what we’re doing in response to the feelings. My own behaviour patterns are clearer to me after watching Shermy’s reactions.

Story continues below advertisement

I would like to be able to tell you that having an anxious dog has made it easier to treat myself with compassion and empathy. That I’ve softened toward myself when I’m feeling anxious for “no reason,” instead of being annoyed with my stuttering progress toward less anxiety. It would be a nice story ‒ a tidy ending. It would better fit with the narrative we see on Instagram and YouTube about dogs who thrive in their new lives and the people who experience new levels of happiness because of their pets. These are lovely, heartwarming stories, and we need simple joys right now.

But that’s not what’s happened. Sometimes, Shermy’s car-whimpering, leash-pulling, startling, midnight-barking, pacing and aggression toward people half a block away cause me more anxiety. His unpredictability upsets my own need to avoid surprises.

The thing about Shermy is that he is a good dog. He puts his own toys away. (Only sometimes. He’s a dog.) He hasn’t devoured any designer shoes. He snuggles like a champ and plays adorably with toys. He zooms around with other dogs, who don’t bother him the way unfamiliar humans do. When we sleep in and he needs to pee, he slides his head under my neck to wake me up. We stick our hands in his mouth to clean his teeth and he lets us clip his toenails without flinching. He doesn’t hump strangers, roll in mud, chase cars or beg for food. He sits contently by my desk for hours while I write and has no idea that I’m sharing his embarrassing secrets with everyone. If anyone but him is being hugged, he trots over to join in. He’s a decent listener ‒ if there are no squirrels around.

Shermy’s main issue is he believes that every little thing in the world, from empty garbage cans to hats left behind on boxwoods, to skateboarders and the husky down the street, is going to attack him at any second and that he needs to attack first. Alternately, he’ll dig his heels in and refuse to walk past a shopping bag or an oddly shaped bush. Anxiety loves avoidance.

There are beautiful days when Shermy moseys on his leash without ripping my arm from its socket and wears a giant, squishable retriever grin. People smile at him when we walk past and I imagine them thinking, “What a sweet dog.” Sometimes, strangers tell him he’s a good boy. He usually chooses that second to bark at them.

Shermy’s good-boy moments remind me that he is more than his anxious behaviour. He’s more than one thing. He loves us and we love him. Mostly. If Shermy is more than his anxiety, then surely I am too. That’s helpful to remember on bad days when panic is winning, nothing is normal, and I still need to function like a human adult. Maybe this is a heartwarming dog story, after all.

With Mars and Pluto active on your birthday you won’t lack for energy over the 12 next months, but you need to use that energy in positive ways. The line between creation and destruction can be exceedingly thin, so make sure your mind always governs your emotions.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

Make sure you are in control today. Make sure everything, at home and at work, is done the way you want it to be done. Not everyone will be happy about it, of course, but what can they do? When you are this dynamic there’s just no stopping you.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

Over the past few months you will have noticed that even when there was disruption in your life it seemed to work out well in the end. It may not be so easy to see the light behind the dark now – but it’s still there, so don’t stop looking.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Make it your business to encourage a friend or family member today, especially if they seem to be losing heart over a project they once had high hopes for. A little bit of praise could make all the difference, and get them fired with enthusiasm again.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

You just cannot sit still at the moment – there is so much that needs to be done and there never seems to be enough time. What happens over the next few days should convince you that running about here, there and everywhere is not the answer.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

Whatever you choose to do today you will tackle it with passion and power, and that’s great. But you also need to make sure that what you do has a purpose, one that benefits not just you personally but those you interact with on a daily basis.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

Today’s Mars-Pluto link is sure to bring your hidden anger to the surface, and it may not be a pretty sight! No doubt you are entitled to be annoyed with people who have let you down, but will shouting at them solve anything? It rarely does.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

Don’t be afraid to discuss your dreams and desires with someone you trust. You may be worried that they will pour scorn on what you want to do with your life, but it’s far more likely they will encourage and assist you, and that’s what you need.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

Pluto, your ruler, links with Mars, planet of anger, today and it’s likely that whatever resentment you feel against certain people will come to the surface. It may be right to get annoyed with them but don’t get so annoyed that you endanger your own reputation.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

You may believe that the best way to get what you want is to take it, but give that some thought before you act on it. Even if you are successful in the short term you could set up counter forces that cause all sorts of problems later on.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

You cannot always get your own way, no matter how much power you have, and that is a lesson you will need to learn over the next few days. Today’s Mars-Pluto link warns you are by no means the only one with desires that demand to be met.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

You need to take a money matter a lot more seriously than you have been taking it in recent weeks. The planets indicate that some sort of crisis is about to occur and if you treat it as a joke the joke will most likely be on you.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

Yes, of course, there is nothing you cannot do in life, but some things are going to be easier than others. Be smart and focus on those aims that don’t require you to prove yourself by putting everything on the line. Life doesn’t have to be hard.

Like many others, my husband and I are working from home currently. I am aware that I am very fortunate to have a job that allows work from home, so I’m not complaining – much. However, my job very much depends on the ability for people to freely enter and exit Canada, so work has been up and down over the past few weeks. My day-to-day was becoming increasingly unproductive as the coronavirus wreaked its havoc throughout the spring. I needed a project.

Baking bread was not a contender, nor was a backyard DIY project, despite the Instagram posts that tried to convince me how satisfying these accomplishments could be. I am certain that all would be disappointed with the outcome of such experiments. With our youngest’s seventh birthday coming up in short order, and no prospect of a party with his friends, we came up with a plan. We would make a pinata – a pinata in the shape of a coronavirus particle. We had no intention of trivializing the disaster that affected so many people; we just liked the idea of children bashing the hell out of this thing that has caused everyone so much upheaval and stress.

Story continues below advertisement

I had never before made anything out of papier-mâché, but I was undeterred. With a general mistrust of well-meaning internet advice-givers, I blew up a balloon and set to work to figure it out myself. Precious flour that would never find its way into a loaf of bread was boiled with water, creating a gooey paste in no time at all. Strips of newspaper bearing the depressing headlines of the day were repurposed, covered up and transformed into a sphere that we could blast to smithereens. Ah, the symbolism. We were nailing this.

Three layers of bad news adhered, I left the balloon to dry thinking I’d wake up in the morning to find a hardened, perfectly formed orb. Alas, it was still sopping wet when I prodded it, coffee in hand. That’s okay, I can adapt and improvise, I told myself, just like the real virus is teaching me to do. I popped the balloon and watched it turn into a cratered moon as it collapsed. A hair dryer (sort of) did the trick (used on and off for a mere four hours) but its mottled appearance now gave it away as endearingly homemade.

Our pinata was now going to need stuffing. Here, I planned to shine. I wasn’t going to fill it up with run-of-the-mill candy for them to sit around and eat while cooped up in the house all day. Mentally nourishing trinkets like mini books and wooden science kits from the local independent bookstore were the ticket. However, I left nowhere near enough time for such supermom antics. Perhaps Walmart would suffice? Nope, the three-block-long lineup was too much to endure. The grocery store would be just fine. I left with half-price Christmas candy, packs of Mentos and Jell-O powder. For good measure, I stopped at a local bakery and bought the only two wrapped treats they had. More savoury than sweet, I knew they would not be popular, but felt I should do my part to support local business, however small the gesture.

During a video call that evening with family across the continent, my brother-in-law recommended we reinforce the top of the pinata and weaken another area so that the innards would actually fall out, avoiding the disappointment of the whole thing falling to ground after one swat. An engineer, he had honed his pinata-making skills while hosting annual Cinco de Mayo parties that conspicuously involved no children – they take their grown-up kid-style parties seriously in San Francisco. A coat hanger, cardboard and tape were strategically affixed the next day, the candy encased with more bad news and homemade glue. The pinata was now heavy, oblong, unsightly and moist. Was this really going to work?

My husband suggested we let the mess dry outside, in the sliver of sunshine we enjoyed that day after weeks of rain. It sounded like a good idea at the time. Unfortunately, the next morning we awoke to find that opportunist squirrels were undeterred by the multitude of COVID-19 warnings broadcast all over the pinata, leaving a damp hole in our masterpiece and candy wrappers stashed in all our plant pots. Muttering expletives, I began round three of papier-mâché adhesion to patch the hole, now enclosing just half the amount of candy originally planned. The headlines affixed to the craft were not getting any cheerier.

Two days later, the misshapen lump was fairly dry. We now turned our mind to aesthetics. How were we going to make the spiky bits of the virus particle? What colour was it going be? In the spirit of collaboration, I let my husband’s ideas prevail after some tense debate. They turned out to be good ones. Accepting advice often gets better results. I knew that rationally, but sometimes control is hard to forfeit – a lesson the past few months have only highlighted for me.

Our coronavirus pinata was completed just in time for the actual birthday. We Zoomed the grandparents to display it proudly, including them in the party as best as possible under the circumstances. They would have preferred a hug, but they appreciated the diversion and the story of the pinata to impart to their friends on their respective upcoming video calls, sharing the anecdote across continents.

We e-mailed a few neighbours with kids, suggesting they come to the nearby schoolyard that afternoon with their own bat or golf club in hand to take a swing while safely physically distanced. We had a few takers, and met on the soccer field, eliciting a few smiles and even a cheer from a few others out for their walks or runs around the track. It felt good to be making eye contact with strangers and sharing something with the community outside of our household, even if from a distance. With a swift and decisive blow, our eldest broke through the pinata, leaving the show-stopping explosive final wallop for the birthday boy.

Candy flew everywhere, to the delight of children and adults alike. The vanquished virus was left limp and spinning, cracked and enfeebled. The pinata was no longer the focal point as attention shifted to the candy below – a welcome reward for the time, effort and commitment it took to understand and then defeat it.

Our pinata forced our resourcefulness and co-operation. Invaluable advice from our international community (all the way from San Francisco) was key in making our efforts stronger and more effective, which is proof of the power of collaboration. The project took a lot longer than anticipated, and the process was more involved and complicated than we expected it to be. We demolished it together, turning a birthday party expected to be clouded with misfortune into an experience that we will remember fondly forever. Ah, the symbolism. We nailed it.

There will be times over the coming year when you want nothing more than to retreat from the chaos of the world. That’s fine, of course, but it’s unlikely you will stay away from the game for long. A little chaos can be quite exciting.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

You will have to make some tough financial decisions over the next few days, and they are more likely to be correct decisions if you think less about how much you might win or lose and more about what those decisions could mean for other people.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

A great many things are changing in your world, but on balance they are doing you a lot of good, so don’t try to avoid them. In the greater scheme of things all change is positive, so find ways to go with the flow rather than struggle against it.

You need to resolve to spend less time worrying what other people think about what you are doing and more time actually doing it. There will always be those who are critical of your actions, and those are the people you need to pretend don’t exist.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

You need to come out of your shell and step into the limelight. Believe it or not you are immensely popular with just about everyone at the moment, and if you can leverage that approval there is no limit to what others will do for you.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

You don’t have to do anything special to get ahead in the world, you just have to carry on doing what you are doing to the best of your abilities – and your abilities are way above average. You will impress important people over the next few days.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

When I was a girl, my brother and I spent the last few weeks of our summer vacation with my grandmother who lived in a small town south of Montreal. By mid-August, I’m sure most other kids were thinking about going back to school. But at Grandma’s house, all I could think about was corn – sweet, crunchy corn.

The town was surrounded by cornfields, and by that time of the year, the stalks were “as high as an elephant’s eye,” to borrow the famous lyric from Oscar Hammerstein.

My family ate corn at other times of the year but it came from the freezer or a can. In August, we got to eat corn in its perfect form – freshly picked, boiled and eaten right off the cob.

Story continues below advertisement

During the short corn season, my grandma would often drive us around to the farm stands at the edge of the fields where she would carefully inspect a few ears. Any more than a few hours off the stalk, and she would declare the corn too “old” to eat. But if she approved of what was available, we would pack three, four or five-dozen cobs (or more) into big paper bags. The amount depended on how many relatives would be joining us for the feast to come.

Corn on the cob brought our family together in a way no other food could. It was also a lot of fun to eat.

Back at the house, my great-grandmother, who was in her early 90s at the time, would be waiting in the kitchen to bring several huge pots of water to a boil. My brother and I had the job of shucking the corn. Cousins, aunts and uncles who lived nearby would start to arrive as we sat on the steps of the back porch violently separating husks from cobs then carefully removing the silk. If I discovered a live worm wiggling between the kernels, I’d squeal in horror. This usually brought an adult to the screen door, a bottle of beer or Coke in hand, to check on our progress. If we were working too slowly, they’d come out to help.

Once the shucking was done and the corn was boiled, we were ready to eat. Grandma brought big plates piled high with steaming cobs to the kitchen table, set simply with two large blocks of butter and shakers of salt. We all sat tightly together, elbow to elbow. Sometimes, if there were too many of us, I’d have to sit on an adult’s lap. Back then, we could never have imagined the need for physical distancing.

The wait for the cobs to cool enough to grasp with my hands was almost unbearable, but my family were purists. We would never think of using those silly little yellow cob-shaped plastic forks. There is nothing more satisfying than gripping the real thing between your fingers.

When the corn had cooled, everyone fought for their turn at the salt and butter. Then there was a kind of hush as everyone took their first bite. There was an urgency to our enjoyment. Each of us was aware, I think, that eating sweet corn this fresh was a glorious but fleeting pleasure.

Eating corn on the cob is messy business. That was another thing that made it special. I could eat with my hands, my fingers crusted in salt and my face flecked with kernels, and nobody scolded me about table manners.

Story continues below advertisement

After the first round of cobs had been devoured, everyone began to relax. We’d race each other to see who could finish a cob first. We’d debate about the correct way to eat corn on the cob. Do you spin the cob like a wheel, gnawing around the circumference? Or do you run your teeth back and forth, like an old typewriter, nibbling the kernels horizontally? Even my usually stern great-grandmother, with butter glistening on her chin, grinned like a kid.

The conversation during these meals was always lively. The adults would compare the quality of the current year’s crop with previous harvests. This inevitably led to family stories from the past like how, as children, Grandma and Aunt Ilene accidentally ran over Uncle Bernie with the horse and buggy on their way to school one day. Another favourite was one about an unfortunate cat that got killed when a bolt of lightning shot straight through the old farmhouse from the front to the back screen door during a summer storm.

Although I believed them completely at the time, I know now that these stories had only a kernel of truth to them – pardon the pun. Listening to my family try to outdo each other with exaggerated tales taught me that the veracity of some stories is not as important as the enthusiasm put into telling them to entertain the people you love.

I have no idea how many cobs we actually ate in one sitting, but there were rarely more than a few left over. Eventually, we’d haul ourselves up from the table and head to the front porch of the house. In a state of happy lethargy, we quietly enjoyed the warm, gentle dusk that settles over Quebec’s Eastern Townships in late summer.

I moved away from that part of the country a long time ago. Many of the corn-eaters I sat with around my grandma’s kitchen table are gone now. But, every year around this time, when the corn is high in the fields, I remember what they taught me. Savour the end of summer. Enthusiastically devour the bounty it brings. And never, ever eat corn on the cob alone.

One of the most important milestones in the growth of a grape vine is taking place in vineyards across the country and throughout the northern hemisphere. Véraison is when the vine turns its energy to ripening the grape clusters. Prior to this transformation, grapes are hard, green, and bitter. In a few months, they’ll be ripe and ready.

It’s hard to miss véraison’s effect on the vines as the grapes grow in size, soften and change colour. Berries in red wine varieties shift from green to purple, while white wine selections turn yellow-green or golden. The fruit of all grape varieties will transform into something more sweet, aromatic and pleasant to taste.

Aided by warm, sunny and dry weather, véraison can start in some regions as early as July.

In the wine-growing areas of Ontario and British Columbia, it’s just under way. From this point, it can take a month or two until the grapes are ready to harvest for wine production. The time from véraison to harvest differs for each grape variety, depending on how much sun and warmth they require to fully ripen.

Sparkling wine producers in the Napa Valley received their first grapes last week, marking an early start to that region’s 2020 harvest. Grapes for sparkling wine are harvested with higher acidity levels, which helps create the desired crisp and refreshing style of wine. Grapes for Napa’s famous cabernet sauvignons and chardonnays remain on the vine.

Elsewhere, véraison is a signal to winemakers to gear up for harvest.

By the time véraison is nearly complete, grape growers can see which clusters are lagging behind. Those clusters are often removed to promote more even ripening and ensure the remaining bunches receive as many nutrients and sugars from the vine as possible.

Growers may also decide to trim leaves off of the vine to expose the fruit to more sunlight, which aids ripening.

Usually one of the most anticipated times of year in the vineyard, véraison comes with its own unique set of challenges in 2020. Many vineyards face decisions that go beyond ensuring ripe grapes and wine quality this year.

Story continues below advertisement

Mounting economic uncertainty in the wake of lost sales and marketing opportunities due to the pandemic has led to cancellations of grape contracts in Canada and beyond. The grape glut in California and throughout the European Union has only gotten worse due to COVID-19.

Many wineries are cutting back production to manage inventory issues. So-called “crisis distillation” is being practiced in France and elsewhere to reduce the surplus of wine. There are a number of grapes on the vine that don’t have a buyer in place and are looking for a home.

Canadian growers and wineries also face added pressure after having lost a federal tax exemption that was challenged by Australia at the World Trade Organization. Australia successfully argued the excise exception for Canadian wine producers was a trade restriction to wines made down under. As a result, there’s an expected 50-cent per bottle price increase to Canadian wines as of June 30, 2022. That’s right around the time many of the best wines made this year will start appearing on shelves.

You appear to have reached a stage in your life where you are ready to commit to your dreams 100 per cent. Your courage and commitment in pursuit of a cause will win you many friends and allies this year. Together you’ll change history for the better.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

Act tough today. Give those you deal with, both at work and on the street, the clear impression that if they give you a hard time they will get it back tenfold. You can be quite intimidating at times, and that fact will work in your favour.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

It’s not easy being patient with people who seem to stretch everything out twice as long as it needs to go, but stay calm and don’t lose your temper. You may find, once they finally get to the point, they’ve got something to say that’s worth listening to.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Push yourself a little bit harder than usual today, because the planets indicate that extra effort will pay off big time. That applies not only to your work but also to affairs of the heart. Take time to let the one you love know how much you really care.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

In one way you will gain financially today, but in another way you will lose more than you expected. On balance you should come out at least even, so don’t let any losses get you down – almost certainly they are no more than temporary.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

You may not want to get involved with someone who is clearly being provocative for the fun of it, but if you don’t clamp down on their stupidity now you could be subjected to it even more later on. You’ve got better things to do with your time.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

This should be an enjoyable day for you but it might be spoiled if you allow someone’s negative attitude to get you down. Whatever they say, and no matter how logical it may sound, resolve to ignore it. Be positive at all times and in all situations.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

Do you take what a friend or work colleague tells you seriously? You should know from past experience that this particular individual is not to be trusted – not necessarily because they are dishonest, but because they are so easily fooled themselves.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

You may have total and utter faith in your own abilities but the planets warn there is a danger you could overreach yourself and end up having to backtrack at the very last moment. Try looking ahead a bit rather than rushing in where angels fear to tread.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

You have never been one to watch what you say and it’s inevitable today that some of your opinions will upset those of a delicate disposition. That’s too bad. There is no reason at all why you should tone down your act to protect others’ sensitive natures.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

If you must spend money over the next 24 hours either make it other people’s money or make sure you can get a refund later on. Jupiter in your sign is making you a bit extravagant at the moment, so keep your cash in your pocket if you can.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

You will call it as you see it today and won’t care in the slightest if your honesty upsets people. It seems to be part of your role in life to say things that less radical types believe should be left unspoken. Say them often and say them loud.

By all means enjoy the good things in life, and don’t feel bad if not everyone around you is able to share in your delight. Just because you are sensitive by nature does not mean you have to take the cares of the world on your shoulders.

When schools were closed this spring and my partner and I were working from home, our children had such a difficult time entertaining themselves while we worked. Do you have any tips for helping kids play by themselves?

I’ve been asked this question a lot over the past few months. A few things to consider before I dive in to offer solutions: What are your child’s age, temperament and experience level? Generally, children get better at playing alone as they get older and have more experience finding things to do on their own. Some children are just born better at entertaining themselves. Other children, even if you try all the suggestions below, have a much harder time. Try not to think of it as something you or they have done wrong and keep working on it.

Start with connection Children are always more willing to play alone when their connection needs are met. Start the day playing with your child: “I’m all yours for the next 30 minutes before I start working. What would you like to play?”

Story continues below advertisement

Keep them near Generally children will be happier to play alone if they can be physically near you. They might have a play area in the kitchen while you are doing food prep, or you can set up your home office and a play area in your living room.

Use a visual timer Start with small chunks of time, like 15 or 30 minutes, and use a visual timer so they can see how much time is left.

Don’t interrupt If your children are playing independently, let them stay in the flow. Don’t ask questions, get involved or interrupt unless you absolutely have to.

Provide an environment conducive to play Get rid of everything your children don’t play with. Put some toys in rotation so that when they make an appearance after a few weeks away, they feel new again. Have labelled bins and shelves to make it easy to find something to play with and put it away. You might spend more time tidying up, but you will be rewarded with more uninterrupted time.

Play audiobooks, podcasts or music to keep them company My daughter would play for hours with her toys if she had a good audiobook to listen to. Most libraries have apps for borrowing audiobooks.

Put together some special “play alone” materials Assemble some lidded bins with different activities in them. One parent in my community shared that she enjoyed quiet time every day by employing this strategy. She changed out the contents of the bins daily with things like “rocks, shells, washable markers, playdough, picture books, old magazines, puzzles, spoons with containers for scooping pom pom.” Stickers, small notebooks, tape and pipe cleaners would also be great additions.

Add water A bath in the middle of the day (unsupervised is safe for kids age 6 and up) or a sink full of water with bubbles, scoops and funnels will keep kids busy for a long time.

Try some sensory play activities Playdough is an old favourite that never goes out of style. Modern takes on playdough are goop or slime that can be made with household ingredients. Think indoor sandbox.

It takes some effort and advance planning on your part and you might need to call on your reserves of patience, but if you start small, support them and keep insisting, most kids can learn to love their independent time.

You have always been one for big ideas, and there is nothing wrong with that, but don’t let those ideas run away with you to such an extent that you set yourself targets that cannot be reached. Even Leos have limits – but within those limits greatness is possible.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

No matter how persuasive an Aries you may be, if others don’t want to take your advice there is not much you can do about it. In fact, the planets indicate you might be better off keeping your ideas to yourself. Why waste them on those who can’t understand?

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

You may not get along with someone you work with but you are strongly advised to put your differences aside and help each other out. The universe is trying to remind you that it’s simply not possible to get where you most want to go on your own.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Take extra care when dealing with people whose honesty you cannot be 100 per cent sure of. With Mercury, your ruling planet, under cosmic pressure today you must expect more selfish sorts to try to trick you. Make “Trust no-one’‘your motto.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

Certain individuals can be extremely persuasive, but just because they are good with words does not mean what they have to say is true. The more others weave pretty mental pictures of what they can do for you, the more distance you should put between you.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

Yes, you have problems like everyone else, but in the greater scheme of things you are one of life’s lucky ones, so stop fussing and fretting and find ways to enjoy your good fortune. Your cup is more than half full, in fact it’s very nearly overflowing.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

The more others point out your faults and failings the more likely it is they just want to make you feel bad about yourself. Why? Because they cannot stand the thought that you might be happy while they find it so hard to smile. Misery loves company!

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

Under no circumstances try to bend the facts or be economical with the truth today. Even if you get away with it to begin with you are sure to be found out further down the line, and your reputation will suffer. Don’t give your rivals a free hit.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

Focus on what is positive in your life and ignore those who say you should be panicking like everyone else. You have never been one to let negative emotions dictate what you think, say or do, and there is no reason why you should change now.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

Just because you have had a few short-term losses of late does not mean your long-term outlook is poor. On the contrary, the sun and Mercury in your fellow fire sign of Leo promise great things are on their way, so be patient and prepare yourself.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

You should try to be a bit more tolerant of people whose outlook on life strikes you as wishful thinking at best and deluded at worst. You may be super rational by nature but not everyone can look reality in the face every day as easily as you.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

There is no point trying to please everyone now because almost certainly that means you will end up pleasing no one. Do what feels right to you personally and limit your good deeds, for the time being at least, to those you feel closest to emotionally.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

You know you cannot avoid an unpleasant task, so get on with it now and get it over with before the week gets much older. Be tough with yourself and, where necessary, be tough with those whose mistakes have added another layer to your workload.

Hugo Alvarado: Refugee. Artist. Mentor. Humanitarian. Born July 16, 1948 in Santiago, Chile; died May 23, 2020, while awaiting double lung transplant, in Edmonton; aged 71.

The young man boarding an Air Canada flight in Santiago, Chile, in 1976, spoke no English. Still, he understood when the captain said, “Mr. Alvarado, welcome to Canada,” as other passengers applauded and cheered.

By international law, once aboard a Canadian aircraft, Hugo Alvarado had entered the country. The embassy personnel encircling him for protection could now disperse, and a nun from the convent where Hugo had been hidden for several weeks managed to toss him a bag containing $5 Canadian, clean underwear, toothpaste and a toothbrush.

Three years earlier, Hugo was held with thousands of others in Chile’s national stadium, following the brutal 1973 military coup. Hugo’s work in the Chilean Ministry of Agriculture led to his detention. Tens of thousands were interrogated, tortured, imprisoned and systematically killed. Escaping after three years’ imprisonment, Hugo made it to a Catholic Church. Priests and nuns risked their lives to save his until Canada agreed to accept him as a political refugee.

Upon arrival in Toronto, Hugo was asked where he wanted to go. When he said he knew nothing about Canada, the immigration officer pointed to a map and suggested Hugo pick a spot. Hugo put his finger on what he said looked like “the middle of Canada.”

“That’s Saskatoon,” the officer said.

While Hugo’s selection was by chance, his decision to remain in Saskatoon was by choice. Caring people helped him find work and shelter. He quickly decided this community would be his home and that he would do what he could to help others.

After art classes at the University of Saskatchewan, Hugo became a professional artist at 30, painting vibrant cityscapes and landscapes, still lifes and figures. He sought to use his art to lift up others and started a number of gallery collectives over the years and co-founded the Prairie Sculptors’ Association. He taught adult art classes, encouraging students to find their own style. “There are no prima donnas in my class, including me,” he told them.

Hugo was a passionate, loving and gentle man who wore his heart on his sleeve. He was a master at relating stories, in many of which heartfelt emotion was not far from the surface. The combination of his choking up slightly and heavy Spanish accent could make him difficult to follow, but everyone knew Hugo’s stories always ended with the message: “Do good and be kind.”

He said his parents would be proud of the life and Canadian family he established. A first marriage to Sharon, a fellow student he met while learning English at community college, produced two sons, Ricardo and Jose.

Story continues below advertisement

In the early 1990s, Hugo met Julie at a small gallery where she worked as a picture framer. During their 26 years together, they raised two daughters, Raquel and Paloma.

Hugo always proudly updated friends on the activities of his four children as they established their lives. And his family learned to live with the fact that, immersed in painting, he was often late or missed appointments altogether.

Hugo never stopped creating art or “paying it forward.” He co-founded Artists Against Hunger in 1991, helped raise money for the Saskatoon Crisis Nursery, local theatre and countless community organizations and relief efforts. In recognition of his contributions, he was named CTV Saskatoon’s Citizen of the Year in 2017.

“He never said no when asked for help,” friend Don Greer noted.

Canada’s warm welcome to a refugee made our country richer and stronger.

Eric Cline is Hugo’s friend.

You feel you have a special destiny and that feeling will grow as the year goes on. You are more likely to find out what that destiny is if you make friends with people who share your outlook on life. Together you can make the world a better place.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

Don’t hold back – give life everything you’ve got. There is so much cosmic activity working in your favour that almost anything you do will be a success, so get busy and start climbing your highest mountain, and don’t stop until it’s been conquered.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

Chores may be tedious but the planets indicate that what you have to do this week could in fact be quite exciting, if you approach it from the right angle. Your state of mind is all-important: if you think something is going to be fun then it will be.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

If you are on the move and meeting people this week it will not only be fun in itself but could also take your mind off an issue that has been giving you sleepless nights. Come next weekend the problem will most likely have resolved itself.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

There is more than one way to get what you want, so be flexible and be ready to move in a direction you don’t usually travel if that is the route most likely to take you closest to your goal. Always have a fallback plan, or several.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

The sun in your sign means you are very much at the centre of things now, and no doubt your ego will be swollen by all the compliments that come your way. Don’t believe them all though – some people will say anything to gain your approval.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

If someone in a position of authority gives you a hard time this week then you must give them an equally hard time back. The planets warn if you stand there and take it they will be encouraged to pick on you again. Don’t let that happen.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

Why wait for life to come to you when by getting out there and setting the agenda you can make things happen the way you want them to happen? The planets urge you to think nothing but positive thoughts – then surely your dreams will come true.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

Are you reluctant to accept some kind of promotion because you fear you are not up to the job? if so, you should remind yourself of all the times in the past when you feared getting it wrong but ended up doing it better than everyone else.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

Because so many of your opinions are at odds with the way most people think you are sure to attract disapproval, but no one can stop you believing what your sixth sense tells you is true. Speak up and spread your valuable message far and wide.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

If friends and relatives seem unable to make up their minds about what you should be doing, then just do what feels right to you. Most likely they will follow your lead and have a surprisingly good time. They may even thank you for it.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

You’ve been a bit too cautious in recent weeks and now you need to go right the other way and take a few risks. So long as they are calculated risks, as opposed to stupid ones, you stand every chance of ending the week ahead of the game.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

Avoid other people’s petty squabbles this week, especially if you don’t know all the facts. The more they try to draw you in and get you involved the more distance you must put between them and you. It’s not your fight, so stay out of it.

In early April, about a month into the COVID-19 lockdown, Daniel Rotsztain, an artist, writer and cartographer living in Toronto, built what he calls a “social distance machine.” Imagine a giant hula hoop, jutting two metres in all directions, worn around the neck like an Elizabethan collar, minus the Shakespearean ruffles.

As Rotsztain filmed, his friend Bobby Gadda donned the contraption and tried to walk around downtown streets, sidewalks and parks. Invariably, his device bumped into just about everything – people, construction hoarding, the sides of buildings. Absurd? A little. But the resulting YouTube video, viewed nearly 385,000 times, illustrated an important point. “We were being told to stay two metres from other people,” Rotsztain says. “Often, that involved stepping into the road, into a live lane of traffic. That’s not safe.”

Canada’s cities, with their narrow sidewalks and car-clogged roads, were simply not designed for physical distancing. As COVID-19 continues to force us apart, designers are looking for ways to rethink the spaces and places where we live with wellness in mind. But not just with new bike lanes and car-free roads (both of which increased in Toronto after Rotsztain made his video): The inside of our homes, parks and playgrounds are also getting a health-focused rethink.

“Extreme situations sometimes bring about innovation,” says Maya Mahgoub-Desai, senior urban designer for Moriyama Teshima Architects and chair of the environmental design program at the Ontario College of Art & Design University. “I recommend a book called The Ghost Map. It basically details how our modern sanitary sewer systems emerged from a tragic cholera outbreak. Public infrastructure can be used to mitigate public health crises.”

If cholera led to the invention of the modern sewage system and, by extension, the toilets that link into it, COVID-19 might lead many North Americans to finally embrace bidets. California-based bidet-maker Brondell has seen a 300-per-cent jump in interest since March. Many clients of Toronto interior designer Nora Voon have been asking for them, freaked out by the prospect of toilet paper shortages. “Copper handles, faucets and fixtures are particularly popular,” says Voon, adding that copper is naturally anti-microbial, killing viruses, including COVID-19, faster than other metals, plastics and glass.

Beyond bidets, Voon, founder and principal of Noda Designs, says “a lot will change” in our homes as a result of COVID-19. Some of the shifts will be small, yet practical. Pantries might get larger, to cut down on the need for extraneous grocery runs. Extra bathrooms can help if someone in a house becomes infected, making in-home distancing easier. “People want more sinks in general,” Voon says. “There’s increased attention to handwashing. I’m being asked for sinks in mud rooms, so people can scrub down as soon as they come home. I was never asked for that before.”

Outdoors, the concept of the Victory Garden is making a comeback. The idea throws back to the Second World War, when Canadians grew their own backyard produce so the gas and oil used by farms could instead by sent to the front. According to Martha Kantorczyk, a member of the Mississauga Master Gardeners, an association whose mandate is to give free, useful advice to amateur green thumbs, one of the upsides is that space needn’t be a constraint.

“You can grow just about anything in container planters and hanging baskets on a condo patio,” she says. And it’s not too late for vegetables. Whereas tomatoes, peas and cucumbers are typically planted in early spring, “there are fall vegetables that can be started inside now and moved out as the weather gets cooler. Kale, for example, does really well in colder weather.”

For homeowners with lots of space and big budgets, Voon is planning elaborate garden revamps, including outdoor kitchens and alfresco living and dining set-ups. “Swimming pools are becoming more popular,” she says. “People are looking for ways to entertain themselves and friends outside, while keeping a distance. The trend used to be to bringing the outside in. Now, it’s bringing the inside out.”

Some designers are trying to facilitate such backyard hangs with extreme precaution. Multinational architecture studio Scott Brownrigg, based in England, has designed something called the Social Contact Pod. It’s basically a prefab box that can be trucked to someone’s lawn and set up in a day. It works a bit like a prison visitation room, albeit a fancy one, lined with big windows and blond woods. Each party enters through separate doors and are kept apart by a plexiglass divider, ensuring no one shares the same surfaces, let alone the same air.

If space is tight, the thought of gathering in a public park might be tempting, although it can also be anxiety inducing. It is hard to know, just by eye, whether friends and family are keeping their two-metre distance. Some municipalities have tried to help by painting circles, six feet apart, on park lawns. For where that doesn’t exist, London-based designer Paul Cocksedge has released something called Here Comes the Sun. It’s a free DIY pattern, downloadable through his website, for a picnic blanket that marks out exactly where to sit to stay six feet from others. It’s like the anti-Twister board, with spread out dots.

Equally daunting while in a park: where to go to the washroom. Many public toilets are locked for the foreseeable future. A Dutch company called, fittingly, Lapee, has invented a moveable, outdoor urinal – specifically for women. The pavilions could easily be mistaken for a swirling, pink Richard Serra sculpture, all folding, overlapping walls. There are no doors. Women need only walk in, squat over an ergonomically positioned receptacle and clean their hands with built-in bottles of sanitizer.

Among the more upsetting signs that COVID-19 has disrupted modern life, especially the lives of children, is the site of yellow caution tape draped across so many playgrounds. “I can only imagine how distressing that is to a child,” says Nathan Schleicher, a playground designer at Ontario’s Earthscape Play. “I respect the need for quarantine. I also know that kids need to play, and to play with each other.”

Two German designers, Martin Binder and psychologist Claudio Rimmele, have envisioned a playground that keeps children at least two metres apart, separated in shallow, lily-pad-shaped platforms, each with their own individual entrances. Some activities span pad-to-pad, such as see-saws; others are solo, such as sandboxes connected by a network of speaking tubes (like cans on a string, but nicer looking) to encourage conversation, if not direct contract, during play.

Schleicher has a simpler suggestion: Build more playgrounds to help prevent overcrowding, and follow public-health recommendations for cleaning shared equipment. “Many playgrounds will be worth going back to after the pandemic,” he says. “They don’t all need to be redesigned. We may just need added protocols to keep them safe.”

Mahgoub-Desai points out that there are lots of underutilized spaces in our cities that could be turned into additional parkettes and small play spaces. “Because of the pandemic, we’ve seen parents bring their kids to bike around parking lots,” she says. “There’s no reason those spaces can’t also be beautiful, can’t also have this wonderful, extra purpose to them.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prorogued Parliament Tuesday, saying he needs a Throne Speech to launch a new recovery plan and insisting the move is consistent with his party’s pledge not to misuse the procedural move.

Mr. Trudeau made the announcement the same day that he named Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland as the new Finance Minister, a position vacated Monday by the resignation of Bill Morneau. She is the country’s first woman in that role.

In proroguing Parliament until Sept. 23, Mr. Trudeau shuts down committee investigations into the Liberal government’s WE Charity controversy. The Prime Minister promised a Throne Speech when Parliament returns and a confidence vote, which could trigger a federal election if the minority government Liberals fail to win the support of at least one of the three main opposition parties.

The Prime Minister said prorogation and a Throne Speech are necessary because the world has changed since the government approved its initial Throne Speech in December, which was based on the Liberal Party’s 2019 campaign pledges.

Background: For Chrystia Freeland, the political is personal

Freeland’s appointment completes the centralization of power in Trudeau’s office

Freeland just inherited the hardest job in Canada. How long can she keep it?

“We do not want an election. But it is obvious that the Throne Speech we gave eight months ago is no longer relevant for the reality that Canadians are living and that our government is facing,” Mr. Trudeau told reporters at a news conference on Parliament Hill. “There are many things we committed to Canadians in that Throne Speech that we will be continuing to work on, but many others that aren’t the priority that they once were. ... I think it is important that Canadians have a clear idea of the plan that we have for building a stronger economy that is more inclusive, that is greener, that is fairer for all Canadians.”

The Liberal Party’s 2015 election campaign platform included a specific pledge not to abuse the use of prorogation, after criticizing the former Conservative prime minister’s use of the procedural tool.

“We will not resort to legislative tricks to avoid scrutiny,” the platform said. “Stephen Harper has used prorogation to prevent Parliament from properly reviewing and debating his proposals.” The platform said House of Commons rules would be changed “to bring an end to this undemocratic process.”

Mr. Harper faced criticism for proroguing Parliament in December, 2008, during the onset of the global financial crisis, at a time when opposition parties were planning to defeat his minority Conservative government. The prorogation bought the government time and allowed it to survive confidence votes when Parliament resumed the next month. Mr. Harper’s third of four prorogations in power was also controversial. The December, 2009, prorogation had the effect of shutting down a politically sensitive parliamentary investigation into the government’s handling of Afghan detainees.

During the Trudeau government’s first four-year term, Parliament was never prorogued.

When asked about that campaign pledge, Mr. Trudeau insisted the current situation is different.

“Stephen Harper and the Conservatives prorogued Parliament in order to shut it down and avoid a confidence vote. We are proroguing Parliament to bring it back on exactly the same week it was supposed to come back anyway and force a confidence vote,” he said.

The House of Commons was scheduled to sit for one day next week as part of an agreement with the NDP earlier in the year to continue the suspension of regular sitting days while allowing some committee work to continue. There have only been 45 regular sitting days since the October, 2019, election because of suspensions related to the novel coronavirus.

Regular sitting days were scheduled to resume on Monday, Sept. 21. Mr. Trudeau could have decided to allow committee work to continue and to prorogue just before the Throne Speech, rather than immediately.

The effect of prorogation is that regular committee work is shut down as all bills and committee studies die.

The existing bills and committee studies are not necessarily ended for good, however. Procedural options exist for MPs to approve motions that would reinstate bills and studies back to the stages they were at at the time of prorogation.

Mr. Trudeau said that documents related to the now-cancelled contract with the WE Charity designed to help students during the pandemic would still be released.

“I can say that we have released all those documents to the members of the committee so that they can spend their time going through those mountains of documents over the coming weeks so that they can continue to ask any questions they like on this issue,” he said.

Opposition MPs on the House of Commons finance committee have received an estimated 5,000 pages of documents.

At the time of the Speech from the Throne, a new Conservative leader will be in place. A leader is to be named on Sunday and will have to hit the ground running in preparation for a possible election.

The decision to prorogue Parliament was met with disdain from opposition parties on Tuesday.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the prorogation is aimed at blocking the WE Charity investigation.

“Earlier this year, Justin Trudeau shamefully shut down Parliament to try and avoid accountability. Now he has locked out opposition MPs who were working hard to fix his government’s pandemic programs [and] help Canadians and get to the bottom of his corruption scandal,” he said in a statement. “Justin Trudeau is walking out on Canadians in the middle of a major health and economic crisis, in a disgusting attempt to make Canadians forget about his corruption.”

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said shutting down Parliament in the middle of a pandemic and an economic crisis is wrong.

“Canadians shouldn’t be forced to pay the price for Mr. Trudeau’s scandals,” he said on Twitter.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Singh told reporters in Vancouver that this week’s events are “deeply troubling” and a sign that the Liberals are more focused on themselves rather than dealing with the pandemic.

“It seems like the Liberal government is more interested in throwing the finance minister under the bus than the Prime Minister taking responsibility for his own breaches of conflict-of-interest laws and his own breaches when it comes to scandals,” Mr. Singh said.

Prior to Mr. Trudeau’s prorogation announcement, he was at Rideau Hall for a ceremony to swear in Ms. Freeland to the critical finance portfolio.

On Monday, Bill Morneau, who had served in the role since 2015, announced he was leaving the Trudeau cabinet. Mr. Morneau is also resigning as an MP. The resignation followed several media reports of disagreements between the two men, but both praised each other in their public comments this week.

Both are the subject of investigations by the Ethics Commissioner related to a now-cancelled contract with WE Charity to administer a program for students during the pandemic.

The Ethics Commissioner will proceed with his report on Mr. Morneau even if he is no longer an office holder, his office confirmed on Tuesday.

At a committee hearing into the issue last month, Mr. Morneau revealed that he had reimbursed $41,366 to WE Charity for travel expenses that the group covered for personal trips his family took to Kenya and Ecuador in 2017.

He is the only finance minister that Mr. Trudeau has had since his government came to power in 2015.

Mr. Trudeau thanked Mr. Morneau for his service, adding that he counted on the minister’s leadership, advice and close friendship over the years.

The swearing-in of the new cabinet was the first of its kind during the pandemic. Those attending the ceremony wore masks, and chairs at the ceremony were spaced out to enable physical distancing.

Ms. Freeland, who was first elected in 2013, will be the first female finance minister in Canadian history, and she is regarded in Liberal circles as a good listener, strong communicator and as being able to take on significant undertakings for the government.

From 2015 to 2017, Ms. Freeland served as the international trade minister and oversaw the renegotiation of Canada’s free trade agreement with the European Union.

From January, 2017, to November, 2019, she held the Foreign Affairs portfolio and concluded the renegotiation of the North American free-trade agreement between Canada, Mexico and the United States.

Ms. Freeland is also a former journalist and author.

She expressed hope that her appointment will inspire other women and signalled that her focus is on crafting an economic recovery plan that includes a strong environmental focus and addresses the fact that the economic impact of the pandemic “is hitting women particularly hard.”

“I am conscious of the fact that I am Canada’s first woman Finance Minister,” she said. “It’s about time that we broke that glass ceiling. I’d like to say to all the Canadian women across our amazing country who are out there breaking glass ceilings: Keep going.”

Representing Canada during trade talks with the United States involved regular discussions with provincial and territorial premiers, who must approve aspects of any trade deals that fall under their jurisdiction.

As Deputy Prime Minister, the Alberta-born Ms. Freeland was assigned to keep working closely with the provinces on a range of issues including sensitive such as energy policy. That role increased substantially at the onset of the pandemic, as she was placed in charge of a special COVID-19 cabinet committee and was Ottawa’s main contact with the premiers to co-ordinate Canada’s pandemic response plan.

Ms. Freeland negotiated with the provinces on a federal pandemic support package, which increased from an initial offer of $14-billion to $19-billion when it was finalized in July.

“It’s very likely that all the premiers would share the perspective that Minister Freeland, in her previous roles, whether it was COVID or prior to that with trade discussions, was very willing to reach out to the premiers, me included,” Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister told The Globe and Mail Tuesday.

“I appreciated that dialogue and I think that’s going to be essential moving forward.”

Mr. Pallister said “of course I’m concerned” about the instability in Ottawa as the finance minister is replaced in the middle of a pandemic, but praised the fact that Mr. Morneau’s replacement was announced quickly.

Another Progressive Conservative Premier also had high praise for Ms. Freeland and her appointment as Finance Minister.

“There’s no secret, I think the world of Chrystia,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford told reporters at an event in Scarborough that included a call for more federal funding for public transit.

“I sent her a message this morning. She was strong as Deputy Prime Minister, and if there is one person I have confidence in, it’s Chrystia Freeland, that we can work together, we can sit down, pick up the phone. And one of the first phone calls – I’ll let her get settled in – but we need money for the transit system,” he said. “There’s no better person I’d want to work with than Chrystia Freeland. She’s going to do an incredible job. She’s a good friend and I can’t wait to start working with her to move our projects forward.”

Jerry Dias, the president of Unifor, said Tuesday that he worked hand-in-hand with Ms. Freeland during the renegotiation of the new U.S. free-trade agreement. Mr. Dias said she will bring a broad understanding of people to her new role as Finance Minister.

“She is deeply principled ... I watched her dealing with the United States, I watched her dealing with [U.S. President Donald] Trump on the softwood lumber dispute. I watched her deal with the aluminum tariffs during the [free-trade] debate,” he said. “I know her. I respect her.”

Members of Parliament were warned Monday that an insufficient response from Canada and its allies to the crisis in Hong Kong could embolden the Chinese Communist government in Beijing to one day move against the self-ruled island of Taiwan.

“I remain very concerned that Beijing could draw the wrong conclusions about the international community’s response to Hong Kong, which over time could lead it to extend such an approach to Taiwan,” Evan Medeiros, an American scholar who served on the National Security Council in Barack Obama’s administration, told the Commons Canada-China committee.

“The U.S., Canada and other governments should work in co-ordination to take actions that disabuse Beijing from the belief that it could extend its coercion to Taiwan.”

The Commons committee on Canada-China relations has been holding hearings on Beijing’s crackdown in Hong Kong, where 300,000 Canadian citizens live.

A new national security law imposed by the Chinese Communist Party on the former British colony has chilled political freedoms by creating a cadre of secret police to enforce new vaguely defined offences that carry punishments as harsh as life in prison.

Prof. Medeiros, an expert in Asian studies at Georgetown University, cautioned MPs that he did not regard Beijing’s crackdown on Hong Kong as a prelude to military action against Taiwan. But, he said, China will certainly be taking inventory of how much blowback it received for restricting political freedoms in Hong Kong.

He said he’s concerned that “if there is insufficient solidarity in the West about the situation in Hong Kong, then in the future, if the situation deteriorates over Taiwan, Beijing could come to the conclusion that the costs were worth bearing – that they were really weren’t that high. And that American and Canada and U.K. and Australia would eventually get over it.”

China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under Beijing’s control, though most people in Taiwan have shown no interest in being ruled by China. In January, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said: “The unification of the two sides of the strait is a historical inevitability,” according to state-run Xinhua News.

Aside from suspending an extradition treaty with Hong Kong, and ending shipments of certain military goods to the territory, Canada’s response to the deteriorating rights situation there has included two joint statements with the U.S., Britain and Australia and one with the Group of Seven. There have been no requests for Canada to extradite people to Hong Kong over the past five years.

Prof. Madeiros advised Canada to broaden future statements to include Japan, South Korea and European Union countries. And to take co-ordinated action with the U.S. to “signal there are costs for its crackdown.”

MPs were urged to slap targeted sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials responsible for human-rights abuses in the former British colony by using the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act, known as the Sergei Magnitsky Law. The U.S. earlier this month imposed sanctions on Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, and 10 others.

Witnesses urged the committee not to enact broad sanctions measures that would hurt Hong Kong’s economy. Sharon Hom, executive director of Human Rights in China, a Chinese non-governmental organization founded by overseas Chinese students and scientists, urged Canadian authorities to consult databases created by Hong Kong support groups.

“When it comes to sanctions, implement them like laser surgery – not hitting them over the head with a baseball bat,” she said.

“Threatening [sanctions] is not enough. You have to follow through,” she told MPs.

Canadian MPs were reminded of how Canada and the United States and other Western allies said little or nothing when warning signs arose in Hong Kong years ago.

China had pledged in a 1984 treaty with Britain – the Sino-British declaration – that it would allow Western-style freedoms including freedom of the press, assembly and speech to continue to flourish in Hong Kong for 50 years after the former colony was relinquished by the British.

Alvin Cheung, a scholar at New York University’s U.S.-Asia Law Institute, noted however that in 2014, China declared that the Sino-British declaration no longer had any meaning. A Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman in 2017 told journalists that it was now only “a historical document, [and] no longer has any practical significance, and it is not at all binding” on Beijing.

“The failure of the international community – Canada included – to condemn these repudiations has contributed to the climate of impunity under which the People’s Republic of China now operates in Hong Kong,” Mr. Cheung said.

Conservative MP Garnett Genuis, a member of the committee, said: “the defining question for the upcoming committee report on Hong Kong will likely be whether or not to recommend the use of Magnitsky sanctions ... Without real consequences, Chinese state aggression will continue to grow.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is meeting with Bill Morneau on Monday amid questions about the extent of the federal government’s pandemic spending and the Finance Minister’s political fate.

The Prime Minister and Mr. Morneau are scheduled to meet in a bid to sort out their differences, Reuters news agency reported Sunday, citing sources who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.

The Monday meeting was reported first by Bloomberg.

Mr. Morneau’s office declined to confirm to The Globe and Mail that the discussion was to take place and it did not answer when asked about the Finance Minister’s relationship with the Prime Minister.

The Prime Minister’s Office also did not respond to requests to comment on Monday’s meeting.

The meeting marks a high-stakes moment for Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Morneau, who has served in his portfolio since 2015.

Two sources told The Globe on Sunday that the PMO has been going around the Finance Department to consult private-sector economists on what levels of government spending and deficit are tolerable to credit rating agencies.

On Tuesday, The Globe reported that sources said Mr. Trudeau is not committed to keeping Mr. Morneau on as the key architect of the federal government’s economic revival plan after the two clashed over the Finance Department’s policy responses to the COVID-19 crisis.

Mr. Trudeau was uncertain whether Mr. Morneau was the right fit to steer the country into a postpandemic economic recovery, insiders said.

The Globe and Mail did not identify the sources because they were not authorized to speak publicly about Mr. Trudeau’s plans for a cabinet remake that could lead to the departure of Mr. Morneau.

Story continues below advertisement

The PMO issued a statement after The Globe report that said Mr. Trudeau had full confidence in his finance minister.

In July, the Prime Minister’s Office was caught off guard when Mr. Morneau revealed he recently repaid $41,366 to WE Charity for expenses incurred on trips his family took with the organization to Kenya and Ecuador three years ago.

In testimony before a parliamentary committee, Mr. Morneau said his wife and daughter travelled to Kenya in the summer of 2017 to learn about WE school projects and that, later that year, he travelled to Ecuador with his family to see and participate in WE’s humanitarian work in that country.

The Ethics Commissioner is now investigating Mr. Morneau and Mr. Trudeau over whether they breached the Conflict of Interest Act. The probes stem from a now-cancelled contribution agreement of $543.5-million with the charity that has been the subject of much angst this summer for the Liberal government.

Nik Nanos, the founder and chief data scientist of Nanos Research, said in an interview that the minister of finance is usually one of the most powerful cabinet ministers sitting around the table and that whenever there is a disagreement between the minister and the prime minister it is “never good.”

Mr. Nanos also said the WE controversy had a significant negative impact on Liberal Party support. But he noted that weekly tracking by his firm is showing that the impact has been abated following the testimony of the Prime Minister and his chief-of-staff, Katie Telford, before a parliamentary committee.

Story continues below advertisement

“That was the key pivotal moment for the Liberals when they started to staunch the bleeding of support,” Mr. Nanos said.

Mr. Trudeau told the House of Commons finance committee on July 30 that WE Charity got “no preferential treatment” and he “pushed back” when he heard of the idea of the charity administering the program because he wanted to make sure the public service was ready to fully justify the choice.

Mr. Trudeau has also apologized for not recusing himself from cabinet discussions on the contribution agreement with the charity despite his family connections to the charity.

His wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, is an ambassador for the organization and his mother and brother have both been paid for speaking engagements.

WE Charity has said that since 2016, the Prime Minister’s mother, Margaret Trudeau, has been paid about $312,000 in speaking fees and his brother, Alexandre Trudeau, received about $40,000. Ms. Grégoire Trudeau was paid $1,400 for one appearance, at an event in 2012.

Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre said Sunday the Prime Minister would have fired Mr. Morneau weeks ago for accepting the trip from the charity but said the problem has been that Mr. Trudeau would have to fire himself for his own ethical lapses.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Poilievre predicted Mr. Trudeau’s team would make a “forthcoming firing” of Mr. Morneau about a policy fight when there is no such row.

NDP ethics critic Charlie Angus said Sunday the Liberal government will be rocked by two damning reports from the Ethics Commissioner once released.

“They [PMO] have been sending signals ever since Morneau forgot about the $41,000 in flights, that they’re not happy with them, that there’s problems,” he said. “I think it’s that they know they can’t continue with Morneau.”

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is calling on Ottawa to provide the provinces with billions in funding for child care – a demand that could help determine whether the minority Liberal government survives.

With the support of the Liberals, the NDP passed a motion this week calling on the federal government to immediately transfer $2 billion to the provinces for child care.

Singh is now upping the ante, calling for another $10 billion over the next four years.

Singh says $2 billion is needed this year just to ensure there are enough child-care spaces available to allow parents – particularly mothers – to go back to work now that restrictions to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic are being relaxed.

He says another $10 billion over the next four years is necessary to ensure universal, affordable, accessible child care for all.

With the Bloc Quebecois threatening to bring down the Liberal government this fall, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau can’t afford to dismiss the demands of New Democrats, whose support could be the key to avoiding defeat on a confidence motion.

“The federal government must acknowledge that if we want a recovery, we need to make sure women can get back to work and that means assuring that there’s affordable and accessible child care,” Singh told a news conference Friday in Victoria, B.C.

He noted the Liberals have been promising to bring in universal child care for more than 20 years.

“Now we want to see action. It’s not enough to say the words. We need to see Prime Minister Trudeau and the Liberal government back it up.”

The Liberals, with 156 seats, are 14 votes shy of a majority in the House of Commons. Support from the NDP’s 24 MPs would ensure the government’s survival should the Bloc, Conservatives, Greens and Independent MPs join forces to bring it down.

Singh did not frame his call for child-care funding Friday as a condition for NDP support.

In a written statement later to The Canadian Press, he said: “This isn’t about us or our support. This is about the government earning the confidence of people across this country.

“They do that by keeping their promises, by working with us to fix (employment insurance) permanently so people get the help they need, and by standing by their support of our call for an immediate investment in child care so parents can go back to work knowing their kids are safe at school or at child care.”

Among the NDP’s priorities is ensuring that employment insurance is expanded sufficiently to ensure no jobless Canadian is left in the cold once the last eligibility period for the $2,000-per-month Canada Emergency Response Benefit ends on Sept. 26. The government has promised a “seamless transition” back to employment insurance that leaves no one behind but has yet to reveal its plan for doing that.

A recent analysis from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives shows that of the 4.7 million Canadians receiving the CERB as of Aug. 2, 2.9 million would get less benefits or nothing at all under the existing employment insurance system.

Moreover, it said women account for 57 per cent of the CERB recipients who are at risk of being ineligible for employment insurance.

It’s not clear that the Conservatives, who have been the most vociferous critics of the Liberal government, would back a Bloc motion of non-confidence.

But New Democrats are relishing the possibility that they’ll be able to drive the agenda this fall as the Liberals’ only significant dance partner.

Back in 2005, the NDP forced Paul Martin’s minority Liberal government to boost social spending by $4.6 billion over two years in return for supporting that year’s budget.

WE Charity told federal MPs it had registered Thursday with the federal lobbying registry, months after receiving a $543.5-million contract to run the government’s student grant program.

Dalal Al-Waheidi, the executive director of WE Charity, told the House of Commons finance committee that the organization did not register previously because it didn’t think it was necessary under lobbying rules.

“If I thought that registration was required, we would have done it,” Ms. Al-Waheidi told members of Parliament.

Ms. Al-Waheidi testified on the same day that WE announced it was cutting 67 full-time and contract staff in Toronto and closing its office in London, putting another 19 employees out of work.

She testified alongside Scott Baker, chief operations officer of WE Charity, and Sofia Marquez, who previously worked as WE Charity’s director of government and stakeholder relations.

MPs questioned Ms. Marquez about her lobbying efforts and why she didn’t register. Lobbying rules require corporations to register when the cumulative lobbying activities of all employees adds up to a “significant part of duties,” which has been defined as the equivalent of 20 per cent or more of the working hours of one full-time employee, over a one-month period.

Prime Minister Trudeau and WE Charity: The controversy explained

Ms. Marquez said the time she spent lobbying different levels of government “varied” and that she is not able to provide MPs with a percentage of how much time she spent lobbying.

Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre questioned Ms. Marquez about her communication with the Prime Minister’s Office and Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s office. Ms. Marquez said she has communicated with staff in Mr. Morneau’s office and e-mailed a staffer in the PMO. She also had a half-hour phone call with a policy director in the PMO on May 5 about the “current state of the proposal.” Ms. Marquez said she was also on a phone call with Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth Bardish Chagger and WE co-founder Craig Kielburger.

The contract was signed on June 23 but came into effect on May 5, 2020. WE has said the May 5 date reflects when it began working on the project and incurring eligible expenditures to design, build and prepare to deliver the program. However, cabinet’s final decision was made more than two weeks later.

Mr. Poilievre asked Ms. Marquez repeatedly whether the PMO said WE could begin implementing the program, given May 5 is the date WE began its work. She said she was not aware of the contract being implemented and her conversation was not about the project’s implementation.

“Well it’s an incredible coincidence that WE, that your organization, has suddenly registered to lobby all of these months after all of the lobbying happened,” Mr. Poilievre said.

In its filing to the federal lobbyist registry, WE Charity disclosed 65 communications with federal officials or ministers in 19 different departments or federal institutions, dating as far back as January, 2019. It lists 18 individuals, including Ms. Al-Waheidi, as in-house lobbyists for the organization. Craig and Marc Kielburger, the brothers who founded WE Charity, are not listed even though they have talked to ministers.

Opposition parties last month asked lobbying commissioner Nancy Bélanger to investigate whether WE Charity violated the Lobbying Act.

Members of Parliament questioned the three committee witnesses Thursday about who in government gave WE the green light to implement the program. No one provided a name, and Mr. Baker said the organization never felt it had the green light, but understood that to deliver the program, it had to build it in May and June.

WE has been embroiled in controversy over a $543.5-million federal volunteer program called the Canada Student Services Grant. The government gave WE a contract to administer the program, which included up to $43.5-million to cover expenses. The agreement was cancelled on July 3 amid conflict-of-interest allegations involving Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose family members have been paid to speak at WE events. Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Morneau have both apologized for not recusing themselves from the decision around WE. The charity received $30-million in expenses and has promised to pay back the full amount although $8-million remains outstanding.

The controversy erupted amid a pandemic that has dried up donations and forced the charity to lay off more than 200 workers in March. The layoffs caused dissension among WE’s board of directors and led to the resignation of chair Michelle Douglas, who said she and other members quit in late March over concerns about the lack of financial transparency.

Ms. Al-Waheidi told the committee Thursday that the combination of the pandemic and the controversy had been devastating and forced WE to scale back.

WE plans to keep its 43,000 square-foot Toronto headquarters, called the Global Learning Centre, but Ms. Al-Waheidi said in a statement it is “actively assessing which real estate holdings could be sold.” That includes buildings in Toronto that were supposed to be used to provide free space for not-for-profit social enterprises.

WE holds roughly $40-million worth of property in Canada, which includes around 10 buildings in Toronto. The organization has already cancelled all WE Day events, the organization’s annual celebration of volunteers, and suspended partnerships with most corporate sponsors. It is also assessing all of its operations.

Britain had been a major centre for WE and the group has had a separate British charity for 10 years.

Ms. Al-Waheidi said that while WE’s British operations will be centralized in Toronto, the organization will continue to have a registered charity in Britain overseen by a British board of directors. That arrangement will be reviewed in a year, she added.

The Globe has a sponsorship partnership with WE Charity. The agreement expires on Aug. 31 and will not be renewed.

A new cadre of “secret police” empowered by the June 30 law can arrest Canadians living in Hong Kong, witnesses told MPs on the House of Commons Special Committee on Canada-China Relations.

The Beijing-drafted national security law makes what China broadly defines as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces punishable by as much as life in prison.

Canada condemns arrest of Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai as erosion of press freedom

The MPs were also cautioned that any member of the committee – or any Canadian – could be charged under the new law, which is worldwide in scope. China has extradition agreements with more than 35 countries.

Witnesses included Samuel Chu, a U.S. activist who was charged under the new law even though he lives in the United States. Chinese state media reported last last month that arrest warrants had been issued for him and five other overseas pro-democracy activists, including Nathan Law, who has fled Hong Kong for London.

“Every provision of the national security law applies to everyone outside of Hong Kong,” Mr. Chu told the committee, which is holding hearings on the law.

“Nobody is beyond its reach; not me, an American living on U.S. soil, and not the 300,000 Canadians living and working in Hong Kong itself.”

Mr. Chu noted that several Hong Kongers have been charged under the law in connection with posts they made on social media.

He said he now must avoid countries that have extradition treaties with China or even just friendly relations. And he must prevent family members being drawn into this.

“I cannot speak to my elderly parents in Hong Kong without opening them up, or subjecting them, to investigation and invasive searches by the police,” he said.

Michael Davis, a former law professor at the University of Hong Kong, told the MPs Article 38 of the new legislation says the law applies not only in Hong Kong but to offences “committed outside the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ... by a person who is not a permanent resident of the region.”

He told MPs that merely talking in hearings with a witness who calls for sanctions against Hong Kong, for instance – or, as the law says “provokes ... hatred” towards the Chinese government – is grounds for charges.

“Unfortunately, this committee could also be tarred with that,” said Prof. Davis, who is a global fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington and a senior research scholar with the Weatherhead East Asian Institute at Columbia University.

“If we actually advocate sanctions at this moment, we could be charged under the law regardless of the fact we are exercising our freedom of expression.”

Prof. Davis said the law empowers officials from China’s state security and public security bureaus – whom he called “secret police” -- to operate in Hong Kong and seize suspects.

“Under this new law .. if these security officials from the mainland want to, they can take you, render you, to the mainland for trial. So Hong Kongers or foreigners in Hong Kong, including Canadians, if they are arrested under this law, and the mainland officials decide they want to bring you to China, they can do so.”

Annie Boyajian, director of advocacy at Freedom House, a U.S.-based rights watchdog, warned MPs that the new freedom for Chinese security officials could mean that some of the 300,000 Canadians in Hong Kong may fall victim to politically motivated arrests more common in mainland China. While most Canadians know of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, who were incarcerated in China in apparent act of retaliation, other cases are not as high-profile.

“Perhaps less well-known is the case of Sun Qian, a Canadian citizen and businesswoman just sentenced in Beijing to eight years in prison for being a Falun Gong practitioner. It is possible these types of arrests could also occur in Hong Kong,” Ms. Boyajian said.

She and Benedict Rogers, a human rights activist who is co-founder and chair of Hong Kong Watch, told MPs that Canadians, particularly those with ties to dissidents, could be stopped from leaving Hong Kong. Authorities have already threatened not to recognize passport documents the U.K. is giving to residents.

“There is certainly a risk that China will threaten to do this, which is why Canada should move quickly to help people while they are still able to leave,” Mr. Rogers said.

Asked if it’s planning to evacuate or repatriate Canadians who live in Hong Kong, a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said the government is prepared to help citizens return home.

“When it comes to the estimated 300,000 Canadians who reside in Hong Kong, the government will continue to provide consular assistance, and stands ready to help any Canadians who wish to return do so,” press secretary Syrine Khoury said in an e-mailed statement.

Her comments come after police launched an investigation this week into an incident at her constituency office, as well as reports that two other Ottawa-area politicians also faced threats recently.

Ms. McKenna, who has spoken out in the past about being a target, said she’s heard from many politicians who have experienced similar incidents, some never reported publicly.

“It’s not just about me. There’s been some attention to incidents involving me, but I’ve heard from so many women, from so many men, and it’s really worrying,” she said after a funding announcement in Ottawa.

“We need to reflect on this and take action so we can all do our jobs.”

Earlier this week, a police investigation was launched after someone yelled obscenities at a member of Ms. McKenna’s staff, with the footage posted to social media.

After being told the constituency office in downtown Ottawa was closed owing to COVID-19, the individual yelled expletives and insults at the employee about Ms. McKenna and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

In the aftermath of the 2019 election, vulgar and sexist graffiti had been spray-painted across the front of her campaign office.

During that campaign, she had also spoken to The Canadian Press about how what had started as anonymous online abuse had escalated into in-person verbal assaults, sometimes requiring her to have a security detail. That level of protection is not usually provided to cabinet ministers.

According to data from the RCMP, first reported by the Toronto Star, there has been an increase in the number of threats made against the prime minister and cabinet when compared to last year.

Story continues below advertisement

The RCMP say from January to July, 2019, protective policing opened 100 investigations into threats, while from January to July, 2020, there have been approximately 130 launched.

Following the incident at Ms. McKenna’s office, Lisa MacLeod, a member of the Ontario legislature for an Ottawa riding and provincial cabinet minister, gave an interview on local radio condemning the abuse.

She then received threats of her own, her spokesman confirmed Thursday.

“Minister MacLeod is once again receiving police protection due to both threatening emails and an unexplained mischievous incident to her personal vehicle in Ottawa,” Derek Rowland said in an email.

In March, 2019, a woman was charged with making threats against Ms. MacLeod, and she was given a police detail, during controversy around changes to the province’s autism strategy. She was in charge of that file at the time.

Last week, Laura Dudas, an Ottawa city councillor, had a rock hurled through a window of her home while her family was asleep.

“While I cannot speak to the motivations of the person behind this disturbing act, it comes as the latest in a string of acts targeting my role as a woman in politics,” she said in a statement posted to social media Thursday.

“There are too many reports of women politicians being the recipients of vicious online abuse, derogatory comments about their gender, and when online vitriol spills into the real world, violent physical attacks. This has to stop.”

Federal Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau, the first woman to ever hold that post, said while she’s never received threats at the same level as McKenna, she has been subject to negative comments online.

She said while she doesn’t physically fear for her own safety, she thinks a light has to be shone on how much abuse is heaped upon politicians.

What’s happening to McKenna though, she said, is both inexplicable and unacceptable.

“How can we still have this type of behaviour in 2020? I don’t get it,” she said.

More than 12 million eggs will be redistributed via an emergency federal program designed to help farmers faced with too much food and nowhere to sell it due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau announced Thursday that the government has signed eight agreements worth nearly $50-million to help align the needs of food banks and other community groups with what farmers and producers can supply.

In an interview with The Canadian Press, Bibeau called the program a “win-win-win.”

Story continues below advertisement

“It’s reaching three objectives,” she said.

“The first one to feed the people in need, second to support our farmers by buying some of their surplus at the cost of production and the third one was avoiding food waste.”

The organizations receiving the money include Food Banks Canada, Second Harvest and the Quebec group La Tablee des Chefs.

Altogether, approximately 12 million kilograms of everything from fish to fowl will be purchased from food producers and then redistributed under the $50-million food surplus program announced by the Liberals earlier this year.

The near shutdown of the hospitality industry has meant a sharp decline in the number of places to sell perishable foods.

That has led to litres of milk being dumped down drains, potatoes going bad in storage and farmers facing higher costs to hold on to animals they had nowhere to sell if slaughtered.

At the same time, food banks have reported sharp increases in the number of people seeking assistance, having lost their jobs due to the pandemic, and there were calls for the federal government to find a way to match up the two.

Story continues below advertisement

Lori Nikkel, the chief executive officer at Second Harvest, said pre-pandemic, an estimated 58 per cent of all the food produced for Canadians was going to waste.

That number was definitely pushed higher by COVID-19, she said, and she applauded the federal government’s leadership in spooling up the program.

Second Harvest uses an online platform, FoodRescue.ca, to link up organizations that need food for their programs with farmers and producers who have surplus goods.

They received $11-million from the government to expand that program to include paying producers directly for their food, and ensure the groups on the receiving end have what they need to process, distribute and store it.

Ms. Nikkel said the money will go fast, and she hopes the federal government will consider a new round of funding at a later date as the need will not go away.

“The commodities are going to change,” she said.

Story continues below advertisement

“Who we are helping now may not be the people we are helping tomorrow.”

Ms. Bibeau said the government will keep an eye on whether the demand from organizations, and oversupply from producers, remains in the coming months.

“We’ll keep the door open in the sense that for now, we feel it’s a very worthwhile program, and we look forward to seeing how it will evolve in the coming weeks.”

Ten per cent of the product being purchased by the surplus program is being sent to northern communities.

Among the projects focused on those is one with Fisher River Cree Nation in Manitoba, which received $10.8-million to catch millions of kilograms of walleye and redistribute the fish to more than 75 Indigenous communities.

WE Charity told federal MPs it had registered Thursday with the federal lobbying registry, months after receiving a $543.5-million contract to run the government’s student grant program.

Dalal Al-Waheidi, the executive director of WE Charity, told the House of Commons finance committee that the organization did not register previously because it didn’t think it was necessary under lobbying rules.

“If I thought that registration was required, we would have done it,” Ms. Al-Waheidi told members of Parliament.

Ms. Al-Waheidi testified on the same day that WE announced it was cutting 67 full-time and contract staff in Toronto and closing its office in London, putting another 19 employees out of work.

She testified alongside Scott Baker, chief operations officer of WE Charity, and Sofia Marquez, who previously worked as WE Charity’s director of government and stakeholder relations.

MPs questioned Ms. Marquez about her lobbying efforts and why she didn’t register. Lobbying rules require corporations to register when the cumulative lobbying activities of all employees adds up to a “significant part of duties,” which has been defined as the equivalent of 20 per cent or more of the working hours of one full-time employee, over a one-month period.

Prime Minister Trudeau and WE Charity: The controversy explained

Ms. Marquez said the time she spent lobbying different levels of government “varied” and that she is not able to provide MPs with a percentage of how much time she spent lobbying.

Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre questioned Ms. Marquez about her communication with the Prime Minister’s Office and Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s office. Ms. Marquez said she has communicated with staff in Mr. Morneau’s office and e-mailed a staffer in the PMO. She also had a half-hour phone call with a policy director in the PMO on May 5 about the “current state of the proposal.” Ms. Marquez said she was also on a phone call with Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth Bardish Chagger and WE co-founder Craig Kielburger.

The contract was signed on June 23 but came into effect on May 5, 2020. WE has said the May 5 date reflects when it began working on the project and incurring eligible expenditures to design, build and prepare to deliver the program. However, cabinet’s final decision was made more than two weeks later.

Mr. Poilievre asked Ms. Marquez repeatedly whether the PMO said WE could begin implementing the program, given May 5 is the date WE began its work. She said she was not aware of the contract being implemented and her conversation was not about the project’s implementation.

“Well it’s an incredible coincidence that WE, that your organization, has suddenly registered to lobby all of these months after all of the lobbying happened,” Mr. Poilievre said.

In its filing to the federal lobbyist registry, WE Charity disclosed 65 communications with federal officials or ministers in 19 different departments or federal institutions, dating as far back as January, 2019. It lists 18 individuals, including Ms. Al-Waheidi, as in-house lobbyists for the organization. Craig and Marc Kielburger, the brothers who founded WE Charity, are not listed even though they have talked to ministers.

Opposition parties last month asked lobbying commissioner Nancy Bélanger to investigate whether WE Charity violated the Lobbying Act.

Members of Parliament questioned the three committee witnesses Thursday about who in government gave WE the green light to implement the program. No one provided a name, and Mr. Baker said the organization never felt it had the green light, but understood that to deliver the program, it had to build it in May and June.

WE has been embroiled in controversy over a $543.5-million federal volunteer program called the Canada Student Services Grant. The government gave WE a contract to administer the program, which included up to $43.5-million to cover expenses. The agreement was cancelled on July 3 amid conflict-of-interest allegations involving Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose family members have been paid to speak at WE events. Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Morneau have both apologized for not recusing themselves from the decision around WE. The charity received $30-million in expenses and has promised to pay back the full amount although $8-million remains outstanding.

The controversy erupted amid a pandemic that has dried up donations and forced the charity to lay off more than 200 workers in March. The layoffs caused dissension among WE’s board of directors and led to the resignation of chair Michelle Douglas, who said she and other members quit in late March over concerns about the lack of financial transparency.

Ms. Al-Waheidi told the committee Thursday that the combination of the pandemic and the controversy had been devastating and forced WE to scale back.

WE plans to keep its 43,000 square-foot Toronto headquarters, called the Global Learning Centre, but Ms. Al-Waheidi said in a statement it is “actively assessing which real estate holdings could be sold.” That includes buildings in Toronto that were supposed to be used to provide free space for not-for-profit social enterprises.

WE holds roughly $40-million worth of property in Canada, which includes around 10 buildings in Toronto. The organization has already cancelled all WE Day events, the organization’s annual celebration of volunteers, and suspended partnerships with most corporate sponsors. It is also assessing all of its operations.

Britain had been a major centre for WE and the group has had a separate British charity for 10 years.

Ms. Al-Waheidi said that while WE’s British operations will be centralized in Toronto, the organization will continue to have a registered charity in Britain overseen by a British board of directors. That arrangement will be reviewed in a year, she added.

The Globe has a sponsorship partnership with WE Charity. The agreement expires on Aug. 31 and will not be renewed.

Canada’s official fiscal watchdog says the federal wage subsidy program might cost $14-billion less than the government predicted.

A new report today by Parliamentary Budget Office analyst Ben Segel-Brown estimates subsidizing wages for companies during the COVID-19 pandemic will cost $67.9-billion through the end of December.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau estimated in his July fiscal report it would cost $82.3-billion.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Segel-Brown says that figure was prudent at the time because of economic uncertainty and continuing work to update the program’s rules.

The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy encourages employers to keep their workers on the payroll even as work slows because of the pandemic by offering to cover as much as 75 per cent of wages.

The program was initially just for three months, but it has since been extended and the amount of the subsidy now ranges from 10 per cent to 75 per cent depending on how much a company’s revenue have dropped each month.

The report also expects another $500-million in foregone payroll contributions such as employment insurance, but the costs are offset by an expected $9.1-billion in corporate taxes on the wage subsidy.

That would mean the ultimate cost of the program could be around $59.2-billion.

More than 285,000 employers have been approved for the subsidy as of Aug. 9, and Ottawa has paid out $26.5-billion to date. More than 800,000 employees have seen their wages subsidized.

The maximum weekly benefit in the first four months was $847. That amount will get smaller for most employers each month, until it hits $226 in November. Some companies whose revenue are most affected by the economic shutdowns can apply for a top-up that could increase the amount.

Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said Ottawa will not tolerate the intimidation of human rights activists in this country by foreign governments after a democracy activist told a parliamentary committee she and her family have faced threats from Beijing over the past year.

But Amnesty International said Wednesday that Canada’s response to rising complaints about bullying by pro-China forces has been hapless, muddled and ineffective.

Parliamentary hearings on Canada-China relations this week in Ottawa included testimony from Canadians of Hong Kong origin, who described threats they’ve received on Canadian soil during the course of their advocacy for democratic rights in the former British colony.

Story continues below advertisement

Cherie Wong, executive director of Alliance Canada Hong Kong, told the Commons committee on Canada-China relations that she has been the target of “death and rape threats,” as well as talk of harming her family, over the past 12 months. At rallies – even on Parliament Hill – pro-Beijing supporters have harassed and threatened those demonstrating in support of Hong Kong. Afterward, the personal information of pro-Hong Kong demonstrators – cellphone numbers, e-mail addresses, photos, class schedules – was published online.

Her experience echoes a May report by Amnesty International Canada and other groups warning that Chinese government officials and supporters of the Communist Party of China are increasingly resorting to “threats, bullying and harassment” to intimidate and silence activists in Canada, including those raising concerns about democracy and civil rights in Hong Kong, and Beijing’s mistreatment of Uyghurs, Tibetans and Falun Gong practitioners.

This intimidation includes threats of sexual violence and other physical violence against targets in Canada, as well as their family members in Hong Kong and China.

Conservative foreign affairs critic Leona Alleslev asked Mr. Champagne on Wednesday in the House of Commons about testimony such as Ms. Wong’s, and whether the government would introduce legislation to fight foreign interference.

“Witnesses at the Canada-China committee stated the People’s Republic of China is actively threatening Canadians on Canadian soil who seek to expose China’s authoritarian agenda. These individuals have been subjected to everything from physical threats, commercial blacklisting and state-backed cyberhacking with no protection from Canada. When will this government introduce legislation to combat foreign influence and protect basic human rights in Canada from aggressive actions of the Chinese Communist Party?” Ms. Alleslev asked.

Mr. Champagne told the Commons that Canada does not allow such intimidation and said Ottawa has been swift to address it.

“Let me be very clear, the safety and protection of Canadians is paramount to this government. We will never allow any form of foreign interference in Canada by state or non-state actors,” the Foreign Affairs Minister said.

He said Canada has acted whenever complaints have arisen. “Every time there have been allegations … we have taken action with the Minister of Public Safety,” he said, and advised Canadians to contact the police if they are being threatened.

“We invite any Canadians who might be subject to any form of such actions that have been described to contact law enforcement authorities and we will always defend the freedom and liberty of Canadians in Canada from foreign interference.”

But Alex Neve, secretary-general at Amnesty International Canada, said the response from Canadian authorities to such complaints has been unco-ordinated and disappointing. He said that in 2017 and again in May this year, Amnesty and other groups in the Canadian Coalition on Human Rights in China published reports on the intimidation and threats, as well as recommendations to address it – but these have received little response.

He said targets of harassment end up discouraged. “Individuals have often found they turn to one agency only to be told to go to another, and yet another, and at the end of the day told, ‘Well, we share the concern, but there’s not really anything that can be done here because it’s not a clear criminal offence,’ or, ‘You don’t have enough evidence.’ ”

The Amnesty-led coalition has recommended establishing a point person and hotline to handle complaints, talking to China about the harassment, and the consideration of a law to counter foreign interference as other countries such as Australia have enacted.

Mr. Neve said the response from the Canadian government, from security agencies and from police “lacks coherence and at the end of the day therefore is entirely ineffective.”

“Individuals experiencing these instances of interference and of threats, including threats of sexual and other physical violence and threats against family members in Hong Kong or in China, are largely left without effective recourse, often unsure where to turn and what to expect,” he said in recommendations provided to the Canada-China committee this week.

“It may be a considerable challenge to counter China’s influence on the world stage, it may be difficult to exert pressure for human rights reform on the ground in China, but there is no excuse for a failure to take robust and decisive steps to counter human rights abuses that may be linked to or backed by Beijing – connected to what is happening in Hong Kong, but taking place here in Canada.”

The Chinese embassy in Ottawa did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Outgoing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says his replacement must quickly put together a strong team in the Commons and for the next campaign, and he’s happy to offer whatever advice needed on that score.

But there are two other pieces of advice he hopes whoever is elected later this month will also find a way to heed: the need for a leader to communicate authentically and to break through into the cities and suburbs whose voters are essential if the Tories are to win a majority government.

“That is the critical ingredient,” he said Wednesday in a wide-ranging interview with The Canadian Press on what was his last day in the House of Commons as Opposition Leader.

By the time the House of Commons sits again, the Conservatives will have elected Andrew Scheer's replacement. Scheer spent just over three years as leader of the party but resigned in the aftermath of the last election when he failed to win a majority. The Canadian Press

His failure to win that majority sparked both an internal and external debate in the aftermath of the 2019 federal election that eventually led Mr. Scheer to resign, pending the result of the Conservative leadership race.

The vote is finally coming to an end Aug. 21, after being delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and four candidates are in the running: current MPs Erin O’Toole and Derek Sloan, former cabinet minister Peter MacKay and Toronto lawyer Leslyn Lewis.

Mr. Sloan and Ms. Lewis both come from the social conservative wing of the party. Both have promised that if they do win, they would include legislation curtailing access to abortion on their agenda.

Though Mr. Scheer promised he’d never allow a Conservative government to bring forward legislation on abortion, his own social conservative views on the subject were a flashpoint during the campaign.

Mr. MacKay once infamously called them an “albatross” hanging around the party’s neck.

Mr. Scheer dodged a question Wednesday on whether, if an avowed social conservative is elected as the next leader, the party would just find itself stuck dealing with the subject anew.

He said he still believes a prime minister can be a social conservative, and it’s only under the current Liberals that people who hold those views have come to be demonized in the public square.

Mr. Scheer is only the second permanent leader the Conservative Party of Canada has had since it was formed in a merger of the Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservatives.

Stephen Harper became the leader of the new party in 2004, and would go on to lead the Tories through a succession of minority governments before winning a majority in 2011.

In the majority years, Mr. Scheer – who had first been elected an MP from Regina in 2004 – served as Speaker of the House of Commons, but when the Tories lost power in 2015 and Mr. Harper resigned, he decided to try for leadership.

He won in a squeaker of a vote in 2017.

“We ended up seeing a bit of a division, a potential division after the last leadership,” said Alberta MP Matt Jeneroux.

“Andrew Scheer came in, he kept this party together, he kept this party united. That’s really going to be his legacy.”

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Scheer said Wednesday he does consider that an accomplishment, and a challenge that his replacement will face.

The race this time, by all accounts, has been far nastier inside caucus than in 2017.

But the context is also different than when Mr. Scheer took the helm that year.

The unprecedented situation forced by the COVID-19 pandemic means the next leader, if elected prime minister, could inherit a government with a historically high deficit, among other major economic and social challenges.

For a party that’s built its brand on keeping government small and costs down, it will require thoughtful policy, Mr. Scheer said.

“Many on the left are going to try to use the pandemic as a justification for a return to the failed policies of the past,” he said.

Story continues below advertisement

“One of the things I believe the next leader of the party here, and advocates for free market economics around the world, will have to do is rewin the battles that we won in the eighties.”

Then, communist and socialist states in Eastern Europe and elsewhere were flailing against the economic growth taking place in capitalist societies, he said, making it clear that the recipe for success isn’t more government intervention but letting people and markets take the lead.

“What we have to do in our party here in Canada is find a way to communicate that message in a way that people can appreciate and support,” he said.

The next leader needs to be mindful of the true communications challenge posed by political life, he said.

“You have to maintain your authenticity and still allow who you are to flow through and connect with people,” he said.

“But it’s also a very difficult environment because you have to always be polishing a message.”

Story continues below advertisement

One message that Mr. Scheer said he heard loud and clear late last fall was that he was missing too much in the lives of his five children.

It was a late-night kitchen conversation with his teenage son, Thomas, that cemented his decision to step down, a conversation that came as the fact he was using party funds to pay for their private school tuition was becoming a public issue.

That his kids were pulled into the political morass is part of the job, he said, but he hopes they will take away from the entire experience that politics can be a positive force.

“You go through a lot of criticism online, in the media, from your opponents but you can also have a tremendously positive impact on your community,” he said.

Mr. Scheer said he will remain the MP for Regina-Qu’Appelle, and will serve in whatever capacity the new leader requests.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says his party will keep digging for answers on how the Liberals decided to award COVID-19 related support programs to organizations with close Liberal ties. Scheer says both the WE controversy and a decision to outsource a rent-relief program to a company that employs the spouse of the prime minister’s chief of staff are problematic. The Canadian Press

Ontario has released a new quarterly financial report today that now pegs the year’s deficit at $38.5-billion, up sharply from March’s numbers. Of course, a lot has happened since then: the COVID-19 pandemic and the public-health measures taken to slow outbreaks, for instance.

TODAY’S HEADLINES

The Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement that Justin Trudeau has “full confidence” in Finance Minister Bill Morneau. However, sources tell The Globe that a cabinet shuffle is in the works and Mr. Morneau’s position is not safe.

Toronto lawyer Annamie Paul has raised the most money so far in the Green Party leadership race, which continues until October.

Human-rights advocates are urging Canada to do much more in opposition to China’s crackdown in Hong Kong.

Ten years after the MV Sun Sea arrived on the B.C. coast carrying hundreds of Tamil migrants wanting to apply for refugee status in Canada, many cases are still not resolved. One man who received refugee status in 2018 told The Globe he was dismayed to see how quickly cases of Syrian refugees were processed given that, at that time, his own claim had not yet been dealt with.

And Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has picked Kamala Harris as his vice-presidential candidate. Ms. Harris, a senator from California and former state attorney-general, is seen as a strong fundraiser who will bring a jolt of energy to the campaign.

Campbell Clark (The Globe and Mail) on Trudeau’s statement of support for Morneau: “That will be familiar to sports fans, who will recognize it as the kind of thing the general manager says the day before the coach gets fired.”

Story continues below advertisement

Andrew Coyne (The Globe and Mail) on Trudeau, Morneau and the entrance of Mark Carney: “How much better for both men for Mr. Morneau to exit over a question of policy, allowing each to simultaneously claim the high ground: as either the last voice of relative fiscal sanity in this government, or the author of a bold new vision of federal activism – with help from the most admired central banker of his generation.”

Robyn Urback (The Globe and Mail) on Canada’s lack of retaliation to China’s aggressive moves: “Just about the only action Canada has taken over the past several months was to suspend the Canada-Hong Kong extradition treaty after the passage of the national security law, and to stop exporting certain military items to Hong Kong. But in that case, Canada had no choice: To not take action would have been to compromise our own national security. Yet to Beijing’s other abuses, including those that directly affect Canadian citizens (hundreds of thousands of whom live in Hong Kong), Canada just sputters some words.”

Sharon Davis-Murdoch, Charisma Grace and Jalana Lewis (CBC) on addressing anti-Black racism in the health-care system: “Yes, people of African descent are genetically predisposed to diabetes, but the challenges go beyond ethnicity. They are related to social determinants of health, including lived experience of systemic racism, distrust of the health system, higher rates of poverty and rural isolation.”

Nam Kiwanuka (TVO) on Ontario’s school reopening plan: “How did the government actually prepare for this upcoming school year? By all accounts, everything will be much the same as it was this past school year, with a few tweaks. Class sizes will be the same. Having students in high school going only every other day is a glaring example of phoning it in.”

The Innu Nation has filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission alleging the federal government spends more money removing children from homes than keeping families together.

Gregory Rich, grand chief of the Innu Nation, which represents the Innu of Labrador, said in a statement Tuesday Canada’s child welfare system has had devastating consequences.

The complaint, which was filed in June, says the federal government gives Newfoundland and Labrador more money for the foster care system compared with the funds it provides to help families.

A 2016 Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decision found the federal government’s unequal funding for child welfare services discriminated against children who live on reserves. That ruling called for “immediate relief” for First Nations children.

Mr. Rich, however, said funding from Ottawa remains inadequate and Innu children are suffering.

He said the federal government spends 10 times more money placing children in foster care compared with investments into community-based prevention services that help keep families united.

“Innu Nation is taking action to stand up for our children,” he said in the Tuesday statement. “And the least the federal government can do is what the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has ordered.

“Until that happens, our children and families are facing the consequences, and that means more lives lost or destroyed.”

Mr. Rich said one Innu child out of every 10 has been taken out of their home as a result of the current funding system.

A 15-year-old Innu boy from Natuashish died by suicide in May at a government-approved group home in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Mr. Rich said. The teenager’s death led to renewed calls for the long-awaited inquiry into the treatment of Innu children in the care of Newfoundland and Labrador’s child protection services.

Story continues below advertisement

The provincial government and Innu leaders formally agreed in 2017 to hold an inquiry after the suicide of 16-year-old Thunderheart Tshakapesh earlier that year. Mr. Rich said the death of the teenager in May is the “the latest tragedy that has devastated our families in so many ways.”

The human-rights complaint alleges an Innu agency created to help children was denied funding because it didn’t provide foster care services.

According to the Innu Nation’s filing with the human-rights commission, Ottawa said the agency, called the Innu Round Table Secretariat, did not meet the federal government’s requirements for needs-based funding. Ottawa also said funding from the federal government had to be delegated by the province.

That decision has created bureaucratic hurdles that are “illogical, unduly onerous, arbitrary … and unnecessary,” the Innu Nation alleges.

Terry Duguid, a Winnipeg MP and parliamentary secretary for Western Economic Diversification Canada, says the COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty for many food-related businesses.

He says the government intends the funds to help them weather that and be well-positioned for future business.

The Liberals have been under sustained pressure from farmers and food producers to do more to address the issues the COVID-19 pandemic has created for the sector.

Among other things, there have been outbreaks of the illness among farm workers and in processing plants, and sharp declines for certain products due to the near shutdown of the entire hospitality industry leading to an oversupply of food with no markets.

While the federal government initially responded with a $252-million bailout package, they were criticized for including in that some previously announced money.

The funds being announced today comes from the budgets of the various federal economic development agencies, which focus on supporting hyper-local initiatives.

In some cases, the funding represents deals that were in the works well before the pandemic, or is being given to the companies in the form of repayable loans.

Duguid said while some of the money may have been earmarked pre-pandemic, it doesn’t discount the benefit it will bring to businesses.

“This is about today, this is about COVID, this is about a difficult time but it is also about the future,” he said.

Blair Gable/Reuters

The Prime Minister’s Office says Justin Trudeau has “full confidence” in Bill Morneau to navigate Canada’s economy through the COVID-19 crisis, but did not say whether he would remain in the job after a cabinet shuffle expected in the coming weeks.

The Globe and Mail reported on Tuesday the Prime Minister is not committed to keeping Mr. Morneau as the key architect of the government’s economic revival plans after the two clashed over policy, and concerns about the minister’s involvement in the WE Charity scandal.

Facing intense media scrutiny and reaction from market analysts over whether Mr. Trudeau had lost confidence in the Finance Minister, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) issued a statement on Tuesday afternoon affirming its support of Mr. Morneau.

Story continues below advertisement

“Of course the Prime Minister has full confidence in Minister Morneau, and any statement to the contrary is false,” the PMO said. “The Prime Minister knows that Minister Morneau and the entire team of cabinet ministers will keep up doing the work that Canadians rely on to get them through this pandemic.”

At the helm of the treasury, Bill Morneau has been left hanging

A senior government official said the PMO had to issue the statement because other media had interpreted The Globe story as meaning Mr. Morneau would be removed as finance minister when, in fact, no decision has been made.

The statement did not say Mr. Morneau would continue as finance minister if Mr. Trudeau shuffles his cabinet, as expected before the return of Parliament in September, but lauded him for his role during the coronavirus shutdown and for past economic measures, including reforms to the Canada Pension Plan.

“Since we formed government, Minister Morneau has worked relentlessly with all his colleagues, and closely with the Prime Minister, to deliver critical support for Canadians to build a strong and resilient economy,” the PMO statement said.

The Globe also reported on Tuesday that the PMO was surprised when Mr. Morneau revealed he recently repaid the WE organization about $41,000 in expenses for trips he and his family took with the charity. Senior officials told The Globe on Monday that he failed to let anyone in government know about the trips to Kenya and Ecuador in 2017. The Ethics Commissioner is investigating Mr. Morneau and Mr. Trudeau over a contract that was awarded to the charity.

The Globe is not identifying the senior officials or the other sources for this story because they were not authorized to speak publicly about Mr. Trudeau’s plans for a cabinet remake that could lead to the departure of Mr. Morneau, a Toronto businessman who was named Finance Minister in 2015.

A source who has regular contact with Mr. Morneau said on Tuesday that he and his staff were blindsided to find out Mr. Trudeau was debating the Finance Minister’s future and that the PMO has hurt his credibility at a crucial time. The relationship can’t be easily repaired unless the Prime Minister gives his personal and continued support to his Finance Minister, the source said.

On Monday, the Finance Minister’s office said Mr. Morneau has no plans to leave politics and is engaged in reviving the economy.

“Minister Morneau fully intends to keep working on the Prime Minister’s team and getting Canadians through the pandemic,” communications director Pierre-Olivier Herbert told The Globe.

Craig Alexander, chief economist of Deloitte Canada, lauded Mr. Morneau for his stewardship of the economy during the COVID-19 lockdown, but said he did not think the uncertainty over the Finance Minister’s future would rattle investor confidence in Canada.

“Mr. Morneau has done a very good job. He has been Finance Minister in a very difficult time, and the government’s response to the pandemic and the likely economic consequences was the right one,” he said. “I doubt markets are responding significantly to any of the political uncertainty at the moment.”

He said markets would wait to see if policies change.

“If the answer is that there is a change of leadership but it doesn’t suggest any change in the current government stance as the appropriate policy response to the current crisis, then markets are unlikely to to be significantly affected,” he said.

The federal government has provided $160-billion in direct COVID-19 support, and the deficit this fiscal year is projected to hit $343-billion, the largest shortfall since the Second World War.

Insiders said earlier this week that Mr. Trudeau is thinking about a possible new finance minister as he examines new stimulus and social safety net measures.

During the lockdown, the Prime Minister came to rely on Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England and Bank of Canada, for informal policy advice, and now on plans to revive the economy, sources said.

The sources did not deny that Mr. Carney could replace Mr. Morneau if he is interested, although he would need to win a seat in Parliament. Other contenders are Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne and Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos, the insiders said.

The Prime Minister and Mr. Morneau disagreed over plans to move the Canada Emergency Response Benefit into a revamped and broader Employment Insurance Program, sources said. The PMO wants a two-year freeze on premiums, while Mr. Morneau prefers a one-year freeze to save money, sources said.

In the early rollout of coronavirus relief, Mr. Trudeau overruled Mr. Morneau on several important measures, including the Finance Minister’s preference for a 10-per-cent wage subsidy. The Globe reported in April that the subsidy was increased to 75 per cent under pressure from Mr. Trudeau. The Prime Minister also instructed Mr. Morneau to drop legislation that would have given the Finance Department extended taxing and spending powers until the end of 2021, sources have said.

The Canadian government is being urged to do more than issue written condemnation of China’s crackdown on Hong Kong, but a governing Liberal MP says he’s concerned how further action might imperil efforts to free two Canadians locked up by Beijing.

A parliamentary committee holding hearings Tuesday on the deterioration of civil rights in Hong Kong was pressed to support measures that could help Hong Kongers, including offering safe haven to asylum seekers here. Canada has released several statements of concern about Hong Kong and suspended an extradition treaty with the former British colony in July.

“It is not enough to call out Beijing’s violations – it is critically and urgently important to put an end to the extraordinary sense of impunity Beijing continues to enjoy for wide-scale state-sponsored human rights violations,” Sophie Richardson, China director of Human Rights Watch, told the House of Commons special committee on Canada-China relations.

A number of Canadian advocates for democracy in Hong Kong and human rights campaigners raised the idea of sanctioning Chinese officials responsible for human rights violations there. The United States last week imposed sanctions on Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, and 10 others.

Canada must resist the temptation to sink into a new cold war with China

They proposed that Canada use the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act, also known as the Sergei Magnitsky Law, to sanction officials. It’s named after a Russian tax expert who was tortured and died in a Moscow prison after uncovering fraud in Russia.

Aileen Calverley, the co-founder of British-based Hong Kong Watch, said sanctions could make life difficult for Hong Kong officials, telling MPs the partners of the city’s Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng and Secretary of Education Kevin Yeung have Canadian citizenship, and the Secretary of State for Home Affairs, Caspar Tsui Ying-Wai, owns property in Canada.

However, Peter Fragiskatos, a London, Ont., member of Parliament with the governing Liberal Party, raised concerns during Tuesday’s hearings about how tougher action on Hong Kong might anger China and jeopardize Canadian attempts to free Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

The two men were detained by Chinese authorities in what was widely seen as retaliation shortly after Canada arrested Huawei Technologies executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant. The pair were subsequently charged with espionage and more than 600 days later remain incarcerated.

“If the government of Canada was to move ahead in that direction, I wonder about the consequences for Canadians in China, namely the two Michaels,” Mr. Fragiskatos said.

“If Canada was to take dramatic action along those lines, what is the prospect for those two individuals. ... Is it reasonable to suggest and assume that it would dramatically diminish the prospect of the release of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor?”

Story continues below advertisement

Alex Neve, secretary-general at Amnesty International Canada, told MPs the best way for Canada to take action is as part of a bigger coalition.

“To go down that road is inevitably going to be much more successful if it’s done on a multilateral basis, that it isn’t just Canada ... as one of a very small handful of states pursuing this,” he said.

The first of several Commons meetings on Hong Kong was held one day after the arrest in Hong Kong of newspaper owner Jimmy Lai, whose Apple Daily publication is sharply critical of Beijing and a major champion of the pro-democracy movement.

The move against Mr. Lai is the latest feature of Beijing’s clampdown against pro-democracy opposition in the city. China imposed a sweeping new security law on Hong Kong on June 30, drawing condemnation from Western countries.

Davin Wong, director of youth engagement and policy initiatives at Alliance Canada Hong Kong, an umbrella group of pro-democracy advocates in Canada, pleaded with MPs to consider the deep and long-standing ties between this country and the former British colony.

More than 300,000 Canadians live there and, during the Second World War, nearly 2,000 Canadian soldiers fought and died for the territory – a contribution to the city’s defence that ultimately claimed more than 550.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Wong noted the new national security law – which targets “subversion,” “secession” and “collusion with foreign forces” – is extraterritorial, meaning it applies to anyone, anywhere in the world. China has signed extradition treaties with nearly 60 countries around the world and has already issued warrants for six overseas critics under the new Hong Kong national security law.

“This committee should pay attention to Beijing’s long arms and the interference that is already effectively undermining our freedoms in Canada,” he said.

Richard Kurland, a Vancouver-based lawyer, said suspending Canada’s extradition treaty with Hong Kong was a practical move. “Under Beijing’s new security law, the potential for a large number of extradition requests looms large. Charter of Rights challenges to these requests would likely shut down every extradition case, so why bother having the extradition treaty?”

The Canadian Press

Canada’s decision to increase its humanitarian aid to Lebanon recognizes the country already faced significant turmoil before last week’s explosion and will need long-term support, International Development Minister Karina Gould said Tuesday.

The Liberal government was criticized last week for promising only an initial $5 million – including $2 million to match donations from Canadians – to help the people of Lebanon struggling to recover from the deadly blast in Beirut.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced an additional $25 million Monday evening, which will go to humanitarian aid agencies and organizations that work in the region.

Story continues below advertisement

The funding to match donations has now been expanded to a maximum of $5 million.

Gould said in an interview with The Canadian Press that Ottawa realized more would be needed and requests from international aid organizations would start coming in.

“We just made the decision to increase it knowing that the appeals will be coming out shortly, they will be significant, and we want to ensure that Canada is ready to be able to respond in as timely a manner as possible,” Gould said Tuesday.

The Aug. 4 blast is believed to have been detonated by thousands of tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored for seven years at a portside warehouse. More than 150 people were killed in the explosion, thousands more were injured and an estimated 300,000 residents were left homeless.

Canada’s additional aid was announced just hours after Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab announced the resignation of his government following days of angry protests. He blamed the blast on “the result of endemic corruption.”

Canada has been a long-standing partner in bringing assistance to the people of Lebanon before the explosion, Gould said, including an allocation of $47 million this year alone, made through trusted partners, to address the pre-existing crisis.

“Canada will continue to be there. That’s one of the reasons why we announced the additional $25 million: recognizing that the situation in Lebanon was already significantly challenged before the explosion last Tuesday, and now it’s only going to be even more difficult because of this.”

Story continues below advertisement

The country has been led by a political ruling class, made up mostly of former civil war-era leaders, and it is being blamed for incompetence and mismanagement that contributed to the explosion.

This has sparked protests of anger, which led to clashes between security forces and demonstrators Saturday in central Beirut over the weekend.

Gould said Canada is monitoring the situation on the ground, and is providing consular assistance to Canadians in Beirut, thanks to the reopening of the Canadian embassy in the Lebanese capital on Monday.

She could not provide details about Canadians in Lebanon who may want to come to Canada, citing a lack of clarity about this information at this time.

More than 200 refugee claims have been filed in Canada by asylum-seekers from Lebanon in the first three months of the year, with claimants alleging political persecution in a country that’s been plunged into chaos by a corrupt government and a collapsing economy.

That number of refugee claims so far this year is a significant increase from the previous two years. In all of 2019, 552 people made a claim against Lebanon, and 439 claims were made in all of 2018, according to statistics from the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.

Bassam Azzi, an immigration and refugee lawyer in Ottawa, said his office has heard from Lebanese citizens in Canada who are seeking ways to stay and also from people in Lebanon who have asked for advice on how to immigrate to Canada. He said the 202 claims filed in Canada this year could include people who are stateless in addition to Lebanese citizens.

“Because of the situation that’s going on in Lebanon – the economic crisis, the financial crisis – … people are just, in their own words, they’re ‘fed up’ and they don’t see Lebanon as a safe place for them to stay,” he said.

Mr. Azzi said those who are already inside Canada could be visitors, students or temporary residents and may have been politically active in Lebanon and fearful of returning because they criticized the government. Some, he said, have been threatened, so they have inquired about making a refugee claim. Others have said they are not politically active but are worried about living conditions.

Mr. Azzi said he is expecting to hear from “many more” people in Lebanon who are interested in immigrating to Canada or claiming asylum here after last week’s explosion in Beirut’s port that obliterated the facility, caused extensive destruction, killed at least 160 people and injured about 6,000 others.

Lebanon’s Prime Minister Hassan Diab resigned on Monday, saying in a televised speech that corruption in the country is “bigger than the state.”

Mr. Azzi said calls from people in Lebanon began in October, 2019, as citizens took to the streets to protest continuing corruption in government and banking.

“I think it is very sad what’s going on in Lebanon. I think the people are suffering,” he said, adding that many in Lebanon do not have access to basic services; there is limited access to health care as well as daily power shortages.

Lama Mourad, an assistant professor at Carleton University and an expert on Lebanon, said the uprising in October saw Lebanese civil society call out people in power in ways that hadn’t been seen before, and as a result, people are more worried about their physical safety and their lives.

“People are concerned; there are documented cases of activists and scholars having been taken to court or have been physically beaten for calling out corruption among the banking sector, in particular, and the Lebanese politicians and the intersection of the two,” Prof. Mourad said.

She said the increasing numbers of refugee claims in Canada is the result of how politicians and the banking class have responded toward activists, journalists and others who have spoken out.

Bessma Momani, a professor at the University of Waterloo, said even before the explosion, people in Lebanon felt there was no hope left in the country.

“I have no doubt that the vast majority of Lebanese are trying to find an exit strategy, and they will try to reach out to existing family. There’s more Lebanese in the diaspora than there are inside the country, quite literally more living outside than inside, and so they will be reaching out to family networks abroad,” she said.

On Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced an additional $25-million to assist people in Lebanon in the wake of the explosion. This brings Ottawa’s aid to a total of $30-million.

Kevin Lemkay, a spokesperson for Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino, said the federal government is working with partners such as the Red Cross to help meet the urgent needs of those affected by the explosion.

He added that Canada has been able to prioritize and resettle urgent cases from asylum seekers.

”All eligible asylum claimants receive a full and fair hearing on the individual merits of their claim at the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. We will continue to work with the [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and International Organization for Migration] and domestic organizations to maintain Canada’s commitment to offering asylum to the world’s most vulnerable,” he said.

If the index ends the day higher than its old record close, it would confirm that it has been in a bull market since the pandemic low.

Here’s a survey of reaction:

WILLIAM NORTHEY, SENIOR INVESTMENT DIRECTOR, U.S. BANK WEALTH MANAGEMENT, HELENA, MONTANA

“This is certainly a circumstance where capital markets are looking beyond the current earnings and economic chasm that have been created by the economic shutdowns in response to COVID-19. Capital markets are looking to 2021 and 2022 levels of recovery with a degree of optimism that there is a health solution around the corner.”

“It’s certainly aided by the fact that we have been supported by historically low interest rates and very accommodative policy. Not only from a monetary standpoint, but from a fiscal policy standpoint – both, here in the United States and abroad. The policy responses have been incredibly forceful and provided a necessary bridge through this voluntary economic shutdown as we deal with these conditions created by the pandemic.”

NEIL WILSON, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, MARKETS.COM, LONDON

“We saw a pullback in June and it’s been steadily marching forward since, so that record was on the cards. I’m still surprised we got there without additional stimulus. But my instinct, is that this is too high, it looks massively overbought, I mean, it’s not sustainable looking at the earnings. I think it’s mainly the liquidity being pumped into the system, all these funds need to go there. As we get closer to the election I’d expect more volatility and a pullback”.

BENJAMIN JONES, SENIOR MULTI-ASSET STRATEGIST AT STATE STREET GLOBAL MARKETS

“Though US equities are back to all-time highs there is a great deal of dispersion in returns for the year and the style, sector, and stock level. Growth, tech, and internet retail for example have posted solid gains this year as we have seen existing trends towards a greater reliance on technology accelerate in the wake of the pandemic.”

“I am not concerned that tech has driven a lot of the gains and that the largest five stocks make up such a large proportion of the S&P 500. These are firms that have solid fundamentals that are superior to the broader market and will benefit from recent trends. We do not find that this high concentration is a source of systemic risk.”

BRIAN PRICE, HEAD OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL NETWORK, WALTHAM, MASS.

“The path of least resistance seems to be higher for US equities as of late. Markets are seemingly encouraged by a nationwide improvement in coronavirus data after a spike in various parts of the country last month. Big tech and certain consumer companies like Amazon continue to do well but we’ve also seen an improvement in relative performance of cyclical and value-oriented names as of late. This dynamic should be viewed as healthy for the equity market as wider breadth could be key to determining whether or not stocks will continue their advance. There are plenty of risk factors that investors will continue to monitor, such as a resurgence in coronavirus cases, failure to pass another relief bill, and the upcoming elections. Investors are encouraged that we’re back near all-time highs in the market, but they’ll need to stay vigilant for what lies ahead over the coming months.”

JIM PAULSEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT THE LEUTHOLD GROUP IN MINNEAPOLIS

“I don’t know if I’d put a great deal of significance on this. It’s important in the short run particularly for traders. There’s no doubt about it. We have these psychological levels that are important for traders because markets move around them.”

“I’d put this in the same category as when the market is looking at a 200-day moving average. It’s a technical level that creates trading opportunities for shorter-term minded traders. It could create volatility. It could be a launching pad if it breaks through solidly to create a good few days on the upside but it could also mark a point where you want to sell for the next week. Often when we break a milestone we pause. All of that is true.”

TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, INVERNESS COUNSEL, NEW YORK

“It was inevitable. Markets go higher over the long term, and it’s a reflection that the pandemic has limited longevity and the economic downtown will also have limited longevity. There are companies that are doing well in this environment, and even doing better, primarily the growth stocks, which are not impacted by the decline in consumer spending.”

“It’s an emotional level. It’s a market rebound a lot of investors don’t understand and are skeptical about. But the stock market is about anticipating the future and we feel in about a year or so most of the population will be immunized with a vaccine, and the economy will begin to return to accelerated growth.”

KEITH LERNER, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, TRUIST/SUNTRUST ADVISORY SERVICES, ATLANTA

“It does confirm what we’ve been saying for several months: that this is a new bull market that we’re in. There’s mounting evidence in our work that suggests we’re in a bull market as a whole. We’ve been positive, increasing equities, since early April. So far what we’ve been seeing in this market is very consistent with what we tend to see coming out of meaningful lows. The one thing that’s different…this is by far the fastest recovery we’ve seen from a 30% decline.”

“In some ways, the market making a new high, along with (COVID-19) cases coming down, actually relieves some pressure on Congress to get something done (on renewing stimulus). That could be something in the short term that weighs on the market. Ultimately I think something will get done. I don’t think it’s a long-term risk.”

BRIAN BETHUNE, ECONOMIST, TUFTS UNIVERSITY, MEDFORD, MASS

“The problem we’re dealing with is the Fed has clobbered rates down across the yield curve. So where are people going to earn a return? The reason they’re going into the S&P 500 is because there’s a dividend yield and a buyback yield. There were some cutbacks so my guess is that the gross yield is down to 3%, that’s still 3%. So people are realizing this and now the funds are shifting out of fixed income into equities, and that creates a momentum play.

“Given the situation we find ourselves in, that’s a good thing, no question. I don’t buy into the view of the people who say it’s a bubble, it’s the reality of what’s going on in terms of zero returns on fixed income.

“The economy, generally speaking, is doing better than what people had expected. That’s the second piece of what is propping up the stock market. There was an over-correction on the downside and once people realized it was overdone, then it returned.”

OLIVER PURSCHE, PRESIDENT, CIO, BRONSON MEADOWS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, FAIRFIELD, CONN.

“The S&P 500 has been trying to make that new record for a while. We don’t know yet whether we’re going to close above it. But today’s housing starts number is clearly what’s lifting stocks a little today. Very strong earnings by Walmart are also helping the S&P. Those are the catalysts. It’s a slow melt up; it’s really a summer melt up.

“It’s too early to tell, because data keeps on changing, what coronavirus is going to look like in September, October, November, but the market is clearly betting it’s not going to be all that bad.”

The record confirms, according to a widely accepted definition, that Wall Street’s most closely followed index entered a bull market after hitting its pandemic low on March 23. It has surged about 55% since then.

That makes the bear market that started in late February the S&P 500′s shortest in its history.

Since the March 23 closing low, the S&P posted the largest gain in a 103-day period in 87 years, according to Refinitiv data.

Trillions of dollars in fiscal and monetary stimulus have made Wall Street flush with cash, pushing yield-seeking investors into equities. Amazon and other high growth technology-related stocks have been viewed as the most reliable to ride out the crisis.

Doubts about the underlying health of the economy, however, persisted in Tuesday’s session, with lukewarm reactions to bumper results from Home Depot and Walmart limiting gains.

The S&P 500 flirted with all-time highs for several sessions before finally hitting a new record, raising questions about whether this run of gains could last.

“The S&P 500 has been impressive and has created a lot of wealth, but I am not sure that reflects the overall health of the economy,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital.

“The rally has more to do with asset inflation, which is fueled by all the liquidity and all the continued support in the economy as well as the weakening dollar,” he added.

Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 67.32 points, or 0.24%, to 27,777.59, the S&P 500 gained 7.79 points, or 0.23%, to 3,389.78 and the Nasdaq Composite added 81.12 points, or 0.73%, to 11,210.84.

Consumer discretionary rose the most among major S&P sectors on strength in Amazon while technology stocks provided another major support to the benchmark index.

Home Depot Inc reported its biggest rise in quarterly same-store sales in at least two decades, however, its shares fell about 1% after analysts cautioned that its sales might have hit their peak.

Walmart Inc traded marginally higher after posting its biggest-ever growth in online sales as shoppers cashed in stimulus checks and ordered everything from electronics and toys to groceries from the safety of their homes amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data on Tuesday showed U.S. homebuilding accelerated by the most in nearly four years in July in the latest sign the housing sector is emerging as one of the few areas of strength in an economy suffering a record slowdown. That further added to market optimism.

Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s recent meeting due on Wednesday, meanwhile, may provide some insight into how the central bank sees the recovery playing out. The Fed has cut rates to near zero to bolster business through the pandemic.

Tijana Martin/The Canadian Press

Vonny Sweetland has yet to decide if he will be sending his 12-year-old sister Josephine back to class in September, but just in case he does, he’s been stocking up on supplies for months.

He picks up hand sanitizer when he sees it in stores, grabbed new masks last month, bought a fresh uniform and has been testing out Josephine’s muscle power with some new lunch containers.

The new additions to her backpack and are all part of a wave of changes families – and their wallets – are being confronted with as they prepare for back to school, whether it’s sourcing protective equipment or choosing a thermos their child can open unassisted.

“In a COVID-era, all of these things we take for granted or think are minuscule are actually really important,” said Sweetland, who is his sister’s guardian.

“These are things as simple as a teacher helping you unpack your lunch or zipping a zipper. To prevent potential spread, I don’t think teachers are really going to be doing these things.”

The cost of so many new supplies can easily add up.

A Deloitte survey of 1,200 parents who have at least one child attending school in grades K-12 this fall found the average family will spend $102 on school supplies, $216 on clothing and accessories, $395 on computers and hardware, $316 on electronic gadgets and digital subscriptions.

The survey, which was conducted between May and July, found those families will allocate $61 on a new category: home or health supplies.

Even so, back-to-school shopping doesn’t have to be more expensive than any other year, said Seung Hwan (Mark) Lee, an associate professor of retail management at Ryerson University.

He recommends shoppers compare prices and take advantage of sales.

Story continues below advertisement

Anne Marie Taber said she’s noticed plenty of sales, though she hasn’t sought them out when shopping with seven-year-old daughter Avery because she tries to minimize her time in stores and instead use online options with delivery to lessen her exposure to the virus.

She stocked up as soon as she could on Old Navy’s uniform-style clothing because several sizes were out of stock and also grabbed Avery a new backpack.

On top of masks and hand sanitizers, they bought a wide-mouth water bottle without a straw to make cleaning easy, plastic Duo-Tangs that can be wiped down and a set of art supplies that Avery has been reminded not to share.

“This is extra stuff we haven’t had to buy in the past but it’s a small dollar to pay to make sure that that is just hers exclusively,” Taber said.

Parents may also want to consider disposable cutlery, if they have children that bring lunches to school and are worried about germs spreading through anything reuseable, Lee said.

If your child is doing virtual classes, he suggests ensuring you have a reliable laptop or tablet with a webcam.

Those who want to go all out or are older and have specific needs for programs they are enrolled in, may need to think about microphones and speakers too.

Those supplies don’t come cheap. However, the cost of those high-ticket items could be partially offset by a change he sees happening across universities and colleges during the pandemic.

“It’s no longer really about carrying around the heavy textbooks,” he said.

“Many professors aren’t holding lengthy exams because the exams are becoming very difficult to monitor and you can’t really get a proctor to look at how students are conducting their exams... so using test banks or textbooks no longer apply.”

If you’re feeling anxious or stressed about back to school shopping and advertisements are making you feel you better get to a store soon, Lee says not worry.

“I would advise parents right now not to rush into getting supplies,” he said.

World stocks have bounced back by 51 per cent from their mid-March lows, adding US$24-trillion in value in five months as investors bet on a rapid rebound in economic activity after record plunges.

Of the 181 survey participants, who manage half-a-trillion U.S. dollars in assets, a net 79 per cent expect a stronger economy, the strongest reading since December, 2009.

“Asset allocation stubbornly skewed toward U.S. growth stocks,” BofA said. But it added “green shoots” were appearing for inflation assets and rotation into Europe and emerging market equities, which have lagged tech-heavy U.S. stocks.

The survey found that the “most crowded” trade for the fourth month running was a long position in U.S. tech and growth stocks, the ultimate beneficiaries of pandemic-led transformations in the way people work, study and shop.

The long gold trade was the second most crowded, with a net 31 per cent saying the metal was “overvalued,” the most since 2011 after no participants said they considered it to be so last month. Gold rose above US$2,000 an ounce for the first time earlier this month.

As global equities near record highs again, strategists told Reuters that the quickfire bear-to-bull switch was not only justified but deserves to go further.

But evidence of a fresh rise coronavirus infections in some countries has led to caution and the survey showed that a “second wave” of the pandemic was still seen as the biggest risk to markets for the fifth straight month.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been an adjustment for most financial advisors, who have had to work from home and meet with clients virtually amid extreme market volatility, but the experience has been a bit different for those at smaller firms.

Accessing resources to work out of the office, such as additional computers, telephones and extra internet bandwidth, has been a challenge for smaller firms – especially when competing with bigger counterparts seeking the same equipment and services.

But for smaller firms and their advisors, this size has allowed them to be more nimble when it comes to helping clients find solutions and cope with the fallout from the pandemic. The COVID-19 crisis has also been a test of these firms’ business-continuity plans, with mostly positive results.

“When you’re smaller, it’s much easier to mobilize,” says Debra Hewson, president and chief executive officer of Vancouver-based investment management firm Odlum Brown Ltd., which has about 100 advisors across five offices in British Columbia overseeing about $15-billion in client assets.

Odlum Brown has invested heavily in its remote access platform over the past 18 months, ensuring it was accessible and secure. The inspiration, in part, was an increasingly mobile workforce – as well as the possibility of an event that could force staff to work away from the office, such as a power outage or earthquake.

“We did it for business continuity reasons,” Ms. Hewson says. “We certainly didn’t plan on a pandemic, but when COVID-19 hit, we were fortunate to be able to mobilize our people to work from home really quickly. When they turned on their computers at home, they had the same experience, technology-wise, as if they were in the office. That was really helpful.”

She says the client experience was relatively seamless, except for the inability to meet in person due to physical distancing requirements, which was difficult for some during the market meltdown in March.

During that volatile period, in particular, the firm spent a lot of time communicating with each other and with clients through different channels including e-mail, telephone and video calls, “because everyone takes information differently,” Ms. Hewson says.

“I’d like to say it was business as usual for us, just a bit more frequent. I’m quite proud of that. It’s not like we had to come up with a new way of doing things. A lot of this we were already doing, we just ramped up the regularity,” she says.

One of Odlum Brown’s biggest challenges was finding computer equipment for advisors who suddenly found themselves working from home, in particular monitors to use as second screens. It turns out many companies, across many sectors, were looking to buy the same products.

“The challenge was finding stores that still had them in stock,” she says, adding that they were able to source a large supply of monitors through an advisor’s connection.

For Montreal-based PWL Capital Inc., which has 26 advisors across four offices managing more than $4-billion in client assets, a challenge at the start of the pandemic was getting its telecommunications provider to boost its internet bandwidth to enable employees uninterrupted access to its virtual private network.

Telecom networks were under a huge strain when the pandemic first hit as so many companies were relying on remote access to support their at-home workforces.

“We’re not the Royal Bank, saying, ‘Improve our VPN.’” says Brenda Bartlett, PWL’s president and CEO. “Being a smaller firm, we don’t always get the telecom provider’s attention right away.”

It took a couple of weeks before their connection was smooth, “which seems like an eternity,” especially amid the market upheaval at the time.

PWL itself was well prepared for the pandemic, Ms. Bartlett says, having made a significant investment in its technology and infrastructure three years ago, including beefing up its remote access capabilities for advisors.

“We did it to ensure that our client-facing teams could go out and meet clients and be fully functional … and didn’t have to be nailed down to a chair at the office to get anything done,” she says.

“When COVID-19 hit, it was the best test of our business continuity plan. If it happened three years ago, I don’t think I could’ve made that statement. … I’m very proud of my team who mobilized to do everything to make it work,” she says. “From a client experience, it has been virtually seamless.”

Meanwhile, Dahlin Sabey, founder and CEO of Calgary-based Belay Wealth Inc., a mutual fund dealer with about 30 advisors across Canada who manage about $750-million in client assets, says the pandemic hasn’t had much of an impact on his firm’s operations. In part, that’s because Belay Wealth was created in late 2018 as a mostly digital firm relying on its own proprietary software platform to run client accounts.

“When COVID-19 hit, it didn’t actually change our operations at all [because] we were already 100 per cent online,” he says.

In addition, having a small team meant the firm didn’t need to implement blanket protocols. Instead, the dealer worked with advisors individually to come up with their own ways to do business safely.

For example, one advisor in Victoria purchased plexiglass screens to put between him and clients who still wanted to meet in person.

“Being a smaller firm, we know our advisors and what they need … instead of just sending out a memo to everyone to saying, ‘These are our rules,’” Mr. Sabey says.

He points out that these small-firm advantages have attracted more interest from outside advisors during the pandemic.

In normal times, Mr. Sabey says he’d receive about five calls a week from advisors potentially interested in joining his firm.

“Now, we’re fielding about 40 calls a week,” he says, many of which have been unhappy with how their larger firms have handled the pandemic.

Smaller firms can be more flexible and agile, including during times of crisis, he says. “That’s how we compete [with the bigger firms].”"

Trillions of dollars of monetary and economic stimulus aimed at reducing the economic fallout for tens of millions of Americans out of work because of the coronavirus have driven the S&P 500 up more than 50% from its March 23 low, with the benchmark now up nearly 5% for 2020.

While the pandemic has forced many restaurants and shops out of business, large supermarkets and retailers with strong online sales have grown. Thanks mostly to Amazon, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index has gained 23% in 2020, making it the second-strongest performer among 11 sector indexes, below technology.

The information technology index has jumped 25% year to date, lifted by Microsoft, Apple, Mastercard and other companies seeing stronger demand for their products and services as people staying at home do more shopping online.

While some investors worry that the rally since March has been concentrated largely among tech companies, others have confidence that these stocks’ gains are justified as the pandemic leads to a sharp increase in online shopping, cloud computing and other uses of technology.

“These are firms that have solid fundamentals that are superior to the broader market and will benefit from recent trends. We do not find that this high concentration is a source of systemic risk,” said Benjamin Jones, senior multi-asset strategist at State Street Global Markets.

With the U.S. corporate earnings season mostly completed, a record number of companies have beaten dramatically lowered estimates. But the second quarter is still set to be the low point for earnings this year.

Even after a recent modest improvement in profit estimates, the S&P 500 is trading at about 22 times expected earnings, its highest multiple since the dot com era two decades ago.

This should not be construed as an endorsement of the report’s recommendations. For more on The Globe’s disclaimers please read here. The following is excerpted from the report:

The last five months have been unprecedented within the global capital markets with historic volatility, a laser focus on the “COVID-19 economy” and myriad projections on how the world will look coming out of the pandemic. Many companies have been forced to rapidly adapt their business models to adjust to changing demand environments and new physical-distancing requirements, and these changes have become the focus for many investors over the last few months. That said, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most powerful trends within both Canadian and global capital markets was an increased focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices. We believe this trend is poised to accelerate.

Numerous studies have demonstrated how firms that score highly on an ESG framework tend to provide stronger shareholder returns over the long term. This, in our view, is reflective of the long-term view employed by many leaders in the ESG space, and the ability of these leaders to identify both longer-term potential risks and opportunities for growth and efficiencies. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a concrete example of why companies and investors have become more focused on longer-term risk mitigation and on a company’s ability to pivot its growth strategy based on a rapidly changing environment.

I asked Mr. Choi for a quick take on his view – thumbs up or down. “Huge thumbs up,” was his reply.

What a relief – not just for Aeroplan members, but everyone who collects reward points. The rebooting of Aeroplan shows that life as a points collector doesn’t have to be about takeaways.

The life cycle of a reward program is to start strong to attract members and then reduce benefits to improve profitability. But when the new Aeroplan relaunches on Nov. 8, it will be better. This revamp is a challenge to all the reward programs and credit cards out there. What improvements do they have to offer?

Story continues below advertisement

A big win for Aeroplan members in the reboot: All seats on Air Canada flights are available to book for Aeroplan rewards, including premium economy and business. Previously, there was a limited number of seats available for reward redemptions. Also, carrier surcharges that can cost hundreds of dollars disappear, although there’s a minor trade-off for this gain in a $39 booking fee for partner airlines. “I’d rather pay $39 than $900 to fly to Germany on points via Lufthansa,” Mr. Choi said by e-mail.

Now for an issue that is going to bug Aeroplan members hoping to book summer or holiday season travel – dynamic pricing. It means high-demand routes and travel dates will require a higher expenditure of points, while off-peak travel will cost less.

A few other notable points:

Existing Aeroplan miles will be accepted on a one-to-one basis (going forward, miles will be called points)

You can share points and benefits with family

There’s a new redemption chart spelling out the points required to fly between different points – Mr. Choi says there are some sweet spots that mean fewer points will be required.

Aeroplan.com will eventually be wound down and reservations will be made on aircanada.com

Rob’s personal finance reading list

Can the housing market stay hot?

Toronto Life asked seven experts for their view on the housing market – a mix of analysts, academics and housing industry people. The most optimistic views came from the housing industry people, which prompted a response on Twitter from Evan Siddall, president of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., a federal government agency that has a mandate to help Canadians access affordable housing. Here’s some good news for first-time buyers: The mortgage stress test you have to pass when qualifying to get a mortgage is about to ease a bit.

The new way to pay on the installment plan

Ask Rob

Q: In a recent column, you talked about balanced ETFs and published a list ranging from conservative to growth funds. You often talk about diversification. So why not invest in each of the balanced ETFs on your list? I am 68 years old and have $180,000 to invest.

A: Believe me, it’s much to your benefit to choose one suitable balanced ETF and leave it at that. These ETFs provide a fully diversified portfolio – exposure to thousands of individual stocks and bonds. You don’t need anything further, which means you limit your brokerage commissions for buying and selling ETFs and you limit the time needed to maintain the portfolio.

The Canada Revenue Agency expects online services to be fully restored by Wednesday after fraudsters used thousands of pilfered usernames and passwords to obtain government services.

About 5,600 CRA accounts were targeted in what the federal government describes as “credential stuffing” schemes, in which hackers used passwords and usernames from other websites to access Canadians’ revenue agency accounts.

The suspension of CRA’s online services comes as many Canadians are relying on the revenue agency’s website to access financial support related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

People can still apply for benefit programs including the Canada Emergency Student Benefit and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit by calling 1-800-959-8281, said Annette Butikofer, chief information officer of the revenue agency.

In addition, employers can apply for the latest wage subsidy as planned, she said during a briefing Monday on the cyberattacks.

“We know employers are counting on these funds.”

The government is advising Canadians to use unique passwords for all online accounts and to check for suspicious activity.

The Canada Revenue Agency expects its online services to be fully restored by Wednesday after fraudsters used thousands of stolen usernames and passwords to obtain government services. About 5,600 CRA accounts were targeted in what the federal government describes as ""credential stuffing"" schemes, in which the fraudsters use identifiers and passwords from other websites to access Canadians' accounts with the revenue agency. The Canadian Press

Federal officials have been grappling for the last week with the credential stuffing attacks, made possible through information that was previously stolen from non-government accounts.

The technique, often beginning with huge caches of usernames and passwords found in the darker reaches of the internet, takes advantage of peoples’ tendency to reuse passwords.

Fraudsters then use automated web bots to hammer websites with various credentials until they hit upon the right combination and get in, said Marc Brouillard, acting chief information officer of Canada.

Story continues below advertisement

Once in, the attacker can take over these accounts and steal personal information or undertake activities as that user, he told the briefing.

The first of three attacks in the last week took aim at the GCKey service, which is used by about 30 federal departments and allows Canadians to access services like the My Service Canada account.

By using the previously stolen usernames and passwords, the perpetrators were able to fraudulently acquire about 9,000 of the some 12 million GCKey accounts, one-third of which accessed federal services and are being further examined for suspicious activities, Mr. Brouillard said.

Affected GCKey accounts were cancelled, and the government is contacting users whose credentials were compromised with instructions on how to obtain a new GCKey.

Separately, CRA’s system was hit by credential stuffing attacks. The perpetrators were able to use previously hacked credentials to access the CRA portal. They were also able to exploit a vulnerability that allowed them to bypass the CRA security questions and get into thousands more accounts.

In addition, early Saturday morning, the CRA portal was directly targeted with a large amount of traffic trying to attack the services through credential stuffing.

“Out of an abundance of caution the CRA portal was shut down to contain the attack and implement measures to protect CRA services,” Mr. Brouillard said.

Credential stuffers are difficult to detect because they are not trying to sneak through a back door, he said.

“They are applying credentials just like normal users. So it’s very hard to detect that pattern from all of the good traffic. But we have systems to monitor and look for these behaviours and identify when patterns don’t seem to make sense and that’s how this particular [attack] was identified.”

The government is looking at greater use of two-factor authentication, where a user trying to log in to a system enters not only a password but receives a message with a code or link they must act on before being allowed in.

But putting this in place for all programs could be challenging, Mr. Brouillard suggested.

“We also have to worry about making our systems accessible and easy to use, so it is a balancing act,” he said. “We’re looking at ways of strengthening our systems to be able to address these issues.”

Several federal agencies are investigating the incidents and since their work is ongoing, nothing will be said about the suspected perpetrators, said Scott Jones, head of Canadian Centre for Cyber Security.

The RCMP was notified of unusual activity Tues., Aug. 11, Ms. sButikofer said.

“The confidence and trust that individuals and businesses have in the CRA are the cornerstones of Canada’s tax system,” she said.

She said the revenue agency’s teams have been “working around the clock to resolve these issues and protect the confidential information of Canadians.”

Accounts of affected individuals have been revoked and letters have been sent to these people, she added.

Asked during the briefing if the government would apologize, Mr. Brouillard sidestepped the question.

“It’s not a matter of being sorry or not sorry,” he said. “Of course, this is not something we want to happen. But we are reacting to those attackers and addressing them and mitigating those services as much as possible. And that does include supporting Canadians.”

An expression of regret did, however, come from Lori MacDonald, chief operating officer at Service Canada.

“Certainly we apologize for any inconvenience on behalf of the government of Canada caused to any of our clients,” she told the briefing.

All CRA My Account users are encouraged, once services have been reactivated, to enable e-mail notifications as a security measure, Butikofer said. This allows taxpayers to be contacted by e-mail if their address or direct-deposit information has been changed on CRA records.

“These notifications act as an early warning to Canadians of potentially fraudulent activity on their accounts.”

When Ontario schoolchildren head back to school this fall, they will for the first time be learning everyday financial skills such as how to e-transfer money, the ins and outs of compounding interest, how to determine the cost of loans and lines of credit, and – certified financial planners rejoice – planning for and reaching financial goals. Following the financial literacy guidelines, children in Ontario may actually gain the rudimentary financial planning skills needed to earn, spend and save wisely into adulthood.

That is, if everything goes according to plan. But that’s a big “if.” Even without the questionable timing of rolling out a new plan during a pandemic that could possibly unleash a second wave come fall, there is precedence showing that introducing mandatory financial literacy comes with challenges.

Story continues below advertisement

The elementary math update – the first since 2005 – comes one year after the province’s newly revised curriculum for the Grade 10 career studies course. That rollout has been problematic from the start, say some experts.

Launched July 2, 2019, and implemented last fall, the half-credit course represents the first time a financial literacy component has been mandatory in Ontario high schools, rather than merely slipped into elective business or accounting classes.

For Fred Masters, now a retired senior finance teacher at Resurrection Catholic Secondary School in Kitchener, Ont., that 2019 curriculum change – a culmination of countless meetings since 2016 and 29 pilot projects involving hundreds of students – meant an exciting opportunity for young people to learn real-world money management skills at school.

He should know. Before leaving teaching in 2018, Mr. Masters ran a lunchtime personal finance club for students.

“I didn’t know if anyone would give up their lunch period and listen to a teacher talk about money,” he says now. “And they came in waves. The sessions were packed. It was standing room only. Even the staff started to come.”

Now Mr. Masters is a financial literacy presenter, so when his former school board asked him last summer to create the teacher resource package for the financial literacy portion of the revised careers course, he wasn’t surprised. What did shock him was the curriculum document he had to work from.

“There were 19 course expectations in the new careers course, and only three dealt with financial literacy,” he says. “So that was just a huge missed opportunity for all students to learn key skills foundational for a successful life.”

Story continues below advertisement

What’s more, much of the financial literacy portion of the new course focuses on developing a post-high-school budget, leaving only five or six remaining hours to teach everything else. Fortunately, budgeting will be covered in Grade 8, according to the new elementary curriculum, so one hopes the students will already have basic knowledge to draw from.

Stacy Yanchuk Oleksy, director of education and community awareness for the Credit Counselling Society in Toronto, says the new high-school curriculum is a start, but would also like to see it cover topics such as how to pay bills and taxes. In other words, the boring but useful stuff – a deeper dive into what students will soon be expected to learn in grade school.

“As much as I appreciate Pythagorean theorem, I haven’t really used it too much in my everyday life,” she says. “We need to teach students really basic life skills so when they get into the world of work, they’re better prepared.”





The wish list

Fred Masters, a retired senior finance teacher and president of Masters Money Management, developed a teacher resource package for the new mandatory Grade 10 career studies course. Although the curriculum is a first step in helping students become financially literate in high school, he would like to see three further changes:

Make it mandatory for every high-school student in Ontario to take a business course before graduation. Much of the material the new Grade 10 course is missing can often be found in business classes right now. Embed financial literacy into one strand of every high-school math course. (Practical lessons in math? Bring them on.) Every student must take one personal finance course in college or university. At that age, they’re ripe to learn real-world lessons.

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way people work, made “secure” jobs insecure and exposed corporate weaknesses – all of which is prompting some Canadians to rethink their careers. That provides a relationship-building opportunity for financial advisors to help their clients decide whether to risk jumping ship in the middle of an economic storm and – if they make that leap – to work with them to protect their finances.

“What’s happening with the labour market is causing the relationship between employers and employees or contractors to be reimagined,” says Carolyn Levy, president of Randstad Technologies at Randstad Canada, the Canadian division of the global staffing, recruitment and employment services firm, in Calgary.

“In a wonderful way, there’s actually a lot of opportunity ahead for people who maybe wouldn’t have considered working in some organizations … because of the commute or because of the flexibility that they might need,” she adds.

Story continues below advertisement

The stigma associated with working from home and connecting remotely to meetings is fading because so many people have had to make the shift to a home office – and this new reality has also given some people more time to reflect on whether they’re in the right jobs and at the right companies, Ms. Levy says.

There are hints of employee discontent in the June edition of the Randstad Workmonitor Global Report, which was based on a survey conducted in May.

While 90 per cent of Canadian survey participants said they had adapted to their new pandemic-influenced working situation, just 77 per cent thought their employer was looking after their well-being through the pandemic and 61 per cent reported that the pandemic has had a negative impact on their job.

In addition, Canadian survey participants said their employers were placing increased demands on them, as 55 per cent said employers expect staff to make themselves available outside regular working hours – almost 12 percentage points higher than in November 2019.

However, Kurt Rosentreter, portfolio manager and senior financial advisor with Manulife Securities in Toronto, warns that clients considering a career switch in the current environment need to be extremely cautious.

“We could be on the cusp of the biggest recession we’ve seen in 20 years,” he warns. “If unemployment goes from 4 per cent to 12 per cent, you don’t want to be quitting your job right now.”

That said, Mr. Rosentreter has some younger clients who have suggested they may want to start talking about a potential career change later this year depending on how the next few months play out. He thinks it’s important to walk clients through a cost-benefit analysis. Factors to consider include the expenses associated with retraining, whether there will be a period of reduced or no income, what workplace benefits and insurance protection they’re giving up, and what income and benefits the new career offers.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Rosentreter says it’s also critical to evaluate the potential impact that a change of career could have on a client’s current financial plan.

“If you’re going to do a restart or even a pause, both will have an implication on your longer-term goals. Is that also in your vision of an acceptable range of possibilities?” he asks his clients – and he reminds them to involve their partner, if they have one, in the decision-making process.

For Patti Dolan, portfolio manager with Mission Wealth Advisors at Raymond James Ltd., career transitions among clients aren’t a new trend. She’s located in Calgary, where a downturn in the oil and gas sector in the past few years was prompting professionals to go back to school and change careers well before COVID-19 came along. Now, the pandemic is another factor making people re-evaluate their professions, she says.

Ms. Dolan says it’s important to help clients realize and prepare for the immediate financial and real-life implications of making such a change.

“They need to look at how they could carry themselves financially for the next two to four years if they’re looking at going back to school,” she says. “If they’re transitioning into another job or another career path, are they going to be taking a salary cut? And how long will it take to build that up again?”

Clients also need to ask themselves, “What if this doesn’t work out? What would I do next?” Ms. Dolan says.

Ron Harvey, senior financial advisor at IPC Investment Corp. in Ottawa, has learned to be strategic about scheduling video calls with clients and colleagues while working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.

He only schedules two or three video meetings a day between Tuesdays and Thursdays and reserves Mondays and Fridays for administrative tasks and to catch up on his work.

Limiting the number of video calls he takes per week has worked wonders for curbing virtual meeting fatigue, more commonly known as “Zoom fatigue,” a form of burnout unique to conversing through a screen, Mr. Harvey says. Compared with face-to-face discussions, virtual meetings typically require more attention to pick up on non-verbal cues, allow greater room for distraction and increase our self-consciousness over our own image in the corner of the screen.

Story continues below advertisement

“I find it helps a lot,” he says of his scheduling tactics, noting that his clients are generally amenable to these parameters as well. (His assistant, who typically schedules his calls, always offers clients three or four available meeting slots, which has proven effective.)

Zoom fatigue is by no means unique to the financial services industry. Workers across all industries are tiring from endless screen-to-screen contact. But for many advisors, virtual meetings are inescapable. With increasingly volatile markets and clients in distress, the past few months have required new levels of remote meetings – and that has left advisors with no choice but to take them on.

Mr. Harvey suggests that advisors struggling with virtual meeting fatigue experiment with their schedule and stick to whatever works. For example, he’s also found success in leaving windows of time before and after each meeting to do preparation and follow-up work.

Without the burden of a commute, he also starts his work-from-home days slightly earlier than normal, logging in at 8 a.m. and logging out by 4:30 p.m. He fills his calendar with opportunities to take breaks and go for walks, which keeps him from spending hours on end in front of the screen.

He also strives to keep his client meetings as focused as possible to limit the amount of time doing video calls. He writes an agenda, sends it to clients a few days in advance and sticks to it during the meeting.

“The client and I have a structured meeting; that’s how I think other advisors who are concerned about spending all their time on a computer screen [can avoid fatigue],” Mr. Harvey says.

Domenic Gallippi, regional director at Russell Investments Canada Ltd. in Toronto, takes a similar approach. He does upfront prep work to ensure that his meetings are “ultra-effective” and efficient. Attendees receive an agenda a few days prior, during which they can ask questions and or add items to the to-do list. Everyone knows going into the meeting what it’s for and all have the chance to make the most of the conversation.

Story continues below advertisement

“We’re trying to avoid having those lumpy days during which you have, you know, 10 Zoom meetings and then you don’t have any for the next three days,” he says. “How you deliver a solid 15- to 30-minute conversation [when] by the time you’re at your sixth or seventh [videoconferencing meeting] of the day, you feel like or sound like a robot.”

Mr. Gallippi says that sending preparatory material to clients in advance of virtual meetings can also help earn back the trust that’s so often eroded without face-to-face contact. Research on “computer-mediated communication” shows that non-verbal cues are an essential part of establishing a sense of rapport with another person; while videoconferencing is an alternative to face-to-face communication, it’s not an entirely effective for the purposes of building client trust.

“Anytime that you take away the in-person interaction, it makes something a little bit more challenging. For a lot of people, the in-person interaction is what is what cements the trust in the relationship,” Mr. Gallippi says.

He strives to make up for this by showing the others on the call that he’s done his homework before meeting with them.

“[Make] sure that your audience understands there’s a level of preparation that you put into the meeting,” Gallippi says. “Something as simple as the calendar invitation. … If you have a copy of the deck ready, or whatever it is that you’re going to be sharing ... I think goes a long way in terms of them believing you’re a subject matter expert.”

Mr. Gallippi’s colleague, Julie Zhang, Russell Investments’ director of North America sales in Seattle, says she’s learned to treat Zoom fatigue the same way she treats other forms of fatigue.

When life went into lockdown in March, she quickly grew overconfident about the efficiency of virtual meetings and packed “easily … 10 to 12 meetings a day,” into her schedule, all taking place over Zoom.

“At the end of March, I was like, ‘I can’t do this, I’m exhausted,’” Ms. Zhang says. She found relief in being more mindful about her schedule – respecting when certain matters could be kept to e-mail and working breaks into her day to step away from the screen.

Mr. Harvey echoes the sentiment, acknowledging that it can be difficult, at times, to respect breaks for what they are. Be disciplined about it if you have to, he suggests.

“Don’t spend all of your downtime reading articles online,” he says. “That’s how you can get yourself too glued to the screen at all times.”"

When the COVID-19 crisis first hit, it changed many people’s day-to-day realities and cast their futures into uncertainty, making it difficult for them to focus on distant goals. But now that the initial shock has passed, financial advisors say clients are once again starting to discuss their long-term plans.

“There were a few months there in which the whole notion of the future felt like it was just not relevant,” says Karin Mizgala, co-founder and chief executive officer of Money Coaches Canada in Vancouver. “There was more focus on the immediacy of, ‘Are my investments still okay?’ ‘Do I still have a job?’ ‘What does this mean to my family?’ [and] trying to get organized with the kids and parents at home.”

However, she says that through June and into July, her firm’s website has seen an uptick in inquiries about retirement planning to almost double historical numbers.

“It feels like we’re now moving into a new phase in which people are starting to think about what impact COVID-19 and the financial markets are having on their life and on their future,” Ms. Mizgala says. “COVID-19 has forced us to really think about what’s important to us, what’s meaningful, what our values and goals are.”

As clients pay renewed attention to their goals and, in some cases, begin to change them – for example, she says several of her clients are now more focused on charitable giving – advisors can check in to make sure those goals are meaningful, measurable and achievable.

Ms. Mizgala teases out her clients’ goals by asking open-ended questions, engaging in active listening and reflecting client answers back to them.

“It’s a back-and-forth dialogue that ultimately helps them and helps us hone in on the direction that they want to go in and, of course, where they’re at now. Then, the planning process fills in the gaps of laying out what the various options are and scenarios that can help them achieve those goals,” she says. “The beautiful thing about planning and working with a financial planner is that you can put pen to paper on any idea without having to actually execute on it until you look at the pros and cons.”

Nicole Ewing, Canadian strategist, client needs research, at Edward Jones in Ottawa, also says it’s important to dig deeper to get a clear picture of a client’s goals.

“Many clients default to, ‘Well, I want to retire,’” she says. Asking probing questions like the following can help make that more specific: “What does that look like? Does retirement mean financial freedom? Does it mean a particular age? Does it mean a particular income level at that point? Having a dialogue about it definitely helps define the goals better.”

In addition, Ms. Ewing sees clients’ shorter-term, more immediate concerns as a potential jumping-off point that can broaden conversations about longer-term planning and introduce new goals clients may not have considered.

For example, she says many clients are focused on staying healthy right now, so perhaps it’s a good time to discuss how to manage the financial repercussions of health challenges in the future. Similarly, with some clients concerned about downward pressure on real estate values, it may be appropriate to talk about how to make retirement plans less vulnerable to fluctuations in the real estate market.

“We can’t control some of the events that might happen to us during our lifetimes, but we can plan for them and take the opportunity of what we’re experiencing now to think about how it might impact us later,” Ms. Ewing says. “Focusing on goals allows us to look forward to that future, and building that foundation now allows us to work toward that. For a lot of people, focusing on goals provides comfort and a feeling of hope.”

While in-depth conversations are one way to zero in on a client’s goals, a recent Morningstar Inc. study titled “Mining for Goals,” suggests that providing clients with a menu of choices can help significantly, too. According to the study, 73 per cent of survey participants changed one of the three top goals they had shared with the researchers after they saw a standardized master list of 17 potential goals.

“[We asked the study’s participants] two very straightforward questions – Why are you doing this? What are you aspiring to? – and many of the answers they give right off the top of their heads turn out to be not very reliable,” says Ryan Murphy, head of decisions sciences at Morningstar Investment Management in Chicago.

“[But] just giving people a little bit more time and space and a structured process to think through what their motivations and what their preferences are can help them identify and communicate those better. That really helps the advising process and helps people develop a financial plan that serves their long-term best interests,” he adds.

Starting with a list may be more important than ever in the current environment.

“There’s good evidence that shows during times of heightened stress and uncertainty, people’s attention narrows, their focus on the here and now is amplified, and it gets harder to think about the abstract or the more distant future,” Mr. Murphy says.

Whether clients are still in crisis mode or emerging from it, Mr. Murphy says that, “good financial planners are able to help their clients articulate and understand their reasons for investing – what their goals are – and then make sure that their financial plans, their asset allocations, the details of investing match up nicely to serving those long-term goals.”"

When financial advisors bring up philanthropic giving as part of a holistic wealth management strategy for clients, those advisors’ own charitable involvement can often arise. That provides advisors an opportunity to share their values and lead by example.

Many are charitably inclined and donate either their time or their money for worthy causes. But it can be challenging for advisors to bring up the conversation around strategic charitable giving strategies out of the blue when discussing investments or other financial matters, says Jeremy Hampson, senior wealth advisor at Assante Capital Management Ltd. in Montreal.

“If you’ve never spoken to your clients about charity and they come in and think they’re going to have a meeting to discuss their wills or their portfolios and you start [the conversation] with, ‘Have you ever thought about giving away half your estate?’ It’s not going to go very well,” he says.

One way to start the conversation is by looking at the charitable donations that clients included on their annual tax returns or by inquiring about their participation in fundraisers they may happen to be involved with, he says. Then, clients will often also ask about an advisor’s volunteer or philanthropic activity, which can help create that connection on the subject.

Mr. Hampson’s story with charities goes back almost 50 years, as his family was involved in grassroots organizations to support his sister with special needs. As an advisor, he began giving presentations on planning for special needs families, which led to fundraising and involvement with boards. He’s currently president of West Island Association for the Intellectually Handicapped, a charity in Montreal that assists people with intellectual disabilities, autism and their families.

Discussing his own charitable involvement usually leads to a larger conversation about philanthropy and ultimately strengthens the advisor-client relationship, Mr. Hampson says.

“[Clients then begin] to understand what makes me tick and what I’m passionate about,” he says. “It humanizes who I am and what I’m doing, so it just really adds another dimension to that relationship.”

Not only is it helpful for advisors who discuss philanthropy with clients to lead by example, but as a matter of integrity, it’s critically important for them to be engaged in and passionate about their own charitable activities, says Keith Thomson, founding partner and managing director at Stonegate Private Counsel in Toronto, a division of CI Private Counsel LP.

“There are two ways to give, with time and [money], and for advisors to be walking the talk, they should be doing both,” says Mr. Thomson, who’s on the board of directors for the Canadian Association of Gift Planners.

Invariably, Mr. Thomson says clients will ask him about the charities to which he gives and works with during conversations about their charitable interests. He takes these opportunities to discuss his philanthropic journey, which spans almost 30 years, including serving on the boards of organizations like the Toronto Foundation and AMREF Health Africa in Canada.

“It’s a wonderful conversation that’s not about money. It’s about what they can do with their money to make the world a better place,” Mr. Thomson says.

Although philanthropy comes up in the context of estate planning with older clients who have accumulated wealth, Linda Shick, senior vice-president and portfolio manager, private client group, at Raymond James Ltd.’s Family Wealth Counsel Advisory Group in Toronto, says giving back is also particularly important for those in the younger demographic who have been involved in charities while they were in school.

“[Younger] people who have been referred to me check out [my] website and one of the things they say is [that my] community involvement is important [to them],” says Ms. Shick, who is a member of the Raymond James Canada Foundation advisory committee and serves on the board of directors at the St. Felix Centre in Toronto.

Indeed, according to the Case Foundation’s final Millennial Impact Report, which was released in 2019 and included analysis from a decade of surveying more than 150,000 U.S. millennials on how they interact with causes, this cohort makes philanthropic decisions based on personal connections and moves toward greater activism as they age.

“They can actually pick their advisors based on community involvement. So, I think that’s actually going to get more important as this generation builds wealth,” Ms. Shick says.

Ultimately, advisors looking to become more involved in philanthropy and giving back should consider causes or organizations with which they feel a personal connection and seek further information from not-for-profit professionals, Mr. Hampson says.

“Even if you don’t have the time to volunteer, then pick up the phone and have a conversation with the executive director of that place and find out what they’re looking for,” he adds.

With many fundraisers cancelled this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, this is an ideal time for advisors to reach out and ask how they could help. (According to Imagine Canada’s Sector Monitor charities report published in May, almost three-quarters of charities reported a decline in at least one form of donations, with events-based fundraising affected most significantly.)

“A lot of advisors are really savvy when it comes to marketing and [developing] business opportunities, and that’s exactly what charities need the most help with right now – strategic thinking and fundraising capabilities,” Mr. Thomson says.

“For those advisors who are willing to volunteer time and money, this is the time to do it,” he adds."

The number of sustainable investment products and assets under management (AUM) have continued to grow during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing more options for financial advisors looking to add responsible investments to their clients’ portfolios.

Sustainable investments – which include investment funds focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors or companies making an impact in specific areas such as diversity and inclusion or climate change – have reached about $8.8-billion in AUM in Canada in 92 funds (excluding fund of funds) as of June 30, according to data from Morningstar Canada. That’s up 13 per cent from $7.8-billion, or 72 funds, as of Dec. 31, 2019.

The majority of sustainable investment funds in Canada, or 63 of the 88 that Morningstar Canada tracks, have also outperformed their peers for the first half of the year, “providing an acute observation that investing sustainably does not necessarily come at the expense of returns,” says Ian Tam, director of investment research at the Toronto-based firm.

Morningstar Canada’s research conducted over the past decade shows that sustainable investing “is not detrimental to investor outcomes,” Mr. Tam says, despite concern among some investors that responsible investing means sacrificing returns.

For advisors, the challenge is determining which type of sustainable investments are best suited to their clients, such as a fossil-fuel-free fund or something with a broader ESG mandate. Then, advisors need to ensure that the investments they choose are in areas they believe will perform well in the long term and aren’t a short-term fad that may fade quickly.

“We spend a lot of time thinking about themes versus trends,” says Martin Grosskopf, vice-president and portfolio manager, sustainable investing, at AGF Investments Inc. in Toronto, who manages AGF Global Sustainable Growth Equity Fund. “Trends you want to be careful about, themes you want to invest in … [because] themes won’t dissipate over time.”

Examples of longer-term sustainability themes include clean energy, carbon reduction and waste management, Mr. Grosskopf says.

Specifically, he points to well-known renewable energy companies such as Brookfield Renewable Partners LP (BEP-UN-T), which he holds in the AGF fund, as well as Innergex Renewable Energy Inc. (INE-T), Northland Power Inc. (NPI-T) and Algonquin Power and Utilities Corp. (AQN-T).

“These [companies] are solid, long-term opportunities,” Mr. Grosskopf says. “For some [investors], they were considered too boring to own. [But] these companies generate very good yield on long-term contracts and their opportunities are growing because their cost of capital is coming down.”

There’s also more investments in renewable projects, he says, “driven by government objectives and corporate decarbonization efforts.”

The AGF fund also holds other environmentally friendly companies that are part of the trend toward carbon and waste reduction, including Ecolab Inc. (ECL-N), which provides water and energy technologies and services, as well as Trex Co. Inc. (TREX-N), which recycles plastics bags and turns them into composite decking products.

“I would encourage [advisors] to look at these areas as long-term opportunities,” Mr. Grosskopf says of sustainable investing themes, in general.

Tim Nash, an independent investment coach at Good Investing in Toronto, says diversity and inclusion – which fall under the “S” and “G” part of ESG investing – are also expected to be important sustainable investing themes in the years to come.

He says more companies are making commitments to do better in this area, particularly in the wake of the social unrest following the police killing of George Floyd in the U.S.

The COVID-19 crisis has also highlighted income and health inequalities that exist in many countries around the world.

“[These events] have put a magnifying glass on the inequities that exist in our society,” Mr. Nash says. “People are saying, ‘Enough.’ It’s a bit of a breaking point.”

Companies are being forced to respond to calls for social justice, and Mr. Nash says investors are watching. And those that take action are more likely to outperform their peers who do little or nothing, over the long term.

Still, he cautions advisors and investors to do their homework on investments that claim to be ESG friendly. Some investment funds may not live up to their claims, while others may turn out to not fit investors’ values in other areas. For example, an ESG fund might hold gun, tobacco or gambling stocks, which an investor may be opposed to.

“It’s not always transparent,” Mr. Nash says. “It’s up to investors and advisors to do their due diligence and look under the hood of these products because they are different and use different methodologies. Also, look at the companies that are inside.”"

President Donald Trump is eyeing a White House funeral service later this week for his younger brother, Robert, who died over the weekend in a New York hospital.

“We’re looking at Friday. And we may do just a small service right here at the White House,” Trump told reporters Monday as he departed Washington on a trip to the Midwest.

The president said such a service would be a “great honour” for his sibling.

“I think he’d be greatly honoured. He loves our country. He loved our country so much. He was so proud of what we were doing and what we are doing for our country,” Trump said.

Robert Trump, a businessman, died Saturday after being hospitalized in New York. He was 71.

President Trump announced his brother’s death in a statement Saturday that referred to his sibling as “my best friend” and promised they “will meet again.”

Trump had visited his brother in the hospital on Friday; White House officials had described him as seriously ill. The cause of death has not been released.

Trump discussed his brother’s death during a nationally broadcast interview Monday.

“This was not a great weekend. It’s very hard. You knew it was going to happen, but still when it happens it’s a very tough thing,” the president said on Fox News Channel’s “Fox and Friends.” “He was a great guy. He was a tremendous guy. He was my friend. I guess they say best friend, and that’s true. And losing him, not easy.”

Trump said Robert Trump had always supported him and there was no rivalry between them.

Health care workers fighting coronavirus in dozens of countries are facing violence from fearful communities who have attacked doctors and burned down clinics, aid agencies said on Tuesday.

In Colombia, ambulances were blocked from entering a town to screen for COVID-19 cases, said the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which recorded 611 incidents targeting health workers, patients and facilities from February to July.

In South Africa, a testing station and a clinic were torched by people who did not want responders in their neighbourhood, said medical charity Médecins sans frontières (Doctors Without Borders).

“It’s a byproduct of the new, novel, infectious disease – there’s a lot of fear,” said Sean Christie, a spokesman for MSF in South Africa.

“Even for areas that have experienced very big HIV and TB epidemics, this was just different. The media response was so overwhelming, and [there is] so much social media misinformation,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Although governments and charities have launched information campaigns, more work is needed to address fake news, make sure people have access to the facts and include local communities in decision-making, aid workers said.

Drawing on first-hand accounts and media reports, the ICRC said incidents – including physical attacks, verbal harassment and threats – took place in more than 40 countries including Afghanistan, Bangladesh and the Philippines.

The real figure was likely much higher, the global humanitarian agency said.

“Fear of contracting the disease and the lack of basic knowledge concerning COVID-19 are often the underlying reasons behind violent acts,” said Esperanza Martinez, the ICRC’s head of health.

“To protect health care staff, medical facilities and patients from violence, it is of paramount importance to disseminate accurate information,” she said in a statement.

Some of the most common beliefs are that coronavirus is man-made, that it is not real, or that new testing facilities or health centres will bring it to communities.

Some people in Haiti believe hospital patients are given a deadly injection to increase the number of coronavirus deaths so that the government can attract more aid, according to one community leader.

In Gambia, there have been no attacks but people are avoiding health facilities out of fear and trying to self-diagnose their illnesses, said Baba Balajo, a program manager for the humanitarian agency Catholic Relief Services.

“We have had people expressing the fear that nowadays when you go to the health facilities you are always diagnosed with COVID,” he said.

“It’s a problem because people now resort to going to pharmacies, and that may not resolve their health problems.”

The World Health Organization has said it is concerned that the coronavirus spread is being driven by people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, many of whom are unaware they have been infected, posing a danger to vulnerable groups. Reuters

A Zimbabwean magistrate Tuesday barred Beatrice Mtetwa, a top human rights lawyer, from representing a jailed journalist and ordered that she be prosecuted for comments posted on a Facebook page run by an American filmmaker.

Magistrate Ngoni Nduna also said he will forward his ruling to the Law Society of Zimbabwe for possible further punishment of the lawyer.

Mtetwa was representing Hopewell Chin’ono, an investigative journalist who has reported alleged government corruption on Twitter and has been in jail for more than three weeks on accusations of mobilizing an anti-government protest.

Prosecutors in Chin’ono’s bail case last week asked the magistrate to order Mtetwa to step down, arguing that she had posted on a Facebook page called “Beatrice Mtetwa and the Rule of Law” proceedings that were held in camera.

The allegedly offensive posts called on the international community to speak out against Chin’ono’s imprisonment.

Chin’ono told the court that Mtetwa had nothing to with the page. He said it was administered by an American filmmaker who produced a documentary by the name of the Facebook page, where people regularly post on human rights issues in Zimbabwe.

On Tuesday, the magistrate agreed with the prosecution and also ordered that Mtetwa should be charged with contempt of court.

Mtetwa has over the past decades represented dozens of journalists, human rights campaigners and opposition leaders accused of plotting against the government. She also frequently speaks against human rights abuses in the troubled southern African country.

She has been arrested, detained and allegedly assaulted by police in a pattern of harassment and intimidation.

Mtetwa said Tuesday’s ruling was meant to instill fear in human rights lawyers and could have the “chilling effect” of dissuading young lawyers from taking on human rights issues.

“The intention is to stop us defending a certain type of client it means the right to legal representation has been severely curtailed and it has been curtailed by the courts,” she told reporters outside the court. She said she will appeal the ruling.

The United States and Russia concluded two days of arms control talks Tuesday with the two sides still at odds over the U.S. demand to include China in any new treaty but showing signs of a possible willingness to extend the existing New START deal, which expires next year.

U.S. negotiator Marshall Billingslea told reporters after the talks in Vienna ended that “there are some areas of convergence between Russia and the United States, but we do remain far apart on a number of key issues.”

The U.S. argues that any new nuclear arms limitation treaty should cover all types of warheads, include better verification protocols and transparency measures, and be extended to include China, which has been increasing its own arsenal.

China has rejected the idea as an American ploy to avoid a new deal and said that it would gladly participate if the U.S. would agree to nuclear parity among all nations. China was invited to participate in the Vienna talks but did not send a delegation.

Russia, meanwhile, has said that if China is part of a new treaty, Britain and France should also be included.

The Russian representative to international organizations in Vienna, ambassador Mikhail Ulyanov, tweeted a comment from Russia’s negotiator saying that due to the “non-readiness” of the two western European countries to join a new arms pact, the “U.S. and Russia should concentrate on [the] bilateral track.”

The New START treaty was signed in 2010 by then-U.S. president Barack Obama and then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev. The pact limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers.

After both Moscow and Washington withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty last year, New START is the only remaining nuclear arms control deal between the two countries. It’s set to expire in February, 2021, unless the parties agree to extend it for another five years.

Russia has offered an extension without any conditions. Mr. Billingslea indicated the U.S. was willing to talk about an extension but only if there were a politically binding framework for making changes to New START, which he called “deeply flawed.”

Mr. Billingslea said modifications were needed to the exchange of telemetry information – the data generated during missile flight tests – and to address how quickly inspectors could be sent to a site, and the frequency of inspections, among other issues.

He said the agreement would also have to cover all nuclear warheads, including the short-range and tactical-range missiles being built by Russia.

“If we can fix these things, and if we can address all warheads, and if we do so in a way that’s extendable to China, ultimately, then we would be prepared,” Mr. Billingslea said. “Again, it’s [U.S. President Donald] Trump’s decision. We’re not going to take a bad deal back to him, but we would recommend that we consider, that he consider, an extension of the New START treaty this year.”

Commenting on the prospects of the pact’s extension, Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov, who led Russia’s delegation to the Vienna talks, said “the chances aren’t great, but they still haven’t dried up yet,” according to the Interfax news agency.

A follow-up meeting has not yet been scheduled. Mr. Billingslea said one could take place in as little as two weeks but that “the ball is in Russia’s court; we’ve signalled what we need to see.”

“We have a mandate from President Trump, and it’s going to be important that the next meeting the Russian delegation also have the same mandate,” he said. “I think our two leaders really have had all the necessary discussions to get there.”

Poland’s Health Minister Lukasz Szumowski said on Tuesday he was resigning from his post, the second resignation in two days from the ministry, which has faced growing criticism for its handling of the coronavirus crisis.

Szumowski’s approach in the early stages of the pandemic made him Poland’s most trusted politician in April, but his image has been dented by scandals surrounding the purchase of ventilators and masks.

Szumowski has denied any wrongdoing.

“I would like to inform you that today I am resigning … I decided it was that time,” he told a news conference, adding that he had initially planned to resign early this year but had stayed on to deal with the developing crisis.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki later on Tuesday said that he would announce the new health minister’s name by the end of the week.

The announcement came a day after Deputy Health Minister Janusz Cieszynski announced he was leaving the ministry.

Both Szumowski and Cieszynski had faced calls to quit over alleged irregularities in buying masks and purchases of ventilators which did not arrive.

Poland has seen a spike in coronavirus cases in recent weeks, driven in part by outbreaks among coal miners.

Jets believed to be Russian bombed several towns in rebel-held northwestern Syria in a new flare-up of violence since a Turkish-Russian deal that halted major fighting nearly six months ago, witnesses said.

Also on Tuesday, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying a Russian major-general died and three other servicemen were injured after a bomb exploded in the path of a Russian military convoy near Deir al Zor.

War planes flying at high altitude, which tracking centres said were Russian Sukhoi jets, dropped bombs on the Harbanoush and Sheikh Bahr Nahr areas where makeshift camps house tens of thousands of displaced families.

“There were over 20 raids we have monitored by Russian jets stationed in Hmeimim air base,” said Abdullah Sawan, a volunteer plane spotter whose network covers the Russian air base in the western coastal province of Latakia.

Russian jets this month bombed mountainous areas in Latakia where rebel fighters are dug in and civil defence witnesses said jets struck a camp for displaced people near the town of Binish in Idlib province that killed at least three civilians.

Russian jets in June made the first air strikes since the deal brokered in March between Russia, which backs Syrian President Bashar al Assad’s forces, and Turkey, which supports opposition fighters.

Rebels say the Syrian army and its allied militias were amassing troops on front lines.

There was no immediate comment from Moscow nor the Syrian army who accuse militant groups of wrecking the deal and deny any indiscriminate attacks on civilians.

Russia said last week the joint military patrols in Idlib, carried out along the M4 highway linking Syria’s east and west, had been suspended over increasing militant attacks in the area.

The March deal ended a Russian-backed bombing campaign that had displaced over a million people in the region which borders Turkey after months of fighting that killed hundreds.

Residents also said the jet strikes coincided with heavy artillery shelling by the Syrian army of several villages in Jabal al Zawya in southern Idlib.

Moscow has established a major presence in Syria where its airforce and military bases across the country have allowed Syrian President Bashar al Assad in recent years to defeat rebels who rose up against his authoritarian rule.

The British government announced Tuesday it is scrapping a public health agency that has taken blame for the country’s uneven response to the coronavirus.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the work of Public Health England will become part of a new body, the National Institute for Health Protection, which will guard against infectious diseases and biosecurity threats.

“We did not go into this crisis with the capacity for a response to a once-in-a-century-scale event,” Hancock said during a speech in London.

He said the new body would “bring together the science and the scale into one coherent whole.”

The new institute will be headed by Dido Harding, a former telecoms executive who leads the much-criticized test and trace program set up in recent months to help contain COVID-19.

Hancock said it would learn from public health agencies in South Korea and Germany, which have been praised for their strong response to the pandemic.

Public Health England has been criticized for taking an overly centralized approach to testing and contact-tracing, and of abandoning widespread testing for the virus in mid-March because it lacked the diagnostic capacity.

Its defenders argue that Britain’s Conservative governments have been cutting public health budgets for years, leaving the country ill-prepared to deal with the pandemic.

Jonathan Bell, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said Britain’s initial response to COVID-19 “did appear disjointed and insufficient.” But he said preparing for a possible second wave would be better done by “strengthening the systems we have now” rather than setting up new structures.

The French government plans to make wearing a mask compulsory in the vast majority of workplaces from Sept. 1 to try to stop a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The labor ministry said on Tuesday the new arrangement would apply to all shared spaces in offices and factories, but would not extend to individual offices where only one employee is present.

It also said that working from home would remain its recommended option for employees. A government official said masks at work would become mandatory from Sept. 1.

He further said there would be talks with employers and unions about borderline cases, such as when only two people are present in one large open-space and sitting well apart.

Details will also be worked out for special work environments such as frozen food warehouses, where masks are not practical as they would freeze.

Mask-wearing is also compulsory nationwide on all public transport and in most indoor public spaces such as shops and museums, as well as in crowded outdoor areas in some cities.

France imposed some of Europe’s toughest lockdown restrictions earlier this year, greatly reducing the rate of coronavirus infections. But in the past few weeks the numbers of new COVID-19 cases have climbed, and public health officials have warned that contagion could spin out of control.

The government has been under pressure from trade unions to step up protective measures in time for September, when people return to work after long summer holidays, and when children are due back at school.

“The best thing we can do to prepare for the return from vacations is to reassure employees that, together, we are taking the precautions to avoid spreading the virus,” Elisabeth Borne, the labor minister, was quoted as saying by the ministry.

It was the explosion that shook Beirut, 15 years before another one levelled entire neighbourhoods of the city. On Tuesday, an international court finally delivered something like justice for the first blast, finding a single Hezbollah member guilty of carrying out the 2005 car bombing that killed former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri and 21 others.

It was a verdict that satisfied few, while adding to the already sky-high tensions in Lebanon. The country’s deep political and economic crises were exacerbated by a massive Aug. 4 explosion in the port of Beirut, which killed 180 people and made 300,000 others homeless.

The more recent disaster is believed to have been caused by an unattended stockpile of ammonium nitrate. Many Lebanese blame Hezbollah – which is widely believed to have used the port for smuggling and storing weapons, and which wields wide influence over a government that ignored repeated warnings about the impending disaster – for both explosions.

A UN-backed tribunal on Tuesday convicted a Hezbollah member of conspiracy to kill former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri in a 2005 bombing. Three others charged as accomplices were acquitted. Reuters

The United Nations-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon ruled that one Hezbollah member, 57-year-old Salim Ayyash, who was tried in absentia, was guilty of five charges related to the assassination of Mr. Hariri. It was an act that rattled this country to its core, and helped ignite sectarian tensions across the Middle East.

But The Hague-based tribunal acquitted three other suspects, and ruled there was not enough evidence to link either the Hezbollah leadership or the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to the crime.

Mr. Hariri, who was backed by Saudi Arabia, France and the United States, was killed as he was lobbying for an end to Syria’s 29-year military presence in Lebanon. Following the assassination, hundreds of thousands of Lebanese took to the streets in protests that forced the Syrian army’s withdrawal from the country a few months later.

But Hezbollah has remained, and has tightened its grip on this deeply divided country. Hezbollah is backed by Iran, and its supporters are almost uniformly Shia Muslims; Mr. Hariri was Lebanon’s most prominent Sunni politician.

The 57-year-old Mr. Ayyash, who has yet to be sentenced, is believed to still be at large in the Hezbollah stronghold of southern Lebanon. The group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has dismissed the special tribunal as a tool of Western powers, and has said the group will ignore the verdict.

Speaking in The Hague after Tuesday’s ruling, Mr. Hariri’s son, Saad, called for Hezbollah to hand over Mr. Ayyash. “Nobody should expect any more sacrifices from us. We have sacrificed what is dearest to us. … Hezbollah is the one that should make sacrifices today,” he said. “We will not rest until punishment is served.”

There was palpable tension in Beirut, where a state of emergency has been in place since shortly after the port explosion. Soldiers drove in long convoys, circling through empty streets that would normally be clogged with traffic.

Anti-government protesters, who had planned to march Tuesday toward the official residence of President Michel Aoun, an ally of Hezbollah, called off their demonstration amid concerns that emotions were already too high in the country. “We’re trying not to be hot-headed,” said Karl Karam, a key organizer of the protests, which are affiliated with none of the sectarian political blocs.

Instead, a crowd of several hundred of Mr. Hariri’s supporters gathered at his tomb in the centre of the city to listen to the verdict as it was read out over loudspeakers that were mounted on top of a white van. The conviction of a single Hezbollah member did little to satisfy their desire for justice. “The person convicted belongs to an organization with a very strict hierarchy,” said 29-year-old May el-Masri, a member of Future Youth, a pro-Hariri movement. The conviction of one member, she said, means “Hezbollah is accused.”

The court didn’t go quite as far, saying only that “the evidence also established that Mr. Ayyash had affiliation with Hezbollah.”

In a 2,600-page verdict that took some five hours to read, the judges said they had been convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Ayyash was the owner of one of six mobile phones that were critical in ordering and co-ordinating the attack. The owners of the six mobile phones “had access to what could be described as ‘military grade explosives,’ "" and had “knowingly agreed to murder Mr. Hariri,” the court found. “They are thus co-conspirators.”

However, the tribunal ruled that the evidence against three other suspects – Assad Sabra, Hassan Habib Merhi and Hassan Oneissi – was “insufficient” to prove they were among the users of the other mobile phones.

Charges against a fifth suspect, Mustafa Badreddine, a top Hezbollah commander, were dropped after he was killed while fighting in Syria in 2016.

“We acknowledge that this verdict may not bring the closure desired by many in Lebanon. However, today’s verdict upholds the principle of accountability and serves as a small but significant step forward in the continued pursuit for democracy, justice and security in Lebanon,” Global Affairs Canada said in a statement. Ottawa contributed $8-million to the special tribunal in the 11 years since it was established, and several RCMP officers were seconded to the investigation.

Presiding Judge David Re said the tribunal – a panel of 15 Lebanese and international judges that made its base in the Netherlands for security reasons – had determined that “Syria and Hezbollah may have had motives to eliminate Mr. Hariri, and some of his political allies.” But, Judge Re added, “there is no evidence that the Hezbollah leadership had any involvement in Mr. Hariri’s murder and there is no direct evidence of Syrian involvement.”

Mohammed Obeidi, a political analyst seen as close to the Hezbollah leadership, said the tribunal was wise to focus on the guilt or innocence of the accused individuals, rather than the Hezbollah leadership. “This is very important, because that means they are not going to antagonize the political and security system in Lebanon. This is not important for Hezbollah – this is important for Lebanon.”

The verdict was a disappointment for those who believe Hezbollah is responsible not only for the killing of Mr. Hariri, but also a string of other assassinations that have targeted pro-Western political figures.

“There is a serial killer in Lebanon, made up of Hezbollah and the Syrian machine. I escaped, but many died,” Marwan Hamadeh, a former cabinet minister and political ally of Mr. Hariri’s, told The Globe and Mail before the verdict was announced. Mr. Hamadeh survived a 2004 car bombing that killed his bodyguard. Mr. Ayyash also stands accused of that attack, in a separate case before the same special tribunal.

Nayla Tueni, the chief executive officer of the an-Nahar newspaper, said Tuesday’s verdict and the form of accountability it brought were nonetheless important for Lebanon, especially in the wake of the port explosion.

“But I am worried, of course. I am worried every second in this phase about what will happen,” said Ms. Tueni, whose father Gebran was killed in another car bomb, 10 months after Mr. Hariri’s death. “We do not know what price we Lebanese will pay.”

Countries that hoard possible COVID-19 vaccines while excluding others will deepen the pandemic, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday, issuing a last-ditch call for countries to join a global vaccine pact.

The WHO has an Aug. 31 deadline for wealthier countries to join the “COVAX Global Vaccines Facility” for sharing vaccine hopefuls with developing countries. Dr. Tedros said he sent a letter to the WHO’s 194 member states, urging participation.

The global health agency also raised concerns that the pandemic’s spread was being driven now by younger people, many of whom were unaware they were infected, posing a danger to vulnerable groups.

Dr. Tedros’s push for countries to join COVAX comes as the European Union, Britain, Switzerland and the United States strike deals with companies testing prospective vaccines. Russia and China are also working on vaccines, and the WHO fears national interests could impede global efforts.

“We need to prevent vaccine nationalism,” Dr. Tedros told a virtual briefing. “Sharing finite supplies strategically and globally is actually in each country’s national interest.”

The European Commission has urged EU states to skirt the WHO-led initiative, citing worries over its cost and speed.

More than 21.9 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 772,647 have died, according to a Reuters tally.

‘NOT TWISTING ARMS’

So far, the COVAX facility has attracted interest from 92 poorer countries hoping for voluntary donations and 80 wealthier countries, a number little changed from a month ago, that would finance the scheme, the WHO said.

Still, some countries are waiting for the Aug. 31 deadline before making a commitment as the facility’s terms are still being finalized, said Bruce Aylward, who leads the WHO’s ACT Accelerator initiative to speed supplies of COVID-19 diagnostics, drugs and vaccines.

“We are not twisting arms for people to join,” Dr. Aylward said. “We’ve had more and more discussions with a broader and broader group of players … to work through what might be the barriers to collaborating – issues around price, issues around timing, issues around national expectations.”

With more than 150 vaccines in development, about two dozen in human studies and a handful in late-stage trials, the WHO said even countries signing bilateral deals boost their odds by joining COVAX.

“Which one will be the candidate that will be successful, we don’t know yet,” said Mariangela Simao, a WHO assistant director for drug and vaccine access. “By joining the facility at the same time that you do bilateral deals, you’re actually betting on a larger number of vaccine candidates.”

COVAX now covers nine vaccine candidates.

The WHO remains worried that infections among younger people are rising globally, putting at risk elderly and sick people in densely populated areas with weak health systems.

“The epidemic is changing,” WHO Western Pacific regional director Takeshi Kasai said. “People in their 20s, 30s and 40s are increasingly driving the spread.”

The World Health Organization has said it is concerned that the coronavirus spread is being driven by people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, many of whom are unaware they have been infected, posing a danger to vulnerable groups. Reuters

It was the explosion that shook Beirut, 15 years before another one levelled entire neighbourhoods of the city. On Tuesday, an international court finally delivered something like justice for the first blast, finding a single Hezbollah member guilty of carrying out the 2005 car bombing that killed former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri and 21 others.

It was a verdict that satisfied few, while adding to the already sky-high tensions in Lebanon. The country’s deep political and economic crises were exacerbated by a massive Aug. 4 explosion in the port of Beirut, which killed 180 people and made 300,000 others homeless.

The more recent disaster is believed to have been caused by an unattended stockpile of ammonium nitrate. Many Lebanese blame Hezbollah – which is widely believed to have used the port for smuggling and storing weapons, and which wields wide influence over a government that ignored repeated warnings about the impending disaster – for both explosions.

A UN-backed tribunal on Tuesday convicted a Hezbollah member of conspiracy to kill former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri in a 2005 bombing. Three others charged as accomplices were acquitted. Reuters

The United Nations-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon ruled that one Hezbollah member, 57-year-old Salim Ayyash, who was tried in absentia, was guilty of five charges related to the assassination of Mr. Hariri. It was an act that rattled this country to its core, and helped ignite sectarian tensions across the Middle East.

But The Hague-based tribunal acquitted three other suspects, and ruled there was not enough evidence to link either the Hezbollah leadership or the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to the crime.

Mr. Hariri, who was backed by Saudi Arabia, France and the United States, was killed as he was lobbying for an end to Syria’s 29-year military presence in Lebanon. Following the assassination, hundreds of thousands of Lebanese took to the streets in protests that forced the Syrian army’s withdrawal from the country a few months later.

Leaders fear crisis sparked by Beirut blast could lead to civil war

But Hezbollah has remained, and has tightened its grip on this deeply divided country. Hezbollah is backed by Iran, and its supporters are almost uniformly Shia Muslims; Mr. Hariri was Lebanon’s most prominent Sunni politician.

The 57-year-old Mr. Ayyash, who has yet to be sentenced, is believed to still be at large in the Hezbollah stronghold of southern Lebanon. The group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has dismissed the special tribunal as a tool of Western powers, and has said the group will ignore the verdict.

Speaking in The Hague after Tuesday’s ruling, Mr. Hariri’s son, Saad, called for Hezbollah to hand over Mr. Ayyash. “Nobody should expect any more sacrifices from us. We have sacrificed what is dearest to us. … Hezbollah is the one that should make sacrifices today,” he said. “We will not rest until punishment is served.”

There was palpable tension in Beirut, where a state of emergency has been in place since shortly after the port explosion. Soldiers drove in long convoys, circling through empty streets that would normally be clogged with traffic.

Anti-government protesters, who had planned to march Tuesday toward the official residence of President Michel Aoun, an ally of Hezbollah, called off their demonstration amid concerns that emotions were already too high in the country. “We’re trying not to be hot-headed,” said Karl Karam, a key organizer of the protests, which are affiliated with none of the sectarian political blocs.

Instead, a crowd of several hundred of Mr. Hariri’s supporters gathered at his tomb in the centre of the city to listen to the verdict as it was read out over loudspeakers that were mounted on top of a white van. The conviction of a single Hezbollah member did little to satisfy their desire for justice. “The person convicted belongs to an organization with a very strict hierarchy,” said 29-year-old May el-Masri, a member of Future Youth, a pro-Hariri movement. The conviction of one member, she said, means “Hezbollah is accused.”

The court didn’t go quite as far, saying only that “the evidence also established that Mr. Ayyash had affiliation with Hezbollah.”

In a 2,600-page verdict that took some five hours to read, the judges said they had been convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Ayyash was the owner of one of six mobile phones that were critical in ordering and co-ordinating the attack. The owners of the six mobile phones “had access to what could be described as ‘military grade explosives,’ "" and had “knowingly agreed to murder Mr. Hariri,” the court found. “They are thus co-conspirators.”

However, the tribunal ruled that the evidence against three other suspects – Assad Sabra, Hassan Habib Merhi and Hassan Oneissi – was “insufficient” to prove they were among the users of the other mobile phones.

Charges against a fifth suspect, Mustafa Badreddine, a top Hezbollah commander, were dropped after he was killed while fighting in Syria in 2016.

“We acknowledge that this verdict may not bring the closure desired by many in Lebanon. However, today’s verdict upholds the principle of accountability and serves as a small but significant step forward in the continued pursuit for democracy, justice and security in Lebanon,” Global Affairs Canada said in a statement. Ottawa contributed $8-million to the special tribunal in the 11 years since it was established, and several RCMP officers were seconded to the investigation.

Presiding Judge David Re said the tribunal – a panel of 15 Lebanese and international judges that made its base in the Netherlands for security reasons – had determined that “Syria and Hezbollah may have had motives to eliminate Mr. Hariri, and some of his political allies.” But, Judge Re added, “there is no evidence that the Hezbollah leadership had any involvement in Mr. Hariri’s murder and there is no direct evidence of Syrian involvement.”

Mohammed Obeidi, a political analyst seen as close to the Hezbollah leadership, said the tribunal was wise to focus on the guilt or innocence of the accused individuals, rather than the Hezbollah leadership. “This is very important, because that means they are not going to antagonize the political and security system in Lebanon. This is not important for Hezbollah – this is important for Lebanon.”

The verdict was a disappointment for those who believe Hezbollah is responsible not only for the killing of Mr. Hariri, but also a string of other assassinations that have targeted pro-Western political figures.

“There is a serial killer in Lebanon, made up of Hezbollah and the Syrian machine. I escaped, but many died,” Marwan Hamadeh, a former cabinet minister and political ally of Mr. Hariri’s, told The Globe and Mail before the verdict was announced. Mr. Hamadeh survived a 2004 car bombing that killed his bodyguard. Mr. Ayyash also stands accused of that attack, in a separate case before the same special tribunal.

Nayla Tueni, the chief executive officer of the an-Nahar newspaper, said Tuesday’s verdict and the form of accountability it brought were nonetheless important for Lebanon, especially in the wake of the port explosion.

Hours after mutinying soldiers seized Mali’s top leadership in an apparent coup, the West African nation’s president announced on state television that he would step down.

The resignation capped a day of dramatic developments and exposed the deepening instability of a country that has become one of Canada’s biggest recipients of military and development aid.

Earlier Tuesday, thousands of people cheered and celebrated in the streets of Mali’s capital, Bamako, as the rebel soldiers drove through the city in armoured vehicles. The city has been consumed by mass protests since June as a result of widespread anger over corruption, a weakening economy and worsening armed conflicts in much of the country.

President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and Prime Minister Boubou Cissé were detained by soldiers and escorted to the Kati military base, about 15 kilometres from the capital, according to photos on social media.

The same military base had been the origin of an earlier coup in 2012, which in turn had ignited years of deadly insurgency by Islamist radicals and other militia forces in northern and central regions of the country, killing thousands of people.

Since the beginning of the insurgencies, Mali has received an outpouring of aid from Western and African countries, including thousands of French troops and a United Nations peacekeeping force. Canada contributed by deploying helicopters and hundreds of peacekeeping soldiers to northern Mali from 2018 to 2019. But the massive aid has failed to quell the insurgencies or stabilize the fragile government.

Mali has received nearly $1.6-billion in development aid from Canada over the past two decades, including more than $136-million from 2017 to 2018, making it one of the world’s top recipients of Canadian aid. Over the past 18 months, Canada has also deployed units of police officers in Mali to support peace efforts and the reform of Mali’s security forces.

Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne, in a tweet on Tuesday, said Canada is “very concerned” by the Mali situation and “strongly condemns” the military mutiny against the government.

Canadian embassy staff in Mali are safe, he said. “We will continue to follow the situation closely.”

The United States, France, the United Nations, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States also condemned the military rebellion.

Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairperson of the African Union Commission, called for the “immediate release” of the President and Prime Minister from their “forced detention.” In a statement, he rejected any attempt at “unconstitutional change of government” and urged the mutineers to cease all violence.

The UN Security Council is reported to have called an emergency session for Wednesday to discuss the Mali crisis. There are about 13,000 soldiers and almost 2,000 police officers in the UN peacekeeping mission in Mali. France and West African countries also have thousands of soldiers in the country.

Bruno Charbonneau, a peacekeeping expert and associate professor at Royal Military College Saint-Jean in Quebec, said the mutiny and apparent coup on Tuesday had been unforeseen by experts but should not have shocked anyone.

“It is unsurprising given the stalemate of the last few years: A peace process that was going nowhere, the mounting violence notably in the central regions, a government that seemed unable and incapable of responding positively to the situation and a President who often seemed disconnected or reluctant to change his ways,” Mr. Charbonneau told The Globe and Mail.

A recent report by a UN panel of experts showed that Malian government officials “were working against the peace process and benefiting from it,” he said.

Moreover, there has been an “undeniable failure” of the international approach to Mali and the broader Sahel region, and a new strategy might now be adopted, Mr. Charbonneau said.

The international community has allowed the conflicting groups in Mali “to prolong and at times avoid the peace process, to make sure that it went nowhere,” he said. The peace process has been shaped by a counterterrorism agenda that created incentives for armed groups and government officials to undermine peace, he said.

Mr. Keita, President since 2013, has been the target of growing protests for months. Last month, at least 11 people were killed during clashes between protesters and security forces. Many people have been angered as Mali’s military has increasingly lost control of much of the country while the insurgencies grow.

The insurgencies that began in 2012 culminated in an Islamist offensive that drove south toward Bamako from northern Mali until it was halted by French military intervention in early 2013. But the continuing heavy presence of French troops and other forces failed to prevent the latest coup.

On Tuesday, as the mutiny began, Mr. Cissé issued a statement appealing for dialogue with the rebel soldiers. But he soon disappeared from view, until the mutineers took him and the 75-year-old President to their base.

An upstart Islamic State group affiliate claimed responsibility for a mortar attack in Kabul on Tuesday morning that wounded at least 10 civilians as Afghans marked their country’s Independence Day. The attack came amid new uncertainties over the start of talks between the Taliban and the Kabul government.

According to the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks militant groups’ online activity, said IS in a “communiqué” claimed credit for the firing of 16 mortar shells, which targeted the presidential palace, embassies and Afghan government offices.

The Interior Ministry’s spokesman, Tariq Arian, said a total of 14 mortar shells were fired from two vehicles in the northern and eastern part of the Afghan capital. Four children were among the wounded.

“Most of the mortar shells hit residential houses,” Arian said, adding that an investigation is under way.

More than a dozen rockets struck Kabul on Tuesday, wounding at least ten people, including children, prompting some foreign embassies to order a lockdown, officials and sources in the Afghan capital said. Reuters

According to eyewitnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity fearing reprisals, at least one mortar shell landed in the upscale Wazir Akbar Khan neighbourhood, where diplomats and senior government officials reside.

Also on Tuesday, Afghanistan’s intelligence agency said it killed the IS chief justice Abdullah Orakzai in a “complex and targeted operation,” without elaborating.

The statement said Orakzai had orchestrated a prison break earlier this month in eastern Nangarhar province that killed at least 39 people. Nearly 400 IS militants escaped in the first hours of the attack.

The mortar attack in Kabul came a day after the government said it would not release the last 320 Taliban prisoners it holds until the insurgents free more captured Afghan soldiers. The decision went against that of a traditional Afghan council held earlier this month – the Loya Jirga – and is likely to further delay intra-Afghan peace talks sought by the United States.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said he wasn’t aware of the mortar attack in Kabul. The Islamic State group’s affiliate, which operates in Afghanistan, has interrupted national celebrations in the past with rocket fire.

Also on Tuesday morning, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani attended an Independence Day ceremony at the Defence Ministry in Kabul, inspecting an honour guard and laying flowers on the Independence Minaret monument there.

Reuters

Michelle Obama used Donald Trump’s own words to skewer him on the first night of the Democratic National Convention, arguing the President was too incompetent to lead the United States through its mounting health, racial and economic crises.

“Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is,” the former first lady said, echoing the five-word phrase with which Mr. Trump dismissed the country’s COVID-19 death toll this month.

Ms. Obama’s speech was the capstone to a sombre evening in which Democrats laid out their case against Mr. Trump, assailing his handling of the pandemic and crackdown on demonstrations against police racism. They also painted him as a threat to democracy, accusing him of attempting to disenfranchise Americans with reforms to the U.S. Postal Service that would make mail delivery so slow that mail-in ballots won’t arrive in time for the election this fall.

The night was also the first extended look at pandemic-era election campaigning – a convention moved entirely online because COVID-19 made it unsafe to proceed with the event in person. Cutting between hundreds of people in different locations across the country, the evening was a major technical feat that hit just a few snags.

The convention continues for the next three nights, culminating in Joe Biden accepting the presidential nomination Thursday.

Strange bedfellows

The Democrats pitched the biggest possible tent, with a string of Republican former office holders speaking on the same night as the Senate’s only self-described socialist. The messages from these two sides of Mr. Biden’s putative voting coalition were often contradictory.

John Kasich, a former governor of Ohio who ran against Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016, exhorted conservative voters to back Mr. Biden with a pledge that he would steer a moderate course.

“I’m sure there are Republicans and independents who couldn’t imagine crossing over to support a Democrat. They fear Joe may turn sharp left and leave them behind. I don’t believe that,” Mr. Kasich said, standing at a literal crossroads. “He’s reasonable, faithful, respectful.”

Leftist Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, for his part, argued that Mr. Biden would enact progressive policies such as universal health care, affordable child care and stronger unions.

Both Mr. Kasich and Mr. Sanders did, however, acknowledge the ideological chasms separating the disparate factions coalescing behind the former vice-president. But they argued that the re-election of Mr. Trump was too dangerous not to put aside their differences.

“Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Trump golfs,” said Mr. Sanders, who spoke in front of a large pile of firewood that appeared to be stacked in his home office. “The future of our democracy is at stake.”

The telethon convention

Aiming to avoid a national political event resembling an awkward family Zoom call, the Democrats went for a rapid-fire mix of live speeches, pre-recorded voter testimonials, musical performances, brief panel discussions and archival footage, all anchored by actress Eva Longoria.

At times, the format resembled a frenetic cable news channel. Sometimes it was more like a telethon on community access television, with frequent technical slip-ups.

During a speech by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, for instance, his face suddenly jump-cut across the screen while a needless graphic of the Statue of Liberty briefly appeared and then vanished.

A production assistant walked in front of Alabama Senator Doug Jones.

Footage of an emotional speech by Mr. Biden on police brutality was abruptly interrupted by a smash cut to the former vice-president presiding over a group discussion.

In an attempt to recreate some of the crowd energy of a live convention, the feed sometimes cut to viewers cheering from their living rooms, who often took several seconds to realize they were on camera. The effect was like that of people caught on the Jumbotron at a baseball game.

At the evening’s high points, the display would show hundreds of people cheering at once, each reduced to a tiny box on the screen.

The sharpest line

Kristin Urquiza delivered the single-most memorable attack on Mr. Trump’s handling of the pandemic. She blamed him for the death of her father, Mark Anthony Urquiza. Mr. Urquiza had voted for Mr. Trump, she said, and prematurely broke quarantine to go to a karaoke bar because the President had downplayed the seriousness of the pandemic. After Mr. Urquiza died of COVID-19 in Arizona in June, Ms. Urquiza wrote an obituary in which she fired a broadside at the state’s Republican Governor, Doug Ducey, for swiftly lifting physical-distancing measures and triggering a surge of infections.

“My dad was a healthy 65-year-old. His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump – and for that he paid with his life,” she said.

The moment of silence

The brothers of George Floyd, whose death at the hands of Minneapolis police sparked the massive wave of protests against police brutality and racism this spring, led the convention in a moment of silence.

“People of all races, all ages, all genders, all backgrounds peacefully protesting in the name of love and unity is a fitting legacy for our brother,” Philonise Floyd said.

The mother of Eric Garner, who was choked to death by police in 2014, directly pressed Mr. Biden during a panel to use federal legislation to end police brutality.

“When my son was murdered, there was a big uprising. Then it settled down,” Gwen Carr said. “We can’t settle down.”

Mr. Biden pumped his fist in support. “I think people are ready,” he said.

The only explicit reference to Canada came from Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. Mocking Mr. Trump’s fragile ego, she busted out one of the lines she used regularly on the stump during her presidential nomination bid this year.

“He blames the Prime Minister of Canada for cutting him out of the Canadian version of Home Alone 2. Who does that?” Ms. Klobuchar said.

The President falsely suggested last year that Justin Trudeau had ordered his cameo edited out of a CBC broadcast of the Macaulay Culkin movie as part of the trade war between the two countries. In fact, CBC made the cut at least as early as 2015 as one of several edits to fit a television time slot.

Michelle Obama

Much of Ms. Obama’s speech was an impassioned plea to voters – many of them young or visible minorities – who had supported her husband in 2008 and 2012 but had since become disenchanted with politics.

“If you think things cannot possibly get worse, trust me, they can,” she said. “And they will if we don’t make a change in this election.

“If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.”

She conceded that Mr. Biden “is not perfect” but said he could seize the moment nonetheless if elected.

“I know Joe. He is a profoundly decent man, guided by faith,” she said. “He knows what it takes to rescue an economy, beat back a pandemic and lead our country.”
