That has led to some interesting discoveries.

For example, the most surprising book dropped off was a Russian chiropractic manual in Cyrillic script. It’s also the only book that hasn’t been picked up by someone — but that’s only because it didn’t get a chance. It was shredded one night, with the pieces left in Threlfall’s backyard.

“I guess somebody didn’t like the Russian chiropractic manual,” he said.

When he set up the Fernwood Re-Public Library, Threlfall said knew he wanted to compile statistics about which books came and went.

“What kind of books get placed in little free libraries? Who puts them there? From where? How often? Which authors? Questions were many; the answers lay in our library,” he wrote in an online post for the Greater Victoria Placemaking Network.

Threlfall said he assumed it was going to be mostly romance novels, thrillers and “crappy books that nobody wants to read” in the library, which operates on the principle of “leave a book, take a book.”

He was surprised by the quality, variety and the age of the books dropped off, including original publications from the 1920s and 1930s as well as reprints of classic novels, like Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations.

“I don’t think we have yet to receive a romance novel at all,” he said. “And seeing what comes through is pretty fantastic.”

For four months, Threlfall has tracked the comings and goings each morning and evening from the repurposed bedside table. He logs the title, author, genre, dates in and out, whether the public or his family places the book and whether it’s a paperback or hard cover.

Threlfall has also logged some non-book items that have shown up in the library, including a drill bit set, two loaves of bread, three VHS tapes, four squirt guns, five street maps, a pair of prescription glasses and a single Christmas ornament.

He thought the VHS tapes especially would take a while to move, but a 1980 Bruce Lee film called Fist of Fear, Touch of Death, was gone within two days.

“How many people even have a VHS player anymore?”

Some books are only in the library for a matter of minutes, taken almost as soon as he places them. His family has left 266 books and the public has left 395.

In 15 weeks, he’s found fiction outweighs nonfiction (535 to 126), paperbacks exceed hardcovers (520 to 141), and works by women trump those by men (430 to 204).

Mystery books have been most popular, followed by children’s books, literary fiction, thrillers, historical fiction and young adult novels.

A couple of authors, Camilla Lackberg and Ian Rankin, have appeared at least ten times.

A biography of hockey player and coach Pat Quinn spent the longest stint in the library, waiting 32 days to be checked out.

Threlfall, a writer and former journalist, created a diverse summer reading list for himself out of books he found in the library, which inspired him to branch out of his usual non-fiction choices.

As a self-described “word nerd” with a house full of books, Threlfall said having people deliver books to the library just outside his home is fabulous and tracking the details has been a fun social experiment.

“It’s just been a source of constant amusement and fascination,” he said.

The Greater Victoria Placemaking Network has created a map identifying the locations of the more than 300 little free libraries in Greater Victoria.

On Aug. 6, Clark M. Clark, known as the living statue Plasterman, died of a massive heart attack at home in Victoria. He was unaware he had severe coronary disease. He was 57.

Daniel Roden Clark, 22, said the essence of his father was being kind, loving and full of joy. “He was uncompromising in his optimism. Even in dark times there was always a light at the end of the tunnel in his view.”

Christopher Loran, who does radio promotions for the Q and The Zone, said just days earlier Clark had brought him a film script he wrote, an improv piece about relationships, and asked Loran if he would work on it with him.

“He was a great ambassador for Victoria,” said Loran. “No one who has walked through Inner Harbour in the last 20 years has not seen Plasterman and noticed him. He brought smiles to people’s faces and he’s going to be missed.”

Scott McLean Clark was born in Edmonton on April 7, 1963; he legally changed his name to Clark Clark, the way it was once misprinted on a playbill. “Everyone called him Clark except for me and our dad; it was just too weird,” said brother Allan Clark.

Clark grew up in Calgary. He studied theatre and education at the University of Alberta in Edmonton and worked various jobs after university.

He spent several years living in Paris and Geneva. He taught yoga, skiied in the Swiss Alps and the Canadian Rockies, and was a strong swimmer.

He married, separated in 2002, divorced in 2006, and had one son.

“As a father he was supportive and intensely proud of my every endeavor,” said Roden Clark. “My parents divorced when I was very young but he made sure that what time I had with him as a child was full of love, laughs and lessons. “

Father and son remained close into adulthood and Clark was able to pass on “the deeper and more meaningful lessons he had learned throughout his life.”

In Victoria, he worked for 15 years as a daycare educator. He was also a children’s entertainer.

In a Times Colonist profile by Jim and Nic Hume, Clark explained his work with children: “They loved stories, and I loved telling them. And I found they really loved stories when I put a bit of acting in — and I loved the telling and the acting.”

Chivonne Graff met Clark in a workshop on “circle time” for early educators. Clark came with a suitcase filled with props.

“I was inspired to put aside my self-consciousness and tap into my playful, child-like side when engaging with children in groups at circle time,” said Graff. “He was one of two outstanding male educators that I have known in 25 years in the field. He had a special presence in this community.”

Throughout the years, Clark acted in local stage and film productions and was an improv coach. He was infected with the acting bug in Grade 6, after playing the lead in a school play.

At age 36, the fan of Charlie Chaplin embarked on becoming an independent entertainer by creating his first living statues with his best-known act evolving into Plasterman.

Clark started out as “that statue guy” wearing white clothes from Value Village, make-up, a white sheet covering a milkcrate to stand on, and a sign reading “Totally Plastered in Victoria.”

That evolved into a character bathed head to toe in thick white fabric paint, resembling plaster, standing motionless on a wooden block. His bald head and shaved eyebrows (which he did for the busking season) added to his stark image.

Standing out in the summer sun all day seemed an odd choice for a man allergic to the sun.

Nevertheless, since 2000, each May to mid-October, he practised his art.

“He loved his work as a human statue,” said Roden Clark. “The happiness and entertainment it brought people meant the world to him.”

Musician Dave Harris, who has busked on the streets of Victoria for 44 years and now plays on Government Street, met Clark about 20 years ago and described him as “very easy to deal with, friendly, warm and kind.”

“He became one of the most loved and busiest buskers; he worked very hard, often six to eight hours a day in the hot sun,” said Harris.

Some would nearly pass Plasterman only to get a scare upon realizing he was human. He might make a sudden move to silence the cheeky youth, maybe a wink or a grin to the curious.

If tourists wanted a photo he would come to life, for a moment, with a smile or a handshake or a hug for a child. He posed with hundreds of people each day. He graciously acknowledged tips. He said in an interview he made enough money to meet his needs.

“Fun story about Plasterman,” said Harris. “I’m playing in one spot, he’s down the way. A woman with her young son come by. She says, ‘Put the coin in the case. He says, ‘I want to give it to Plasterman.’ I laughed so hard.”

Olympic marathoner and coach Bruce Deacon first met Clark in the non-denominational New Life Community Fellowship church with his then young family. Over the years the two kept in touch.

Plasterman was a constant figure in Victoria and that’s why it’s so hard to imagine him gone, said Deacon.

When the City of Victoria began having buskers audition for a prime rotation of spots, Clark and other veterans were grandfathered in.

“He had a way of touching people’s hearts,” said Deacon, noting his comedic timing and his ability to read people were key. “He knew when he should break from his Plasterman pose to give someone a hug or when to show compassion or when to do something funny or silly with someone,” said Deacon. “He was just brilliant that way.”

Clark said he easily adapted to the stillness — he once timed himself at 45 minutes without moving with the exception of a blink — but it took him years to master how to read and respond, or not, to the audience.

Clark, born to Velma (nee Young) and William Clark, leaves behind his son Daniel, mother Velma, sister Brenda, and brothers Allan and Roger. His father died in 2016 at age 92, in Victoria.

The mother of a Sooke teenager was first angry, then scared, when her 15-year-old son called to say he was on the way to the Royal Jubilee Hospital after being poked by a needle in Rutledge Park.

“I was like ‘What’s happening?’ There are so many people getting hurt by these needles,” said Jayna Forgie, who wrote about what happened in posting to Facebook.

“It’s just scary. My concern is that he would contract something that could be serious. My other concern is that other people are in the park, too. I thought people should be aware. Our kids grew up in that area and played there all the time. I want people to know, if you go out, this happens.”

Her son had been sitting on the grass with a friend, she said. When he went to lie down, the needle poked him in the back.

The needle wasn’t placed to intentionally hurt anyone, it was just discarded, said Forgie.

“It’s a pretty decent neighbourhood so I was pretty surprised. The needle was probably missed in their cleaning routine.”

Her son was examined at the hospital and had a baseline blood test. He will have to have another blood test in three weeks to see if there are any changes.

‘Thank God, it wasn’t a deep puncture,” she said.

Saanich police Const. Markus Anastasiades said police were not notified of the call at the time.

""We are very concerned to hear that this happened and hope that the young man is not facing any serious injuries or health concerns as a result,"" he said.

""Our officers do conduct Park Patrols on a daily basis to ensure compliance with overnight campers. Until this incident, we have not had any recent files involving needles found in parks.""

On Tuesday, Victoria police warned people about an uncapped needle which had been taped to a bench in Centennial Square in a way that would have harmed anyone who sat down.

The uncapped needed was found by a City of Victoria staff member around 10:50 a.m.

On Saturday night, Victoria police issued a warning after a man was pricked by an uncapped needle in Beacon Hill Park. The man told police he was walking on the chip trail in Beacon Hill Park, near Douglas Street and Avalon Road, when he stepped off the path and felt a pain in his foot.

Police don’t know if anyone was injured by the uncapped needle taped to the bench in Centennial Square. They are continuing to investigate. Anyone with information is asked to call the non-emergency line at 250 995-7654 and press 1 for the report desk. To report what you know anonymously, call Greater Victoria Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.

City staff try to safely collect needles on city property and routinely empty drop boxes for sharps when they collect garbage, said spokesman Bill Eisenhauer. A number of groups, including the Downtown Victoria Business Association Clean Team, Aids Vancouver Island Mobile Harm Reduction Unit, SOLID and others pick up used sharps and have programs to educate and encourage the safe disposal of needles. The city also works with Island Health, AVI and other community organizations on harm reduction initiatives and encourages the safe disposal of used syringes, said Eisenhauer.

City staff, who are trained to sweep for hazards in their work areas, are provided with personal protective equipment to safely dispose of any discarded needles they may come across.There are 29 safe disposal boxes in Victoria which are checked multiple times a week and emptied as needed. Boxes in high-use areas are emptied more frequently.

“The boxes are strategically located in various places across the city to support the safe disposal of sharps by the public. We have recently added additional boxes in Centennial Square, Central Park and Beacon Hill Park,” said Eisenhauer.

The DVBA clean team looks after private property in the downtown business area.

“As the opioid crisis continues, I understand data from multiple agencies indicates that there has been an increase in the number of unsafely discarded needles over the last few years,” he said.

Learning groups at the secondary level can be up to 120 people.
The district will be prepared to accommodate students and staff wanting in-class learning.
Cendra Beaton, president of the Sooke Parents’ Education Advisory Council, said parents are asking for more flexibility in the return to school.","The back-to-school plan in the Sooke district will feature a “1/8th model” for secondary students that sees them in school every day for one course.

The 1/8th label refers to the fact that students tend to take eight courses throughout the school year..

“Not only does the 1/8th model drastically reduce the number of people in a cohort, it also reduces the number of people in school at any given time, thereby limiting the number of people on common spaces,” district superintendent Scott Stinson said in a statement.

Outside of that one class in the morning or afternoon “students will have the remainder of the day for self-directed learning, either at home or on-site where they can receive additional support or access resources,” he said.

Face coverings will be required in high-traffic areas such as hallways and buses.

Schedules will be in place for five weeks at a time.

B.C. school districts are required to give details on their back-to-school plans to the Education Ministry by today.

At the elementary and middle school level, students will return to full-time classes in their own classroom groupings, although two classes can join together to create “learning groups” of up to 60 people. Learning groups will have recess and lunch together, and possibly physical education.

Learning groups at the secondary level can be up to 120 people.

For elementary school, there will be regular school hours and 100 per cent in-class instruction, with staggered start and dismissal times. Face coverings will be optional.

Middle school will also have regular school hours and 100 per cent in-class instruction, with face coverings required in the same way as secondary schools.

The district will be prepared to accommodate students and staff wanting in-class learning.

Cendra Beaton, president of the Sooke Parents’ Education Advisory Council, said parents are asking for more flexibility in the return to school.

“There are absolutely parents that feel it’s a must to send their kids back, there’s parents that are on the fence and there’s parents that don’t feel that it’s safe, given their family circumstances, to send their children back.”

Some parents would like to some sort “hybrid” system, like an “online hub” where teachers are in place to work with students online, Beaton said. She said the month-long return to classes in June featured a hybrid system that worked well.

Sooke School Board chairman Ravi Parmar said that health, safety and student choice are at the foundation of the district’s approach.

“We knew staff and families had questions, so we wanted to implement measures that would build confidence and meet the strong guidelines set by Dr. [Bonnie] Henry and the provincial health office.”

Other steps being taken include:Increased cleaning and disinfectingDesignated entrances and floor markings/signage to control traffic flow.Isolated rooms in case someone falls ill at school.

There are two outbreaks of COVID-19 at health-care facilities in the Fraser Health region, one at Bear Creek Villa and the other at Langley Memorial Hospital.

Health officials declared an outbreak at the hospital in Langley when a patient tested positive after being discharged Monday and noticed symptoms on returning home.

Dr. Elizabeth Brodkin, Fraser Health’s interim chief medical health officer, says they are working to identify how many people may have been exposed.

She says the hospital has put in place infection prevention and control measures including cleaning and strict personal protective equipment requirements.

On its website, Fraser Health says someone at Bear Creek Villa was diagnosed with COVID-19. It says residents and staff are being screened twice-daily for any signs of the illness.

Vancouver Coastal Health, meanwhile, is asking people who were at the Prive Kitchen and Bar to monitor themselves for potential symptoms of COVID-19. It says people could have been exposed to a possible infection during operating hours on Aug. 3, 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, and 17."

Alerts about several other potential exposures have been posted recently.

On Tuesday, B.C. Ferries said one of their employee tested positive for COVID-19. Public health officials completed contract tracing with anyone who possibly came in contact with the employee and determined that there were no re-transmissions to other employees or members of the public, said B.C. Ferries spokeswoman Deborah Marshall. Marshall did not disclose where the employee worked or on which route.

Graeme Johnston, president of the B.C. Ferry and Marine Workers’ Union, said in a statement that the union is aware of the potential COVID-19 exposure aboard B.C. Ferries.

“B.C. Ferries and the health authority are working to ensure any possible exposure is traced and isolated,” he said. “We will be keeping close watch on this matter, and wish any involved swift and complete recovery.”

In March, at least one B.C. Ferries employee tested positive for the virus.

As of Monday, masks were required for passengers and staff at all B.C. Ferries terminals and aboard all vessels. Passengers don’t have to wear masks if they are in a vehicle or when they are consuming food or drinks, as long as they are two metres away from others. The rule does not apply to children younger than two, people with underlying medical conditions or a disability that prohibits mask wearing, and people unable to remove their mask without assistance.

B.C. Ferries has also implemented additional cleaning between sailings, screens passengers at ticket booths and requires physical distancing in terminals and on board vessels.

Several Greater Victoria businesses have closed temporarily in the past two weeks after employees tested positive for COVID-19. Between Friday and Saturday, B.C. recorded its highest number of one-day COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic, with 109 people testing positive.

On Tuesday, Island Health issued alerts about two businesses in Sidney after staff members tested positive for COVID-19: Mary’s Bleue Moon Cafe, and 10 Acres Cafe & Market.

On its Facebook page, Mary’s Bleue Moon Cafe, located at 9535 Canora Rd., said it was closed Tuesday and had scheduled “deep cleaning and disinfecting.” Anyone who was at the restaurant on Aug. 21 between 4 and 9:15 p.m. or on Aug. 22 between 9:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. or 5 and 10 p.m. is asked to monitor themselves for symptoms.

The infected 10 Acres staff member worked Aug. 20 and 21 from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Management said on the restaurant’s Facebook page that there is no crossover between the Sidney location, which is at 9805 Seaport Pl., and the restaurant’s downtown locations, The Commons & 10 Acres Bistro. The cafe and 10 Acres at The Pier restaurant will be closed until at least Wednesday for sanitization.

The risk of exposure is low but anyone at these locations at the specified times is asked to monitor for symptoms. Symptoms may include: fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, runny nose, loss of taste or smell, headache, fatigue, diarrhea, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, and muscle aches. There is no need to self-isolate unless you develop symptoms.

There is no known risk to anyone who visited the cafes outside the specified dates and times.

Twist Salon, located at the Bear Mountain Resort in Langford, also shut its doors after one of its stylists tested positive for COVID-19, after being in close contact with another person with the virus. According to a social media post, the salon will be closed until the second week of September as a precautionary measure.

On Friday, Chatters Salon Victoria Westshore announced it would be closing over the weekend after a stylist tested positive for COVID-19. The salon said the stylist hadn’t worked since Aug. 17 and that anyone potentially exposed would be contacted by the health authority.

Milestones Grill and Bar in the Inner Harbour has closed for a deep clean after an employee tested positive on Aug. 20. The restaurant plans to reopen on Aug. 30.

On Aug. 14, 7-Eleven on Douglas Street closed its doors after an employee tested positive for the virus. The company asked anyone who visited the store between Aug. 10 and Aug. 14 to call the provincial COVID-19 health line at 811. The store reopened on Aug. 17.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said public health teams are tracing and identifying close contacts of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and providing clear direction on what to do. Advisories are posted by health authorities only when contact tracers can’t find everyone possible exposed to a person with COVID-19.

The province had its highest-ever overdose fatalities in June, with 177 deaths due to extreme concentrations of illicit fentanyl in street drugs after border closures stopped the flow of substances typically trafficked in the province.

The coroners service said Tuesday the death toll in July represents a 136 per cent increase over the 74 deaths during the same month last year.

Provincewide, there were 909 drug deaths in the first seven months of the year. That included 84 in Victoria, compared with 61 in all of last year. Victoria saw 17 deaths in July, up from 16 in June but down from 22 in May. Nanaimo has recorded 24 deaths this year, compared with a total of 27 in 2019.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry joined chief coroner Lisa Lapointe in calling for a robust response to the overdose crisis, saying it’s discouraging that pandemic-related measures such as physical distancing have contributed to overdose fatalities as people use drugs alone.

“I implore anybody who’s using drugs right now, do not do it alone. You need to have your lifeguard there,” Henry said, referring to the presence of someone with the overdose-reversing medication naloxone.

Henry said street drugs are increasingly being cut with substances such as benzodiazepines, non-opioids often prescribed for anxiety, which makes reversal of an overdose with naloxone more difficult.

The onus is on both the provincial and federal governments to act swiftly in addressing the overdose crisis, Henry said.

“It’s not been recognized as the public health emergency that it is across the country,” she said, adding there’s a misconception that prescription opioids are causing overdoses.

Henry has called for the decriminalization of small amounts of drugs for personal use. Last week, Canada’s chief medical health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, made the same suggestion, saying it’s one step that could be taken to help address a recent spike in fatal overdoses in B.C., Alberta and Ontario.

A temporary federal exemption of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act in response to the pandemic led to new provincial guidelines allowing doctors to prescribe substitute medications, including hydromorphone, for users of opioids.

However, the exemptions will expire at the end of September.

Leslie McBain, spokeswoman for Moms Stop the Harm, said that group, along with others including the BC/Yukon Association of Drug War Survivors and the B.C. Association of People on Opioid Maintenance, have stopped attending government-convened committees after several years of participation due to an inadequate response from the province.

McBain, whose 25-year-old son, Jordan Miller, died of an overdose in February 2014, said the groups wrote to Premier John Horgan on Aug. 14 but have not received a response.

Horgan was not immediately available for comment, but Mental Health Minister Judy Darcy said in a statement that the impacts of the toxic drug supply are being felt across Canada.

Toronto recorded 27 overdose deaths in July, a record for that city; 41 people died in Vancouver that month, followed by 53 in June as British Columbia is disproportionately affected by the crisis.

McBain said the advocacy groups were brought together by B.C.’s Overdose Emergency Response Centre many times.

“What we have found over this time is that the advice or the wisdom that we have as people with lived and living experience was never included in the policies, so we felt really tokenized,” she said.

“So we decided to step away until we get meetings with the higher-level ministers and the premier so we can really see where we’re at with our advocacy. We feel like we’re spinning our wheels right now.”

Henry said peer support workers and advocacy groups have pushed the province to take initiatives in addressing its high number of overdoses.

“They are critical, their voice is critical at our table. I will continue to reach out and I know the value of people with lived experience and families that are dealing with these issues,” she said.

Guy Felicella, peer clinical adviser with the Overdose Emergency Response Centre and the B.C. Centre on Substance Use, said the voices of people with personal experiences are vital because they understand issues such as discrimination and stigma against drug users battling a chronic relapsing condition of addiction.

“It breaks my heart that people who use drugs are a symbol of tokenism at the table when they should be the main ingredient, and until that changes, unfortunately, people are walking away,” said Felicella, who overdosed six times before seeking treatment.

“It’s extremely challenging for me to watch the lack of action that’s implied in this crisis when I see the response on the COVID side of things.”

Almost 6,000 people have fatally overdosed in B.C. since 2015; a health emergency that is still in effect was declared by the province in 2016.

Pottie has a second dinosaur — a duckbill parasaurophus — that he hopes to collect from Langley this week.

“He breathes. His head goes up and down. It looks like he’s going to bite you,” Pottie said Monday, adding that Lance also growls and snorts but doesn’t walk.

Once Lance was installed on Pottie’s Lantzville property at 7890 Clark Dr. West, “we stayed up there half the night sitting there with him.”

Pottie said he spent more than $40,000 to buy the two beasts at Able Auctions’ online auction this month. The dinosaurs used to be part of a travelling exhibition.

Asked if there’s been any buyer’s remorse, he replied: “Oh, no way!”

“From the time we got him home here and started putting him together, you can’t even measure the amount of fun and excitement we’ve had with the dinosaur so far,” he said.

Friends sent Pottie information on the upcoming online auction, suggesting he was “the kind of guy who would get involved in this.”

After all, he already had an old fire truck, an imitation fort (with a out-of-commission U.S. civil war cannon on its way) and more displays on the property where his companies DJ Excavating and Country Buds Dispensary are located.“I’m like a kid at heart.”

On auction day, he was prepared. “You had to bid really fast and the prices were going through the roof on these things.”

Bids were starting at $10,000 for some items.

“We had a lot of fun,” he said.

His secretary was on the computer doing the bidding. “She was just spending my money like crazy,” Pottie said with a laugh.

Pottie and two of his workers took a truck and trailer to the mainland, where the auction site was ready with a forklift to transfer the 2,800-pound dinosaur in a special travelling rack. The dinosaurs were designed to come apart.

“When I pulled into the ferry terminal in Tsawwassen, it went crazy. Everybody emptied out of their vehicles and had to come over and see the dinosaur.”

When he got home, Pottie posted a notice online that whoever came up with a name would receive $50 and another $50 would be donated to the food bank. He plans to do the same thing for dino No. 2.

Pottie, a former candidate for mayor, chose the name Lance “because he lives in Lantzville.”

Locals are pouring into Pottie’s yard to view the dinosaur. “It’s going nuts here.”

Lance runs on a timer, operating for four minutes and then pausing. Pottie gets a kick out of startling visitors.

“I have a remote control in my desk in my office. And when I see people standing around and getting their picture taken, I’ll turn it on and it’ll start making noise.”

When children get up close to Lance, “their eyes just light up,” he said. “It’s priceless.”

Corey Yantha, president of Dispension Industries Inc., said his company’s machines will be leased to pharmacies and safe injection sites in Dartmouth, N.S., London, Ont., and Vancouver and Victoria. Dispension will provide all of the data-management services.

“A person can access the machine by simply scanning their palm and the machine will know that this person gets this dose [amount] and it will dispense their medication within 15 seconds,” Yantha said in a recent interview.

The machines look like ATMs, weigh about 360 kilograms and are called MySafe Verified Identity Dispenser. They are tamper-proof and provide a safe way for addicts to get clean opioids such as hydromorphone instead of off the street.

The initiative is an extension of a pilot project using the machines that began late last year in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside — an area that has been at the centre of the opioid crisis.

It’s estimated more than 15,000 Canadians have died of an opioid-related overdose since January 2016. More than 5,000 of those deaths have occurred in British Columbia alone.

“We’ve had a pilot going in Vancouver since December,” Yantha said. “We dispensed nearly 4,000 packets of opioids to people who were at risk.”

The MySafe pilot project is the brainchild of Dr. Mark Tyndall, who has spent 20 years working in harm reduction and is a professor of medicine at the University of British Columbia’s school of population and public health.

He said the initial pilot enrolled 20 people, with 10 to 12 participants who remain active for follow-up surveys. Tyndall said there were no overdoses involving people who used the machines and about a third of participants have claimed to have stopped their street drug use.

“The sample size is really small obviously, but it’s had a huge impact to the people’s lives that are currently using it,” he said in a recent interview. “We need more numbers to really show that’s happening and the deployment of five more machines will give us some more evaluative power to do that.”

A study published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal called on Canada to seek a new approach in battling the overdose crisis.

The study’s lead author, Dr. Alexis Crabtree of the University of British Columbia, said an often-overlooked approach is the use of opioids such as methadone and buprenorphine to treat opioid addiction. Researchers showed that few people with those kinds of opioids in their system overdose.

Tyndall said there is street-level support for safe, drug-supply efforts such as the MySafe program.

“The problem right now is getting the system engaged,” he said. “Providing an actual safe supply still has a lot of barriers because, in fact, we are asking physicians to prescribe drugs where they have been told not to prescribe because they are dangerous. So getting over that hurdle is ongoing.”

Tyndall said the machines are programmed to an individual drug user’s needs, while giving them a certain amount of autonomy and also freeing them from stigma.

“If they know that they have a secure supply of these drugs their life changes automatically,” he said. “They don’t have to get up in the morning and go and steal something or find money in the informal economy.”

People registered for the program have to have a history of overdose and also must have tested positive for fentanyl in their urine. An encrypted profile is created for them using data from urine samples and from a biometric scan of the vein patterns in their palms.

Incorporated since 2017, Dispension had been focused on securing distribution of regulated products such as medical and recreational cannabis.

“In 2018 we shifted gears,” Yantha said, “to using this technology for harm reduction. We think this (MySafe) is an innovative, cost-effective approach in dealing with an overdose crisis that has dragged on far too long.”

Earlier this month, Dispension received a $500,000 loan from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency to help build dispensing machines for the program."

If you love the outdoors, you may have already paid a visit to the Kootenays or Valemount for the abundance of activities. But, once is never enough. From hiking to biking, paddling to golfing, there’s plenty to keep you entertained.

With four lift-accessed bike parks (including Golden’s Kicking Horse Mountain Resort) and 600-plus trails, the Kootenays are a mountain biker’s paradise. Whether your ascent is lift- or leg-powered, you can conquer some of BC’s best-known bike trails, maneuvering through tight singletrack and wheeling through alpine wildflowers.

Paddle the calm waterways or navigate raging rapids. Kootenay Lake, home to the world’s largest trout species, is prime for fishing. Tip: hire a guide for insider knowledge. Meanwhile, tee time is served with spectacular mountain views when you golf at one of the 25 championship courses in the Kootenays.

Experience Authentic Mountain Culture

A trip to BC’s mountain towns, as wild and vibrant as the nature surrounding them, is a rite of passage for every British Columbian. Tucked into valleys, on shores of rivers, and along old railway routes, communities like Fernie and Cranbrook are pulsing with energy and entrepreneurial spirit. Spoiler alert: the vibe is infectious, if you haven’t already been.

As you may have observed, a feverish pursuit of outdoor activities and great coffee are common traits, but each town has its own personality and charm. Swing by a java joint, like Nelson’s Oso Negro, to find friendly faces and a laid-back vibe. Absorb the ethos of each place by visiting Indigenous-owned businesses, exploring historic attractions, popping into boutiques, and meeting interesting characters.

In the mountains, a day of adventure almost always ends with an après. Sip craft beer on a sun-drenched patio, and live like the locals do—if only for a short while."

Explore the Fraser Valley

In British Columbia, we’re blessed with natural settings that are as fruitful as they are beautiful. Rolling fields, vineyards, and wide-open spaces are all ready for exploration—and adventure.

A trip just east of the city to the Fraser Valley is the quickest way to immerse in farm life. Beginning in Langley, you can nibble your way from farm to farm to Abbotsford and beyond—all family-run operations that boast everything from fresh-from-the-garden fruits and vegetables to homemade waffles, ice creams, and ciders. Among the pretty landscapes and grazing cattle, you can ride the rapids during a river-rafting excursion or try your hand at catch-and-release sturgeon fishing near Chilliwack. To understand more about local Indigenous culture, opt for a guided tour of the area’s significant sites.

Road Trip to the Okanagan

There are many ways to journey to the Okanagan, and we know them all: the oft-travelled Highway 1; scenic Highway 7; Highway 5/Highway 97, a.k.a. “the fast route”; and Highway 3/Highway 97. But don’t rush along these corridors.

Fuel up at coffee shops and dig into some of the best home cooking anywhere at famed roadside diners in Hope. With bellies full, test your mettle on winding trails or seek out quiet spots at local green spaces. Pedal fast and furious at bike parks or visit historic ranches and outdoorsy resorts, and consider staying awhile.

That demand for pizza delivery has jumped is not in dispute.
Pizza Hut’s parent company, Yum Brands, reported this year that pizza take-out sales reached an eight-year high and revenue from take-out and delivery increased by double digits in the second quarter.
Pizza Hut, however, has announced it will close 300 restaurants — most of them dine-in locations — that are not designed for take-out and delivery.

That dance of hot pizza delivered to doorsteps around the world has played out in massive numbers since the World Health Organization declared the pandemic in mid-March and people started staying in and sheltering at home.

Victoria’s own masters of the pizza have seen more than their share of no-contact take-out and delivery orders across the threshold during the pandemic, but despite strong sales they have not been immune to the pressure and downside of trying to operate when the world is running at half pace.

Dimitri Mavrikos, whose family founded the Island’s five Romeo’s restaurants, said they have a delicate balancing act to manage in keeping the restaurants open and churning out pizza like they have since 1974.

Mavrikos noted their locations all have large dining rooms that have been struggling like all restaurants, while their take-out and delivery business has been strong and able to pay the bills.

“It helps, I think, when you have a good product and you’ve been a big part of the community for so many years,” he said, noting customer loyalty has been especially important over the last few months. “Even though it’s not a good time for anybody right now, when it comes time to pick up and deliver pizza we are still in business.”

At a time when dine-in revenue is down because of capacity restrictions, Romeo’s has had to deal with the added costs of safety equipment and supply-chain disruptions. Scarcity of items meant some costs have jumped by as much as 15 per cent.

Mavrikos said in order to deliver a quality product you need to pay for good ingredients.

“But what are you going to do right now, raise prices? Everyone is hurting, and if we raise prices it is going to feel like we are gouging people,” he said. “It’s hard to run the day-to-day business and make it successful without hurting yourself and hurting your customers as well.”

He said they decided to hold steady on pricing and be thankful for their strong foundation in the community; demand for takeout and delivery pizza and pasta will see them through this period.

That demand for pizza delivery has jumped is not in dispute.

Local players all say their takeout and delivery sales have been strong enough to keep the doors open, and the international food corporations that have to report financial results publicly paint a picture of a world that is fueled by mozzarella and pepperoni.

Domino’s recently reported a 30 per cent spike in profits and has massive plans to hire people around North America. Pizza Hut’s parent company, Yum Brands, reported this year that pizza take-out sales reached an eight-year high and revenue from take-out and delivery increased by double digits in the second quarter.

Papa John’s reported sales in North America increased by 28 per cent in the second quarter of this year around North America compared to the same time last year. It also has plans to hire thousands of people.

Pizza Hut, however, has announced it will close 300 restaurants — most of them dine-in locations — that are not designed for take-out and delivery.

Mark Murr, owner of Ali Baba Pizza, said the big guys like Domino’s do big business in Victoria, but they generally cater to a different market than local places like Ali Baba, Romeo’s, Hot House or Pizza Prima Strada.

“Sometimes you want a high-end pizza, and sometimes you want something cheap and quick,” he said, noting everyone wants McDonald’s sometimes.

Murr said the size of the big players and their massive advertising budgets actually helps the local pizza guys.

“They have created an avenue for us,” he said, noting when a Domino’s or Pizza Hut ad comes on TV it may get a regular Ali Baba customer thinking about pizza and picking up the phone. “I always look at it as a positive.”

Murr said their business is steady, if not strong right now.

“We are shifting how we do business. We are not as profitable as we were but are operating to keep our family working and our staff working with us,” he said. “We want to make sure everyone is safe and survives through this and their families are all going to be okay.”

Murr said they have beefed up their online presence and enabled online ordering from their six Island locations.

“It’s all had its ups and downs. Many of our stores are doing well, but not as well as they were,” he said. They have lost their wholesale business, which included the university, arena and school programs, and daytime sales downtown have dropped because people are working from home.

But they have seen some strong sales since re-opening their Swartz Bay location at the ferry terminal and good return on their online investment.

“We are adapting and doing our best,” he said. “That’s something entrepreneurs do best, we adapt and pivot quickly where larger agencies can’t really do that.”

George Papaloukas, owner of Hot House Pizza, agrees, noting his company’s four locations have had to recover quickly after losing its UVic business – it had three small outlets on campus.

“But the regular business has been good, though the last two weeks of March were challenging,” he said. “It helped that [early in the pandemic] a lot of restaurants had closed down.”

Hot House also improved its online order service and paid its staff bonuses in the early stages of the pandemic, in appreciation for staying and working.

Papaloukas said his stores have continued to see steady business, plenty of pizza-by-the-slice sales and very little cash.

“Nothing really changed for us other than limiting the number of customers in the store and less cash,” he said.

One other factor that could play into the hands of the local pizza players is that the NHL and NBA are back on TV and the Vancouver Canucks have advanced to the next round of the playoffs.

“Hockey nights are very strong and always help,” said Mavrikos, though the slightly pessimistic fan couldn’t help but point out “it could all be over soon.”

Landowner Wesbild Holdings Ltd. hopes to redevelop the southern 2.6 hectares of the site at McKenzie Avenue, Shelbourne Street and Cedar Hill Road for a mixed of commercial and residential uses.

A total of four, six-storey buildings would go up. Plans call for 598 rental units and 19,096 square metres of new commercial space. A six-metre-wide pedestrian and cycling connector is proposed to link Arrow Road through to Shelbourne Street.

There are some sticking points, though. The municipality is keen to see underground utility lines installed along the Cedar Hill Road side of the project but the developer has indicated an unwillingness to do so because the cost could reach $1 million, council heard. Council would like to see “significant trees” in this project and if above-ground wiring is used then those trees could be pruned by B.C. Hydro, Coun. Judy Brownoff said.

Another issue is Wesbild’s proposal to put in 20 electrical vehicle charging stations. Some council members said they want that number increased. Saanich earlier voted to require every new residential unit to have a line which could be used for an EV charger, Coun. Colin Plant said.

The third issue concerns a planned day-care on the second floor in one of the buildings. The applicant is concerned about the implications for that level if a day care operator can not be found, Plant said.

The aim is to iron out these issues prior to a public hearing. No date has been set.

The plan includes $500,000 from Wesbild to Saanich’s affordable housing fund. Contributions anticipated from the development would total $1.56 million, municipal staff said in a report.

The residential component of the project would include micro units, studios, one bedroom, one bedroom and den, two bedroom and three bedroom units. All would be designated as rental in perpetuity. Ten per cent would be offered at 10 per cent below market value.

Home Depot would remain in place. The project does not include the service station at Shelbourne Street and McKenzie Avenue.

The Gordon Head Residents’ Association supported the additional below-grade parking but expressed concerns about the loss of commercial floor space and parking, the staff report said.

Although the Mount Tolmie Community Association said it had no objections, it recommended a hotel be considered on the property. It also expressed a desire for more three-bedroom units and is concerned about pedestrian safety.

The Quadra Cedar Hill Community Association had traffic concerns, saying parking and congestion may overflow into nearby residential streets and that traffic may back up along Cedar Hill Road. Members also said 20 EV charging stations for 399 residential parking spaces is inadequate.

Plans would see 150 trees removed from the site, many of which are small, the staff report said. They would be replaced by 262 new trees and $5,000 would go to the Saanich tree replacement fund.

Dr. Bonnie Henry has been urging us to go outside.

Over the past years, research has demonstrated the value of simply being outside. Our physical and mental well-being are supported by fresh air, trees and all the life found outside. As COVID-19 is difficult to catch when you’re outdoors, being outside is the best place to exercise as well as to enjoy our communities and cope with our anxieties and uncertainties.

article continues below

At the start of the pandemic, I went walking to Beacon Hill Park each day to watch the herons building their nests. Both my walking and my observation of the yearly ritual of nest building was calming and centering.

Believing in the restorative power of being in the green and breathing world, nine years ago I helped start B.C.’s first Nature Kindergarten in the Sooke School District.

Once, while walking with some children in the forest surrounding Royal Roads University, I saw how two children, struggling with their own issues, found solace in finding slugs. Having a slug to accompany them on the walk in the forest seemed calming and grounding for them.

There is a growing group of educators who feel that young children benefit from ample time spent in the living, breathing world. Forest Schools and Nature Kindergartens have been a familiar aspect of early childhood education in Northern Europe for more than 40 years. In B.C., Nature Kindergartens have spread beyond Sooke and can now be found in Williams Lake, Salmon Arm and Abbotsford. These programs usually spend all morning outside.

By all accounts, these have been a success, and more are popping up all the time.

Spending time outdoors for learning is catching on, but licensed, full-day outdoor childcare is not legal in B.C. A year ago, a pilot project creating licensed outdoor early childhood programs began in Washington State…. So, why not B.C.?

Early childhood educators in the Victoria area have created outdoor programs for young children, but have run into licensing restrictions. These programs are licensed by the province as an assurance that they meet minimal criteria (staffing, space etc.) for their type of program, whether preschool, child care, or family child care. At the moment, programs are licensed only if they have a physical space which meets provincial requirements. But how can you license the forest, a park, or a beach?

Inspectors say outdoor ECE programs are not possible due to current legislation. Some local programs carry on without a license because the demand is there from families, but unlicensed programs cannot access subsidies for parents who need help with the fees, and they cannot provide assurance that they have met a minimal set of criteria.

The only outdoor ECE programs that can be licensed are those that have a structure, because ultimately it is the building which is licensed. Yet a quality program is not about a structure; people are the key to a good program.

There are various initiatives working to find a way to license outdoor early learning programs. But the issue is broader than simply licensing ECE outdoor programs.

Listening to the advice of health officials, early childhood educators working in currently licensed facilities are looking at ways to move programs outside.

While not all programs want to be outdoors, many educators realize more time outdoors is beneficial to both staff and children; and parents are also looking to outdoor programs as part of the solution to keep their children safe. Parents, government and educators need to have conversations about how to safely license and monitor ECE programs that are outdoors as well as to share information about good outdoor practice.

The benefits of bringing children outdoors are too strong to ignore, and families want outdoor learning options for their young children.

By having this conversation, I believe that the provincial government of B.C. could begin to license child-care programs that operate in a safe and thoughtful manner outdoors, as well as opening opportunities for broader conversations with all early childhood programs on how to be outside with young children.

Not only being able to increase child care spaces, but providing information to programs who want to heed the call to go outside. Programs in Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom have shown themselves to be safe and to benefit children’s well-being and learning. Programs are being created in New Zealand, Australia, China, Japan and most recently Washington State.

British Columbia could help lead the way for Canada in a time that needs these programs for children and for families."

The kind of meal nice to enjoy on a patio while sipping a cocktail, perhaps a margarita, mojito or rum punch.

The main dish is mojo prawns. “Mojo” is a reference to the Cuban/Caribbean-style citrusy mixture you marinate, cook and sauce the prawns with. Also flavouring the prawns are garlic, a touch of butter, which adds richness to the dish, honey, which balances the tanginess of the citrus, and aromatic spices, namely cumin and chipotle chili powder.

article continues below

Chipotle chili powder is made from ground, dried smoked jalapeño peppers. It’s sold in the bottled herb and spice aisle of supermarkets and has pleasing smoky, earthy, slightly sweet taste with a medium spice level. It’s fairly intense, so you don’t need to add a lot of it to give the mojo prawns a nice chili flavour.

Citrus also flavours the two side dishes I served with the prawns, lime cilantro rice, and Mexican-style street corn salsa.

The rice is easy to make and starts by lightly toasting the grains in hot oil.Water and flavourings are added, including lime zest and juice, and the rice is cooked until tender. You then fluff the rice with a fork and mix in chopped fresh cilantro.

The salsa is inspired by the crema slathered, cheese topped grilled corn on the cob sold by street vendors in Mexico. In this case, though, the corn is cut off the cob, charred in a hot skillet, and then mixed with the style of ingredients that street corn might be flavoured with.

For an even more filing meal, you could serve the prawns, rice and salsa with warm corn tortillas or tortilla chips, for scooping things up.

Note: All of today’s recipes do have cilantro in them, not just the rice. It’s a pungent herb that people either seem to love or loathe. If you’re in the latter camp, although the flavour of the dishes won’t be the same, you could replace it with an equal amount of mild tasting, chopped fresh, flat leaf (Italian) parsley.

Mojo Prawns

Quickly marinated, seared prawns are flavoured with a palate-awakening mixture of citrus zest and juice, garlic, spices, honey, butter and cilantro.

Preparation time: 25 minutes, plus marinating time

Cooking time: about three minutes

Makes: two servings

12 to 16 large, wild prawns (or shrimp), peeled and deveined (see Note)

1 Tbsp olive oil

1 large garlic clove, minced

1/2 tsp finely grated lime zest

1/2 tsp finely grated orange zest

1/4 tsp ground chipotle chili powder

1/4 tsp ground cumin

* pinch or two salt

1/4 cup orange juice

1 Tbsp lime juice

2 tsp honey

1 Tbsp butter, at room temperature

2 to 3 Tbsp chopped cilantro

4, 1/2 lime slices, for squeezing

Place prawns, oil, garlic, zests, chipotle chile powder, cumin and salt in a bowl and toss to combine. Let prawns marinate 20 minutes. While they marinate, combine the juices and honey in second, smaller bowl.

When prawns have marinated, set a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. When skillet is very hot, add the prawns and cook and sear them about one minute. Turn prawns over and cook about 30 to 60 seconds on the other side.

Pour juice mixture into the skillet, along with the butter and cilantro. Cook until the butter is melted and prawns are cooked through, about 30 to 60 seconds more.

Divide prawns and its sauce between two serving plates or dishes. Garnish with lime slices and serve.

Note: To peel a prawn (or shrimp), hold the end of the tail in one hand and use your other hand to grab onto its swimmerets, the little legs under the shell. Pull off the shell, leaving the very bottom portion of the tail intact. If the prawn was not sold deveined, now use a small paring knife to make a lengthwise slit along the back of the prawn. Pull out, or rinse out with cold water, the dark vein, if there is one, pat the prawn dry, and it’s ready to cook.

Lime Cilantro Rice

Lightly toasted rice steamed and flavoured with bright-tasting lime juice and zest, aromatic, emerald green cilantro and a hint of ground cumin and garlic.

Preparation time: 10 minutes

Cooking time: About 20 minutes

Makes: two to three servings

2 tsp olive oil

3/4 cup long grain white rice

1 small garlic clove, minced

1/4 tsp ground cumin

1 cup + 2 Tbsp water

1/2 finely grated lime zest

1 Tbsp + 1 1/2 tsp lime juice

1/4 tsp salt

1/3 cup chopped cilantro

Heat oil in a small pot set over medium to medium-high heat. Add rice and cook, stirring occasionally, for three to four minutes, until rice is lightly toasted. Mix in the garlic and cumin and cook 30 seconds more.

Add water, zest, juice and salt to the pot and bring to a boil. Cover rice, reduce heat to its lowest setting, and steam 15 minutes, or until tender. Fluff rice with a fork, mix in cilantro, and serve.

Mexican-style Street Corn Salsa

Smoky-tasting, skillet charred corn is featured in this salsa richly flavoured with such things as sour cream, tangy cheese, lime and cilantro.This recipe could be doubled or further expanded, if you wanted to serve a larger bowl of the salsa with tortilla chips.

Preparation time: 15 minutes

Cooking time: three minutes

Makes: about two, 1/2 cup servings

1 Tbsp olive oil

1 cup fresh corn kernels (see Note)

1/4 to 1/2 tsp minced garlic

1 Tbsp sour cream

1 Tbsp mayonnaise

2 Tbsp chopped cilantro

1/8 tsp ground chipotle pepper powder

1/2 tsp finely grated lime zest

1 Tbsp lime juice

2 Tbsp finely crumbled feta cheese

Place oil in a 10-inch cast iron or other heavy skillet set over medium-heat.When oil is hot, add corn and cook and stir until lightly charred, about three minutes. Mix in garlic and cook 30 seconds more.

Transfer corn to a shallow bowl and cool to room temperature. Add remaining ingredients and mix to combine.Cover and refrigerate salsa until ready to serve. It can be made many hours before needed.

Note: One medium to large cob of corn, after shucking and cutting the kernels off the cob, should yield the one cup needed here.

Re: “Painting all police as being racist,” letter, Aug. 20.

A letter writer concluded that since Canadian police forces include people of colour that systemic racism is not possible.

article continues below

I urge the writer to look beyond the individuals within the system, and instead look at the systems themselves. Systems founded on oppression, discrimination and misogyny cannot help but be reflected in written and unwritten codes of conduct, workplace culture and behaviour.

We cannot change the past that the present is reflected in. Acknowledging the existence of systemic racism does not discredit the good work of many police officers – but it allows them to change and shape organizations to be less racist in the future.

Our capital city is in embarrassing condition

For the first time in many months we ventured to Victoria for dinner and walk-about. We were shocked at the condition of the streets. I felt like I was driving in a northern Interior town after a long rough winter; the washboard, potholes, faded lines. We are not talking about the side streets — this is all the main streets leading into the downtown (Blanshard, Douglas, Government).

For the capital of British Columbia, this is an embarrassment. Surely while tourism is down, traffic is down, the municipal and provincial politicians would take the opportunity to improve the roads and clean up the capital city.

This city is looking dirty and unkempt. Dallas Road, once the scenic tour drive and pride of Victoria, is a mess. The park walkway is unkempt and is a dirty backdrop to a once beautiful waterfront.

Lowering our standards and letting everything deteriorate does nothing to draw people to the city. There has to be a balance struck between maintaining our capital, where it reflects the pride of our province, not a race to expose the underside of our growing homeless population, making our streets and parks and our city representative of what we have to offer.

Please open your eyes and see what we see and clean up the city.

Children could put parents at risk

It makes sense that parents are scared. Imagine having a condition or being a survivor of something that makes your immune response weaker. Any parent in this segment would already have worried about what if they could not work or passed away. Who will look after my kids? Now they will have that same worry as they send their kids to school. What if this is the start of the end of my life? Who will take care of my children? Why am I sending my kids now?

Kids will contract COVID-19 and they will spread it to their families.

When, not if, a parent or grandparent does contract COVID-19, how will we explain to the children that their parent is in ICU or worse because they went to school?

Give parents a break. Let them make their choices. For some it is life or death.

Why this radish is so large and round

Re: “Garden radishes can be enjoyed all winter,” Aug. 22.

A footnote to Lee Reich’s interesting article on garden radishes in Saturday’s Times Colonist.

He mentioned the Sakurajima variety as being particularly big and round. Sakurajima is the name of a volcanic island in Japan, out in the bay opposite the city of Kagoshima on the southern tip of Kyushu .

The volcano is very active, erupting 300 days a year and constantly spreading ash over the houses and cars of the many people who live there. They simply sweep off the dust and get on with their lives.

This often involves growing vegetables in the fertile volcanic soil including the Sakurajima variety of radish, or daikon as it is called in Japanese. The interesting aspect of the Sakurajima radish is that it is the same variety as the normal white long legged Japanese daikon we are familiar with but when it pushes its root down into the volcanic soil it encounters ever hotter temperatures. It therefore redirects its growth into its circumference and becomes very large and round, with a well deserved reputation for succulence and flavour.

Runners and the mist they leave behind

In these peculiar days of distance, masks and heightened social courtesy in an already courteous town, each day as I walk the lovely Ogden Point breakwater, dutifully following the posted “stay-plague-free” advice, I am at a loss to understand the mindsets of those who jog past everything and everyone, mask-less of course, as they steam on through us all leaving their panting shrouds of mist and droplets floating in the fresh ocean air. Why?!

Lower speed limits will limit disabled

Saanich Mayor Fred Haynes wants to lower the speed limit on city streets to 40 km/h from 50 km/h – a 20 per cent decrease.

For Handydart drivers this means a 20 per cent decrease in our speed and while we spend about 60 per cent of our time on city streets this means about 50,000 trips will be lost in a year or about a 1,000 trips a week gone.

For the disabled community this is unacceptable for any reason.

I hope other mayors will read this and understand the grave situation this idea will leave our most vulnerable.

Victoria has done a lot of this nonsense and the difficulties at Handydart have greatly increased because of these decisions.

Feel lucky enough to open schools?

Perhaps as a person with no children, and no skin in the game, I perhaps may presume to comment on the issue of sending children back to school in the middle of a pandemic.

We have already seen the results of sending children back to school in various countries, for example, from the terrible example of Israel, to the better of example of Denmark.

It seems that the better examples are a result of more stringent requirements of lower class size, masks, spacing, and so forth. These better requirements are of course more expensive. Thus we should demand of our provincial government a cost/benefit analysis of their school reopening plan; for example, how many children do their plans project will be infected, to how many will they spread the disease, and how many people will sicken and die as a result. These projections have been publicly lacking, subjected to feel-good stories of homilies and sermons.

For the parents, of course, there is only one question. Are you feeling lucky?

Fifty people indoors is too many

Why are we allowing gatherings of up to 50 people indoors? This seems far too many. How can they possibly maintain distance with those numbers? Also, once you allow that many it is easy to see how it could rapidly escalate via social media.

I see Hawaii is considering limiting indoor gatherings to ten only. I think we should be reducing our allowable gathering size to a much smaller number than 50.

Wear masks and face shields

Why is it that I am still walking into grocery stores and drug stores and finding most customers not wearing a mask or a face shield?

Grocery aisles are not being monitored, even with arrows on the floor, and personnel are in tight groups chatting around the customer service counter.

Either we are serious about this virus or we are not. I just don’t see managers of some stores making much of a move to enforce rules.

People should not be walking around grocery stores and pharmacies with no masks or shields. Someone has to start making rules and sticking to them.

We need help from the province to enforce these rules.

Sow the seeds outdoors in March, weather and soil conditions permitting. Store the seeds over the winter in a labelled envelope placed in a dry, dark, uniformly cool place. I use the cupboard beside my north-facing front door, where temperatures stay cool.

Dear Helen: Are Burdock plants aggressive weeds? On walks through my rural Saanich neighbourhood I’ve noticed a patch of the plants, now grown about 120 cm tall and starting to flower. Should I be concerned about them?

M.B.

Burdock is invasive. It is listed as a noxious weed in several interior areas of the British Columbia mainland where the plants have become troublesome. They grow up to two metres tall, with erect, branched stems and large, heart-shaped, wavy-edged leaves.

Burdock is a biennial, meaning that the plants flower and set seed in their second year, but they can live for up to four years. The plants produce lavender-purple flowers from July to October, followed by round, bristly, clinging burs. Every plant can produce up to 16,000 seeds over its lifetime.

The key to preventing burdock from spreading is to cut the plants down before they flower, so that no seeds can be produced. The seeds spread easily as hooked spines on the burs (seed capsules) cling fast to clothing and to passing animals

It is thought that burdock was introduced from its native Eurasia in the 1700s, as food and medicine. The entire plant is edible. Young leaves are used like spinach, the flower stalks like celery, tender first year taproots in soups and stews.

Dear Helen: Honeysuckle has always been one of my favourite flowers, but my small yard has no room or suitable site for it to grow well. Can honeysuckle be grown and maintained successfully in a container?

B.B.

Almost any plant can be grown in a container if the container is large enough, but honeysuckle will not grow as well in a pot as in the open garden. If you decide to try, use the largest pot or tub possible. Keep the plant well watered, and fertilize regularly. Pruning helps to confine the plant, with a main pruning in late winter.

Though most honeysuckle vines are fairly rampant, one of the newer ones, called Peaches and Cream, is more compact than most. I came across this variety quite by chance. A gardener I’d helped with some advice came by one day with a Peaches and Cream plant she’d just bought. She asked me to do prune it back for her before she planted it.

A rooted cutting made from a pruned stem gave me a plant, which has proven to be very easy-care. I keep stems with faded flowers cut back, and prune it back almost to the framework stems in late winter or early spring. It produces highly scented, dark purple-red and cream flowers through spring and summer. I notice that Monrovia, a major supplier of plants to our local garden centres, recommends Peaches and Cream for growing in containers.

Consider contacting a few of your local garden centres to see which ones stock this plant. Honeysuckle can be planted in either early spring or early autumn, but for growing in a container I would opt for a spring planting. A newly potted plant might not fare well in a cold winter. Plant as early as possible in the spring to give the plant time to root well while the weather remains cool.

Dear Helen: In Europe, covering gardens in rocks to reduce work and the need to water — a practice seen often in gardens here — is discouraged as people are urged to plant pollinator flowers in any space they have. Crop yields here and throughout North America have been limited by a lack of bees and other pollinating insects. Do you agree that stone gardens should be discouraged?

H.C.

I agree with environmental groups and gardening organizations that everyone who can should consider seeding patches of “pollinator” flowers to help expand populations of the insects upon which much of our food supply depends.

I think encouragement, with an emphasis on the beauty, easy care, and urgent importance of such plantings is the best path to increasing the presence of pollinator-friendly flowers in our gardens."

Our strata corporation held an information meeting a week ago regarding the use of our facilities to determine what measures we can take to enable the opening of our clubhouse and outdoor pool.

article continues below

The strata council has held a position of keeping everything closed, but our residents and their guests and contractors walk through our lobby, common areas and use our elevators daily, so why would the use of our common facilities be a higher risk than the transient use of our common areas?

Do you have examples of how other strata corporations are managing this situation?

DK Wilson, Kelowna

British Columbia hosts a broad variety of strata corporations by location, design, size and density. For this reason, every strata council and community will need to assess what is the best solution for the health and safety of its residents.

Best practices don’t necessarily demand the closure of our facilities or require us to cease general operations, but they do require us to critically assess the risks of exposure that may arise from access to common areas and facilities.

Before your strata corporation opens your common facilities to users, develop management protocols for contact tracing, cleaning and sanitization schedules, and a community response in the event there is a COVID-19 outbreak in your strata corporation.

You are correct, the risks of exposure may be higher from transient users of our properties than the collective residents safely using common facilities.

It is possible to safely manage the use of pools, gyms, recreation rooms, guest suites, libraries, terraces, gardens and interactive common use areas, but it requires a collective investment by the community, close monitoring to ensure the protocols are observed, and a focus on the best interest of safety of all residents.

Before you consider opening your facilities, walk through the spaces and observe all the potential contact locations where the virus may be spread and locations where social distancing may not be possible. These will be your target areas to manage use of space, sanitization, or perhaps closures to avoid higher risks.

Set down a written policy on janitorial functions and sanitization. When will the areas be cleaned, who will clean them and what frequency will products be applied? Distribute and install hand sanitizer stations around your common areas.

Consider a mask policy for the protection of everyone in your community. Social distancing is realistically not effective in elevators and in most common area corridors. Follow the public health officer’s lead on social distancing and mask applications for public spaces.

Strata common areas, after all, are the public spaces of your community. The recommendations are for the collective protection of all residents.

A strata council may adopt new rules during the year, and the options around the use of common facilities and requirements such as social distancing, use of masks and regulations on access to common amenities can be included in those rules.

The intention is not to create an enforcement model but to ensure everyone in your community is well informed with the same information. Print new policies and rules, distribute them to all owners and tenants and post them in obvious locations. If you establish new rules, review your existing rules and bylaws first to confirm you are not imposing contrary conditions. And remember, rules do not apply to strata lots.

To assist your community, CHOA has posted sample guides for mask policies, how to respond if there is an outbreak in your community and a pool management policy. Go to the COVID section of the CHOA website.

If it is established, the new BIA would be mainly centred around Commercial Street, including feeder streets up to that area. “It’s really very much a centre-of-city initiative,” Kim Smythe, chief executive of the Greater Nanaimo Chamber of Commerce, said Monday.

It would be independent of two other downtown associations, one in the Old City Quarter and another for the Victoria Crescent area, he said.

A new BIA would create an “organization that actually does speak on behalf of the businesses that are focused around the core of the city. Once they have a voice then they can advocate for themselves at city hall. They can market themselves because they are a compact shopping precinct unto themselves,” Smythe said.

“They can start to drive what they want to see down there in terms of events and promotions and marketing, security and beautification.”

There hasn’t been a BIA in Nanaimo since 2017.Council voted early that year to halt more than $230,000 in annual grants, which matched the amount the organization received from its members. Nanaimo decided to pull its grants after an outside review found it was rare for local governments to fund BIAs.

A few months later, the organization voted to close.

After the previous BIA folded, the Chamber stepped in as an advocate on behalf of downtown, Smythe said.

“About a year ago, we started to work towards re-engaging the downtown business community members and pursuing a BIA,” he said. He anticipates that this fall, a petition will go out to property owners for them to vote on whether they want to be part of a BIA.

A new non-profit society has been formed called the Downtown Nanaimo Business Association.

If the petition is successful, then Nanaimo council would pass a bylaw in the new year and it would be official by July 2021.

The levy is based on property value, with thepercentage determined by city hall, Smythe said.

Success in a petition requires 50 per cent of the owners representing at least 50 per cent of the property value within a specific area.

Council is on a summer break, set to return in September, but Helps said she is calling the meeting because the situation around 24/7 sheltering in parks isn’t working for anyone.

article continues below

“Unfortunately, it’s not as easy as simply enforcing the [7 a.m. to 7 p.m.] camping bylaw without a better plan in place. … Because where will 300 people go all day with all of their things?” she said in a text message.

Like other indoor spaces during the pandemic, shelters and agencies serving homeless people have had to reduce their capacity to slow the spread of COVID-19.

The meeting will be closed to the public so council can receive legal advice. Helps said any decisions about bylaws will be made at a meeting open to the public when council resumes on Sept. 3.

Many residents have called on the city to return to enforcing the camping bylaw, which requires people to pack up their tent and belongings every morning by 7 a.m. Council voted to suspend enforcement of the bylaw during the pandemic to ensure people have a place to self-isolate.

Friends of Beacon Hill Park Society, which aims to protect the park’s natural and cultural history, plans to sue the city over the decision to allow 24/7 sheltering.

The society has launched an online fundraising page to collect donations to pay for legal action against the city, raising more than $3,800 as of Monday afternoon.

Roy Fletcher, president of the society, said the decision to allow 24/7 sheltering violates the terms of the park trust, because the park is intended to be for “the use and enjoyment of the public,” rather than for utility.

“Camping is utility. It’s establishing a permanent home in a park, and telling people this is your home and you can defend it as you need to. And some people in the camp, of the campers, are taking this very seriously. They think this is their permanent home,” Fletcher said.

He said there have been people sheltering overnight in the park for years, and he would be satisfied if the city began enforcing the bylaw again to prohibit daytime camping.

Only Coun. Geoff Young opposed the decision to suspend enforcement, but now at least one other councillor says she would support reinstating the time limit on sheltering.

Coun. Charlayne Thornton-Joe said she was originally in favour of the decision to allow 24/7 sheltering in parks, because the pandemic reduced shelter beds and closed day programs for people who are homeless. Thornton-Joe said her decision was also informed by guidelines for municipalities provided by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry that said “clearing or moving encampments without providing shelter/housing immediately can cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers.”

Since the vote to suspend bylaw enforcement, more than 340 people have moved into motel rooms funded by the province and many day programs have reopened. Thornton-Joe said it’s those changes, as well as the growing frustration and safety concerns voiced by residents about the encampments, that has changed her mind.

“It’s just becoming too entrenched, and safety issues for the public and for those that are even camping is now raised to a level that has brought me concerns, and it’s been a concern for a little while for me.”

Young said council has received “floods of emails” complaining about interactions with campers, theft, people casing buildings, discarded needles and garbage. He said packing up every day is inconvenient for those living in tents, but campers have become too entrenched in the park, with large structures and collections of big items, like furniture, barbecues and generators. He said council has received many letters from park users who say campers treat them like “interlopers” trespassing in their home.

“From the point of view of impacts on the park environment and other park users, it is absolutely preferable to prohibit day-time permanent camping,” Young said.

Advocates for the homeless say that an end to 24/7 sheltering will disperse a large group of people with nowhere to go, transferring the issue somewhere else, instead of solving anything. “Where would they put their tents during the day?” said Julian Daly, CEO of Our Place, adding that shelters are “pretty full” because they’re operating at limited capacity to meet physical distancing requirements.

Daly said many people would likely lose their tents, because they would have nowhere to store them during the day.

“If they lose that … that’s their home right now. They don’t have any access to other shelter right now, so if they lose their tent, they lose their shelter. It’s as simple as that, really.”

He said forcing people to pack up in Beacon Hill Park will see campers move to other parts of the city, sending the concerns of Beacon Hill Park neighbours to other areas.

“We do understand the fears and concerns that citizens have about camping. I get that. I really do. But at the same time, we’re also concerned for those who have the camps as their only home, and what that would mean toww lose even that meagre home,” Daly said.

“Really as a society, we’ve got to sort this once and for all, so that the people who are feeling fearful about people camping don’t need to have those fears anymore, because the people aren’t camping there, because they’ve been found homes, permanent homes. That way I think everyone would be happy.”

Kelly Roth, executive director of the Coalition to End Homelessness, said forcing tenters to pack up every morning would lead to people travelling from place to place through Victoria streets looking for a place to rest, whether in other parks, in doorways, or other places that feel relatively safe. “I’m not saying encampments are the ideal situation, but having 250 people or so wandering the streets every day, every night looking for a place to be is not a solution either.”

Roth said overdose deaths — which hit record levels in May and June, killing 346 people in B.C. in two months — would likely increase if those camping in the park had to pack up and move along every morning, because people who are now living in a community could find themselves isolated and using drugs alone. Breaking up the community would also make it more difficult for outreach workers and health care professionals to provide help to those in need, she said.

“It’s one thing when you know where someone is and can get to them with prescriptions or with whatever kind of a medical program they’re on. Once they’re moving and the outreach workers that work in harm reduction are just trying to find them, that’s going to be challenging,” Roth said.

Dr. Theresa Tam made the comments during a news conference Tuesday while responding to the Statistics Canada survey, which found nearly one-quarter of respondents unlikely or unsure whether they would get a COVID-19 vaccine.

Many experts and political leaders have touted the successful development and widespread rollout of a vaccine as essential for an eventual return to normalcy, including the full reopening of economies and ending physical distancing.

More than 76 per cent of respondents in the Statistics Canada survey indicated they would likely get inoculated if and when a vaccine is ready. Yet 14 per cent said they were somewhat or very unlikely to do so. Nine per cent remained unsure.

Those who indicated they were unlikely to get a vaccine were asked to identify the reasons for their reluctance. More than half cited a lack of confidence in its safety while a similar number said they were worried about potential risks and side effects.

About one-quarter of respondents, who were allowed to give more than one answer, said they did not consider it necessary to get the vaccine while about 10 per cent indicated they did not believe in vaccines at all.

More than one-third said they would likely just wait until the vaccine seemed safe.

The survey also indicated younger Canadians and those who don't have a university degree are more likely to be hesitant or nervous about a vaccine than those who are older and more educated.

The crowd-sourced survey of around 4,000 Canadians was conducted between June 15-21. It cannot be given a margin of error because the participants do not represent a random sample.

Asked about the survey, Tam underscored the importance of ""vaccine confidence,"" describing it as integral to the successful rollout of vaccine.

She went on to promise that regulators won't take any shortcuts with safety despite the government agreeing to several changes to the clinical-trial process to get a potential COVID-19 vaccine developed faster.

""Just because it's an accelerated process to get vaccines for Canadians does not mean we're going to shortchange anything on safety and effectiveness,"" Tam said. ""I do have confidence in our regulatory system.""

Tam also took aim at the spread of falsehoods about vaccines online.

""I do think social media and internet companies do have responsibilities in terms of their role in the space,"" she said.

""So I would look towards different partners, different government departments also coming together to look at how we better address some of the misinformation that's in that space.""

She is not the first to speak out on this issue, as some have blamed the growing number and influence of anti-vaccination groups online for a resurgence in childhood diseases such as measles.

Facebook announced last year that it would be cracking down on so-called ""anti-vaxxer"" groups, which included labelling posts deemed as containing false information about vaccines. The social media giant now being sued by one such group in California.

Josh Greenberg, a communications professor at Carleton University who has been studying Canadians' attitudes towards a COVID-19 vaccine, said safety concerns aren't unexpected, given the pressure governments and industry are facing to get something working fast.

Yet he said it is essential that Ottawa push back against misinformation campaigns, which have been growing in numbers and influence even as governments around the world have been slow to react.

""When you look at issues like COVID-19 and the campaign to ready or prepare the public for the eventual release of a vaccine, you're talking about a battle for both hearts and minds,"" Greenberg said.

""It's not just an information battle of trying to make sure that people have accurate information, but that you are persuading them in such a way that they trust the veracity of the information you're providing and they also trust the source of that information.""

While the world is rushing to find a vaccine for COVID-19, new reports of several people having been reinfected with the novel coronavirus after testing positive once before raise concerns that it might be a moving target.

Deputy chief public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo said the cases in Hong Kong, Belgium and the Netherlands highlight ongoing questions about immunity to COVID-19 and the need for an effective vaccine.

Canadians will now qualify for EI after working as few as 120 insurable hours, the equivalent of about 3.5 weeks, in the last 52 weeks.

EI claimants will receive a one-time credit of about 300 insurable hours for claims, if they have lost their job, or 480 insurable hours, if they have taken leave for a sickness, pregnancy or parental, compassionate care or family caregiver reasons.

Those credits will be available for one year and retroactive to March 15 for claimants who wanted to switch from CERB to EI maternity, parental, compassionate care, family caregiver or work-sharing benefits, but were stopped because they did not meet the hourly requirements.

How much money will people receive?

New EI claimants will receive at least $400 per week or $240 per week for extended parental benefits, if this is higher than their benefits would otherwise be.

Previous EI claimants were given 55 per cent of their average weekly earnings, up to a maximum $573 per week in 2020.

What is happening to the EI premium rate?

The EI premium rate is being frozen for two years at $1.58 per $100 in insurable earnings for employees and $2.21 per $100 in insurable earnings for employers.

What if I'm self-employed or don't qualify for EI?

The first of the three new benefits is the Canada Recovery Benefit for workers who are self-employed or not EI-eligible and still require income support because their work has not yet returned due to COVID-19.

This benefit will provide $400 per week for up to 26 weeks, while claimants continue to look for work.

They will be able to earn income from employment or self-employment while receiving the benefit, but need to repay 50 cents of every dollar earned above an annual net income of $38,000 through their income tax return.

The benefit will be available Sept. 27 and paid in arrears.

What if I get sick or have to isolate for COVID-19?

The government will offer the new and temporary Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit to provide income support for workers that are sick or must self-isolate because of COVID-19.

The benefit will offer $500 per week for up to two weeks and cannot be received while claimants are also taking paid sick leave.

It is also available Sept. 27 and paid in arrears.

What if I have to look after kids or family member?

The government has announced the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, a new and temporary program for workers who must miss work to care for a child under the age of 12, a family member or dependant because schools, daycares or day program facilities are closed due to COVID-19.

This benefit offers $500 per week for up to 26 weeks per household. It may be shared, but only one member of a household at any time can receive the benefit at a time.

Workers who prefer to keep dependents at home when facilities are open are not entitled to the benefit, which is effective Sept. 27 and paid in arrears too.

The crisis payments for about 58,000 low-income seniors on the B.C. Seniors Supplement were introduced by the province in April, and extended in July and will now continue to pay out four more months until December.

“COVID-19 isn’t going away any time soon,” said Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction Shane Simpson. “Essential costs are increasing in many cases so this is an opportunity to ease that pressure and we see it continuing so we’ll go through December.”

The seniors supplement for a single person is an unfathomably low $49.30 a month, said B.C. seniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie. With the supplement, it becomes $349.30 a month for the lowest-income seniors living on about $19,000 or less a year. For context, a minimum-wage job would bring in about $26,000 a year.

Mackenzie said the boost is substantial and in her mind hasn’t received the attention it’s due.

“It’s very significant for the group of people receiving this money, it’s a lot of money for very low income people,” Mackenzie said.

For a senior couple the supplement would be $120.50 and $49.83 for a spouse receiving the federal Old Age Security allowance.

“We have to find a way to continue to support these really low income seniors after COVID,” said Mackenzie.

“They were struggling before COVID, and they’re going to struggle after COVID and hopefully this will be a catalyst or a way to address this lowest income group of seniors.”

The temporary $300 crisis supplement is extended four months September through December to low-income seniors receiving the B.C. Seniors Supplement and income assistance and disability recipients residing in special care facilities.

The B.C. Senior’s Supplement tops up the federal government’s Old Age Security and/or the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).

The B.C. Seniors Supplement is not available to people who are already receiving federal employment insurance or the $2,000 monthly Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).

No low- or no-income people are still disproportionately affected by this pandemic, said Simpson.

The top up considers that seniors are paying more in prescription dispensing fees, additional travel costs for seniors avoiding public transit due to health concerns, and delivery fees for groceries.

Mackenzie said seniors are also spending more on groceries because they can’t shop around for the best prices as they did prior to the pandemic and seniors who relied on accessing the internet for free at public libraries are now having to order internet services.

Earlier this year, the Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $2.5 billion one-time, tax-free top-up payment to help 6.7 million seniors absorb costs related to COVID-19.

For April to June 2020, the maximum combined payment from OAS plus GIS is $1,514.78. The maximum for OAS is $613.53 OAS and the maximum for GIS is $916.38 GIS per month, for a single person.

The federal one-time lump-sum payment saw seniors who receive Old Age Security in Canada receive a $300 payment. Those who receive the guaranteed income supplement for low-income seniors saw an additional $200.

“I just think it’s a bunch of B.S.,” Nate Christian told CHEK News. “I had a party man, it wasn’t even a party, it was like a hangout. I gave everybody hand sanitizer, I took everyone’s name down, I showed the cops that and they did not care, they said whatever you are getting the ticket.”

Officers were called to the multi-unit residential building in the 1000 block of Fort Street twice on the weekend.

On Friday night, an estimated 40 to 60 youth were packed inside the one-bedroom suite, police said, and the room was so crowded and hot there was condensation on the windows and the party attendees were sweating.

The host was issued a $2,000 fine, plus a $300 victim-surcharge levy.

Police returned early Sunday after receiving a noise complaint. This time, a guest was arrested for obstructing a peace officer fined $230 for violating the COVID-19 Related Measures Act.

The 18-year-old male guest refused to co-operate and leave when police broke the party up, said VicPD Const. Cam MacIntyre.

“It’s disappointing and frustrating,” MacIntyre said. “It’s incredibly reckless.”

Christian said there were fewer people in attendance the second night and some were wearing masks. He said the only rule he failed to follow was the one about physical distancing.

“It wasn’t that many people, man. It’s not like I had 250 people not wearing masks — 80 per cent of the people in the house were wearing masks,” he said.

“In this small space [we can’t socially distance] … but that’s why we kicked people out because the cops were coming. So no, we weren’t following it, but when the cops came here there were only 15 people here. ”

Christian, who has been evicted, said he plans to fight the ticket.

“I am fighting them in court,” he said.

“Me and everybody who was at this party are going to testify and say we were a metre and a half apart like we spread it out and everything.”

But, he said, he is sorry: “Everyone is mad at me for it, literally all over B.C. And it’s just like, I’m sorry. It wasn’t that many people, man. It’s not like I had 250 people.”

Several tickets were also handed out in the Lower Mainland over the weekend.

Surrey RCMP said one restaurant, two event and banquet spaces, and an after-hours club were each given $2,300 tickets over the weekend, after they were caught contravening health officials’ orders about groups.

Police said all four venues had previously been issued warnings, and were among 429 checks conducted over the weekend for COVID-19 compliance.

In Richmond, police found significantly more than 50 people in a private sports centre.

A Richmond RCMP spokesperson said officers initially took “an educational approach” — as they did with several other private gatherings over the weekend — “but it was quite clear that the business needed further incentive to comply” with public health orders.

The operator of the facility was hit with a $2,300 violation ticket under the COVID-19 Related Measures Act.

Premier John Horgan said it was “disappointing” the tickets were necessary, “but we will not stand by and let a small number of people undo the hard work of British Columbians to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Thank you to the vast majority of people doing their part to keep each other safe.”

Police can recommend charges if violation tickets do not prove to be effective deterrents, or in cases of egregious contraventions or for repeat offenders. On conviction, penalties of up to $10,000 may be levied, according to the province.

“I said: ‘How did you get back here … You’d better go home now … I’m not going to let you in,” says Wright, who was crouching down to speak to the animal. “I’m standing there [less than a metre away] thinking I’m talking with a yellow lab.

“Then he turned and I said: ‘Oh hell, you’re not a dog.’ ”

Wright had in fact had a very close encounter with a cougar at 10:30 p.m. that evening, likely the same big cat that had been reported on North Dairy Road in the Hillside Centre area the day before.

The back porch light of her Carman Street home wasn’t working, but there was enough light coming through the glass door for her to see the cougar’s face, large body and long tail as it slipped into the night.

Saanich police arrived within five minutes and scouted the area but found no sign.

Two hours later as she closed her bedroom curtains, she spotted the cougar again, lying under a bush in her front yard.

“It was really a shock,” Wright said in an interview Friday. “I was checking the glass [on the deck door] for a nose print because he was right there. I’ve seen cougars in the zoo and TV … not that close.”

The Carman Street Block Watch Association sent emails to residents warning them to be on the lookout for cougars.

Another Saanich resident, Edna Hilton, said she was awakened the same night in her Torquay Drive home by a strange sound coming from outside her bathroom window at 3 a.m.

“It was like a cat, an agitated cat, but coming from something much bigger,” said Hilton.

From her dining room she could see deer running by. She moved to her living room window and saw a cougar chasing the deer. “[The cougar] moved so fast,” she said.

There have been other cougar sightings this week in Saanich near Prospect Lake and Rithets Bog.

Rick Dekelver of the B.C. Conservation Officers Service said cougar sightings have been on the increase in urban areas, and it’s likely they are pursuing their ­natural prey, deer, as that ­population increases in residential neighbourhoods.

He said cougars are not scavengers and prefer to hunt for their food. They are most active from dusk to dawn and often lay low during the day, finding cover in bushes or trees. People may pass by them without even noticing.

But they will travel in daylight because they are curious by nature, sometimes cutting through yards. “If there is something that comes within their comfort zone, they will flee,” said Dekelver.

He said cougars might also try to grab pets such a s cats and small dogs, so it’s important for residents to be watchful of their pets at all times, including those evening bathroom breaks outside.

Wright does not have any pets, but she does have water fountains in her back yard where the big cat might have stopped to rest and drink. One of her neighbours in the back along Service Street also has several cats that cut through her yard on a regular basis, and the cougar might have been watching for one to appear.

Dekelver said people should be vigilant in the evening hours. If they encounter a cougar, the first rule is never to run because it might consider you prey. “Back away slowly and speak in a loud voice,” he said.

“Don’t scream or have a shrill voice. It may think you are prey. Look big. If you have a jacket, pull it up with your arms. Pick up your child to make your silhouette bigger.

“It may have a kill that it is protecting.”

Dekelver said the presence of deer — or their sudden disappearance — is a good indicator of whether or not there is a cougar in the area.

“If you go from seeing six deer on a regular basis to nothing for a week or so, it could be a sign. [Deer] often know about cougars a lot sooner than [humans] do.”

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""","INVERMAY, Sask. — People could always tell when Aaron Ogden entered a room.

The 19-year-old had a big presence, said his father, Mark Ogden. He was a prankster, a one-of-a-kind character who would sit and talk to anybody as if he'd known them for years.

article continues below

""He wasn't afraid to make friends,"" Ogden, 50, said in a phone interview. ""This is just the way he was.

""Really easy to talk to.""

People remembered the young man's outgoing personality at his funeral this week. He died in a Calgary hospital last Saturday after collapsing on a run.

His father, a trucker, was able to be by his son's side.

He said a major blood clot had formed around a stent placed in his son's aorta. The stent was necessary after he survived a serious highway accident on his way to work last year.

""It was a miracle, really.""

Ogden said while in hospital before his death, his son told him he was supposed to go for a CT scan in June while still living in Saskatchewan near Yorkton.

It was a routine checkup on the stent, but the appointment was postponed because of restrictions around the COVID-19 pandemic and never rescheduled.

""I didn't think nothing of it at the time, but I mulled it over ... as we watched him decline,"" Ogden said.

""It hit me. He was trying to tell me: 'This shouldn't have happened.'""

The father believes that had his son's scan not been cancelled, doctors might have found the blood clot in time.

Ogden wants all postponed hospital procedures done immediately.

""People's lives are being lost,"" he said. ""These COVID rules are way too far.""

Ogden believes the Saskatchewan Health Authority bears responsibility for his son's death.

""Somebody needs to be held to account.""

The health authority halted hundreds of non-urgent surgeries, procedures and diagnostics in March to brace for the pandemic.

Two months later, when the government felt it had a handle on the spread of the novel coronavirus, it announced the resumption of health services would be staggered.

""Emergency and urgent patients are the priority for services, including diagnostic imaging,"" said Corey Miller, vice-president of provincial programs at the health authority.

""The determination of the priority is based on the evaluation of the referring physician in consultation with the patient.""

Miller said they are reviewing Ogden's case and have reached out to his family.

He said the health authority is working through the backlog of exams that were delayed during the first few months of the pandemic.

More than 1,500 CT appointments which had been booked were postponed, he said.

Ogden questions why something like a CT scan couldn't be performed in Yorkton, where the risk of COVID-19 was low.

As of Friday, health officials reported five active cases in the region, which has only seen 33 infections in total since the pandemic hit Saskatchewan.

Cheryl Camillo, a professor with the University of Regina's Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy, says speaking generally, delaying non-essential services to respond to COVID-19 was the responsible thing to do because the virus was new and spreading quickly.

""The risks are that some people don't get the essential and urgent services because so much of the workforce and the resources of the health system move towards responding to COVID,"" said the health systems researcher.

""It's very human for people to get frustrated because health care is something that is so personal.""

She says another risk of scaling back is that people can lose confidence in a health system some may perceive as having overplanned for the pandemic.

Health officials are in the tough spot of having to prepare for the worst case scenario and what could be a rapid change in case numbers, she says.

During the pandemic Camillo's own grandmother died in a long-term care home in the United States from isolation and depression, she says.

""I suffered an individual loss of my otherwise pretty healthy grandmother, but despite how profoundly sad that makes me, I understand and would defend the care home's decision to lock down.

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""

Dec. 1: Canadian authorities arrest Meng at Vancouver's airport after an extradition request from the Americans. The news becomes public on Dec. 5.

Dec. 6: China demands Canada release Meng and ""immediately correct the mistake"" officials made in arresting her. The Chinese say they were not briefed on the reasons for Meng's arrest. In Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Meng's case is part of an independent legal process with no outside political influence.

Dec. 7: Meng appears in a Vancouver court, where allegations of fraud are laid out. The U.S. alleges Meng misled American banks in a bid to get around American sanctions on Iran.

Dec. 8: Canada's ambassador to China, John McCallum, is summoned to a meeting with China's assistant foreign minister so the country can register complaints about Meng's arrest.

Dec. 9: China summons the American ambassador to China to lodge similar complaints about Meng's case and demand the U.S. rescind the order for her arrest.

Dec. 10: Chinese authorities arrest two Canadian men. Michael Kovrig, who was on leave from Global Affairs Canada, and entrepreneur Michael Spavor. Kovrig's arrest becomes public on Dec. 11. Spavor's becomes public on Dec. 12.

Dec. 11: Meng is released on $10 million bail. U.S. President Donald Trump tells Reuters that he would ""certainly intervene"" in Meng's case ""if I thought it was necessary"" to help forge a trade deal with China.

Dec. 12: China's foreign ministry says it has no information about Kovrig but says the organization he worked with — the International Crisis Group — was not registered in China, making its activities in the country illegal.

Dec. 13: Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, says the arrests of the two Canadians were plainly a response to Meng's arrest. China's foreign ministry says Kovrig and Spavor have been detained on suspicion of ""endangering national security.""

Dec. 14: Canadian officials are granted consular access to Kovrig, and McCallum meets with him in Beijing.

Dec. 16: Canadian diplomats in China are granted consular access to Spavor.

A source familiar with the conditions of Kovrig's detention says he is questioned three times a day and kept in a room with the lights on continuously. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland formally demands both men be let go, calling in a statement ""for their immediate release."" Similar statements come out from the United States, Britain and the European Union.

Dec. 24: China's foreign ministry calls out the U.S., Britain and EU, saying the trio should be condemning Canada for Meng's arrest.

2019

Jan. 3: At a news conference, China's prosecutor general Zhang Jun says Kovrig and Spavor ""without a doubt"" violated Chinese law. He says the investigation is also following the rule of law but doesn't provide more details about the allegations.

Jan. 7: The Prime Minister's Office says Trump has affirmed his respect for judicial independence. In a summary of a phone call between Trump and Trudeau, the PMO indicated the leaders discussed the high-profile U.S. extradition request — though Meng was not named — and agreed on the importance of respecting the independence of judges and the rule of law.

Jan. 9: China's envoy in Ottawa suggests Canada and its Western allies are white supremacists for calling for the release of two Canadians imprisoned last month by his country's communist government. Ambassador Lu Shaye makes the accusation in an op-ed in the Hill Times.

Jan. 14: Trudeau says he's very concerned to see China ""acting arbitrarily"" by applying the death penalty to a Canadian convicted of drug trafficking. He says Canada will do all it can to intervene on Robert Lloyd Schellenberg's behalf when a court in Dalian in northeastern Liaoning province announced it had given Schellenberg the death penalty after reconsidering his case.

Jan. 15: China expresses its ""strong dissatisfaction"" with Trudeau over his criticism of Schellenberg's sentence. Trudeau should ""respect the rule of law, respect China's judicial sovereignty, correct mistakes and stop making irresponsible remarks,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying says.

Jan. 16: The U.S. State Department says China's death sentence against Schellenberg is ""politically motivated."" A statement says U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Freeland spoke and ""expressed their concerns about the arbitrary detentions and politically motivated sentencing of Canadian nationals.""

Jan. 17: Ambassador Shaye says Canada's arrest of Meng was an act of ""backstabbing"" by a friend. Lu warns of ""repercussions"" if Canada bars the firm from its new 5G network for security reasons, as have three of its intelligence-sharing allies.

Jan. 18: Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale says the government's decision on whether to ban Huawei from being used in Canada's next generation 5G wireless network will not be influenced by threats of retaliation from China.

Jan. 22: China demands the U.S. drop a request that Canada extradite Meng. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Meng's case was out of the ordinary and Canada's extradition treaty with the U.S. infringed on the ""safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens.""

Jan. 23: Ambassador McCallum says there are strong legal arguments Meng can make to help her avoid extradition to the United States. Speaking to Chinese reporters a day earlier in the Toronto area, McCallum listed several arguments Meng's legal team can make in her defence.

Jan. 24: Trudeau dismisses calls to remove McCallum following his comments to Chinese reporters, saying such a change wouldn't help the two Canadians detained by Chinese authorities get home any sooner. Later, McCallum says he ""misspoke"" when he suggested detained Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou had a strong case to avoid extradition to the United States.

Jan. 25: McCallum tells StarMetro Vancouver it would be ""great for Canada"" if the United States drops its extradition request. ""We have to make sure that if the U.S. does such a deal, it also includes the release of our two people. And the U.S. is highly aware of that,"" he told the Star.

Jan. 26: McCallum resigns as ambassador to China at Trudeau's request.

Jan. 28: The U.S. Department of Justice formally levels criminal charges against Huawei, two subsidiaries and Meng. The charges, contained in two newly unsealed indictments, allege that Huawei misrepresented its ownership of a Hong Kong-based subsidiary to circumvent American sanctions against Iran. Furthermore, they say Huawei stole telecommunications technology, trade secrets and equipment from U.S. cellphone provider T-Mobile USA. Meng is charged with bank fraud, wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit both. In a statement, Huawei denied committing any of the violations cited in the indictment.

Jan. 29: The Canadian government says it has received a formal request for the extradition of Meng, who appears in a Vancouver court to change the people who are providing her with some of the financial sureties for her release.

March 1: The Justice Department gives the formal go-ahead for the extradition case to proceed.

March 3: Meng's defence team announces it has filed a notice of civil claim alleging ""serious violations"" of their client's constitutional rights.

March 4: China accuses the two detained Canadians of acting together to steal state secrets. Trudeau dismissed the allegation made in Chinese state media, saying: ""It is unfortunate that China continues to move forward on these arbitrary detentions.""

March 6: A lawyer for Meng tells a judge the United States bid for extradition raises serious concerns about the political motivations behind the case.

March 14: Huawei pleads not guilty in a New York court to charges accusing it of plotting to violate Iran trade sanctions. Lawyers enter the plea in federal court in Brooklyn, two weeks after Huawei pleaded not guilty to separate federal charges filed in Seattle accusing the company of stealing technology from T-Mobile.

March 22: A judge orders the RCMP to provide copies of the content on seven electronic devices owned by Meng after they were seized when she was arrested. Justice Heather Holmes of the British Columbia Supreme Court says the RCMP must make copies of data on an iPhone, an iPad, a Macbook Air, a Huawei phone, two SIM cards and a flash drive.

March 29: The federal government says it is considering subsidizing farmers hit by China's $2-billion ban on Canadian canola imports.

April 29: Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe says Ottawa needs to treat Chinese imports with the same scrutiny China is showing Canada's canola shipments.

May 1: The federal government changes a payment program for canola farmers to help those affected by China's decision to ban the Canadian product.

May 2: China suspends the export permits of two Canadian pork exporters, including Quebec-based Olymel LP, amid growing tensions between the two countries.

May 8: Meng's defence team tells a judge it plans to argue that she shouldn't be extradited to the United States because she hasn't committed fraud under Canadian laws and her arrest was unlawful.

May 9: Canadian diplomats are joined in a Chinese courtroom by American, British, French and German colleagues to watch an appeal in Schellenberg's case.

May 16: China says it has formally arrested Kovrig and Spavor, bringing them closer to trial on vaguely defined state security charges. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman says they have been arrested for allegedly stealing state secrets. Goodale says the federal government is ""deeply concerned"" about China's decision, adding that no evidence has been produced to indicate any validity to allegations made against them.

May 23: China's ambassador to Canada says the bilateral relationship is at ""rock bottom"" compared to any time since diplomatic ties were first established decades ago. In prepared text for a speech, Lu Shaye says he's saddened Canada-China relations are at what he called a ""freezing point.""

June 5: Lawyers for the RCMP and Canada Border Services Agency deny allegations that their officers searched Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou's phones and electronic devices after a border official wrote down her passwords. A joint response filed in court to Meng's civil lawsuit says a border officer asked Meng for her phone numbers and passwords in case he was required to search the devices for customs or immigration purposes. Meng's civil lawsuit filed in B.C. Supreme Court alleges ""serious violations"" of her constitutional rights and accuses officers of detaining and questioning her for three hours before notifying her of her arrest.

June 13: Freeland rejects the purported view of former prime minister Jean Chretien that the extradition request be cancelled to improve relations with China and win the release of Kovrig and Spavor. Freeland said while she respects Chretien, Canada is either a rule of law country or it is not. Chretien's comments were reported in the Globe and Mail citing anonymous sources.

June 24: Defence lawyers for Meng ask Ottawa to stop the extradition process against their client, saying the request made by the United States was for political purposes, not legitimate law enforcement reasons.

Aug. 20: Court documents released ahead of Meng's extradition hearing suggest a Canadian border official questioned her about her business before the RCMP arrested her. The nearly 1,100 pages of material released by the court were collected by Meng's defence team.

Aug. 21: Meng's lawyers allege Canadian officials acted as ""agents"" of American law enforcement while she was detained at Vancouver's airport for three hours ahead of her arrest. In court documents, they point to handwritten notes by Canadian officers indicating Meng's electronics were collected in anticipation of a request from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States.

Sept. 4. Business consultant Dominic Barton is named as Canada's new ambassador to China.

Sept. 23: The Crown says Canadian officials followed the law when they detained Meng and the defence has no proof to substantiate its ""conspiracy theory"" that she was illegally arrested. The Attorney General of Canada says in court documents that there's no evidence to suggest that the RCMP or the FBI asked border agents to elicit information from Meng during the detainment.

Sept. 24: A lawyer for Meng says there was nothing ""routine"" about the way she was questioned by border officials before she was read her rights and informed of her arrest as Meng's defence team asks the B.C. Supreme Court to compel the release of further documents to support its arguments ahead of her extradition hearing in January.

Oct. 1: A Crown prosecutor tells a judge Canadian border guards mistakenly gave the RCMP passcodes to electronic devices belonging to Meng when she was questioned at the Vancouver airport. The Crown says when the border agency realized it had made a mistake, it told the RCMP the codes could not be used or shared because they'd been obtained during a border examination.

Oct. 29: The federal government says Canada's new ambassador to China has met with Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

Oct. 31: In documents, Meng's lawyers maintain there is an ""air of reality"" to an allegation the RCMP illegally shared details of her electronic devices with the FBI, despite new affidavits from the Mounties denying the claim.

Nov. 5. A Chinese ban on the import of Canadian pork and beef products estimated to have cost farmers almost $100 million is lifted.

Nov. 24: Canada's new foreign affairs minister spends an hour in talks with his Chinese counterpart over the fate of Kovrig and Spavor. Francois-Philippe Champagne spoke with China's Wang Yi a day earlier at a G20 meeting of foreign ministers in Japan.

Nov. 28: Lawyers for Meng say the United States is ""dressing up"" its complaint that she violated sanctions as a case of fraud as they ask the B.C. Supreme Court to decline her extradition. In court documents released, Meng's legal team says the alleged misrepresentation does not amount to fraud and the transactions processed by HSBC were not illegal in Canada.

Dec. 2: Meng says she has experienced feelings of helplessness, torment and struggle since being arrested, but no longer fears the unknown. In a post on the Chinese telecom company's website, Meng says she has passed the time on bail in one of her homes in Vancouver reading books, chatting with colleagues and painting.

Dec. 10: Justice Minister David Lametti says he is troubled that Kovrig and Spavor have been denied access to lawyers as they face trials where convictions are virtually assured. Meanwhile, Meng wins an application in the B.C. Supreme Court for more documents to be disclosed as she alleges there was an abuse of process during her arrest.

2020

Jan. 23: A lawyer for Meng argues the extradition case against her is a test of whether courts will reject foreign charges that run contrary to Canadian values as a hearing wrapped up in the B.C. Supreme Court. The hearing focused on the legal test of double criminality. Crown counsel Robert Frater says the judge does not necessarily need to consider American sanctions law for the allegations to amount to fraud in Canada.

March 13: Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese Embassy in Canada says Kovrig has been allowed to have a telephone conversation with his father, who is very ill. The embassy says in a statement that they allowed the call for humanitarian reasons, and it also says Kovrig and fellow detainee Michael Spavor are being given better food to strengthen their immunity against the novel coronavirus.

May 27: Holmes rules against Meng on the double-criminality argument. The B.C. Supreme Court judge says the allegations against Meng could constitute a crime in Canada.

June 15: Lawyers for Meng accuse authorities in the United States of misleading the B.C. Supreme Court judge presiding over the extradition case. Meng's defence team says it is seeking a stay in the proceedings arguing that U.S. case records are ""grossly inaccurate and based on deliberate and/or reckless misstatements of fact and material omissions, thereby constituting a serious abuse of the extradition process.""

June 19: China charges Kovrig and Spavor with spying. Kovrig was charged in Beijing on suspicion of spying for state secrets and intelligence. Spavor was charged in Dandong city near the North Korean border on suspicion of spying for a foreign entity and illegally providing state secrets.

Aug. 25: Meng loses her battle to have the contents of six confidential documents released to her legal team after arguing in Federal Court that the redacted documents would support the position that their client suffered an abuse of process during her arrest. Justice Catherine Kane says the information contained in the documents is not relevant to the allegations of abuse described by Meng's legal team.

Last week, we discussed the major equity indices used around the world. We also addressed the terminology used and highlighted some of the pitfalls of monitoring the returns on indices.

article continues below

Exchange Traded Funds are commonly referred to as ETFs. They first emerged as a passive investment approach to mirror some of the major indices.

During periods of uncertainty, we prefer to have an active approach versus a passive approach. Individually selecting securities is preferred over buying an entire index. We have written articles in the past on the pros and cons of holding ETFs, mutual funds, or direct holdings. The purpose of this article, however, is to once again outline our concern with equity ETFs when markets are reaching near historic highs.

On Nov. 29, 2019 we wrote a similar article — Ten reasons to be cautious with Canadian equity ETFs — when the TSX Composite Index (TSX) was at 17,040. Within four months, the TSX Composite Index dropped to 11,173 (or a decline of 34.4 per cent). Once again, markets are approaching all-time highs, despite market uncertainties (i.e. COVID, economic decline, corporate earnings, political uncertainty, trade uncertainty, etc.).

We felt it prudent to revisit the reasons we feel investors should be cautious with index equity investing.

Equity ETFs that cover the broad market naturally have a Beta close to one. This means they are equal to the risk of the market. When the markets are doing well then ETFs will track that. Using the S&P/TSX 60 Index (XIU) as an example, it has a beta of 1.04 — higher than the S&P/TSX Composite Index. In June 2008, the XIU was $22.81 per share. In March 2009, the XIU traded as low as 11.41 per share. The XIU essentially dropped 50 per cent. The S&P/TSX Composite Index hit a high of 15,154 in June 2008 and declined to a low of 7,480 in March 2009. A decline of approximately 51 per cent. After the markets have had an extended run, we get particularly nervous about equity ETF style investing. Are you prepared to accept the complete downside of the equity market if it pulls back quickly?

Advocates of ETF investing are proud to highlight the returns that equal the market. I’ve never felt that the end goal of investing is to just own the market and have returns equal to the general market. Our objective at the beginning of every single year is to beat the market. Beating the market really comes down to not having an equal position in everything. You have to concentrate on a much smaller group of stocks and exclude everything else. Our end goal is to have our equities outperform the general market – not just equal the market.

I’m not convinced that a completely hands-off approach is the best approach. If you are using ETFs then we feel that you still have to manage the ETFs to ensure you’re in the correct ETFs. When we hold individual holdings, we can shift the holdings, making good strategic allocation decisions, based on economic conditions. By strategic allocation decisions I mean asset mix (per cent in cash, fixed income and equities), sector exposure, geographic exposure, and tax efficient strategies. We feel that there is extreme value in having a good portfolio manager that can help you make both tactical asset allocation and strategic asset allocation decisions.

Although ETFs are a lower cost option when compared to mutual funds, they do have costs. There are costs when you purchase and sell. They also have embedded costs within the ETF. The embedded costs with an ETF are lower than mutual funds. If an investor is seeking the lowest cost option then buying individual equities and never trading them is the lowest long term cost option. You have a one-time cost of purchasing them with no ongoing costs. We don’t recommend this approach because we feel the markets are changing and you have to adjust the equity holdings accordingly. We also feel that rebalancing and making both tactical asset allocation and strategic asset allocation decisions enhances returns. We feel couch potato investing (buy ETFs and do nothing) is not the best option for investors who have discovered working with a Portfolio Manager.

Some ETFs will have hundreds or thousands of holdings. In our model portfolios we typically limit the number of equity holdings to 25 to 35 individual common shares. We prefer to focus on the best companies and concentrate on those holdings rather than spreading the capital out over hundreds or thousands of names. I strongly believe that concentrating on the best names is a better strategy than having numerous small holdings.

We encourage investors to avoid Canadian ETFs that hold American stocks. To illustrate, we will use an investor named Jill that owns 14 individual common shares of US companies within her Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP). The US and Canada negotiated a tax treaty that exempts any withholding tax on US dividend income generated within an RRSP. Another investor named Jack decides to purchase a Canadian ETF that holds American dividend paying common shares. As the common shares are held within an ETF, it does not fall under the exemptions listed in the tax treaty. As a result, a 15 per cent withholding tax is applied on all dividend income within the ETF. This 15 per cent withholding tax is an absolute cost and is lost to the investor.

A typical client will have a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), RRSP, and a non-registered investment account (either Joint With Right of Survivorship, or Individual). In our July 26, 2019 article, we discussed placement of investments in registered and non-registered accounts. This article focused on how to get the best tax benefits from structuring your investments correctly. Individual Canadian equities that pay dividends are best in a non-registered account to claim the dividend tax credit. Individual US dividend paying equities are best in an RRSP account. The article has many tips that we help our clients with. An ETF investor often has the same holdings in each account without giving thought to the best tax structure. The ironic part about this is that the ETF investor may be saving a small amount in the ETF fee, but losing even more in tax savings by fixating only on fees.

Many companies are introducing actively managed ETFs. When I hear the term “actively managed ETFs”, I feel it is essentially moving in the direction of a mutual fund. Many mutual fund companies are also creating passive strategies as well. Many ETFs are moving towards the mutual fund space to justify slightly higher fees, and many mutual funds are moving towards the ETF space by reducing fees and hoping not to lose market share on fee-sensitive investors. These two investment worlds are somewhat colliding. Some ETFs are claiming that they have designed built-in Algorithms. This sounds really fancy and it sounds passive. Back-testing data does not guarantee future results, similar to the mandatory mutual fund disclosure that past performance is no indication of future performance. Prior to purchasing either, it is important to know all the details and consider all options, including holding individual positions with a Portfolio Manager.

ETF investors have the option of holding one or more ETFs. Both have shortfalls in my opinion. If you are holding only one ETF – which ETF would you hold? If you purchase XIU, for example, then you are completely missing everything outside of Canada. On the flip side, some ETF investors will hold several different types of ETF holdings. They may hold a sector ETF, a broad market ETF, and an ETF that holds only dividend-paying equities. As a Portfolio Manager we have tools that retail investors do not have. What we have discovered when we have used these tools is the haphazard approach of combining random ETFs can result in duplication of the underlying holdings and there may be good opportunities that the ETF investor has no exposure to. The more ETF holdings an investor has, the more challenging it becomes to monitor the sector exposure, geographic exposure, and individual company exposure. This becomes even messier when you mix mutual funds and ETFs together.

Similar to a mutual fund, it is a little harder to get excited about following your investments when you are not able to see your individual holdings. We find that when our clients hold the individual companies, they are actually engaged in the investment process. Our clients can see the 25 to 35 holdings they own, follow them in the news, and read the annual reports if they so choose. When you hold both ETFs and mutual funds, that excitement and level of monitoring is somewhat lost. Many of our clients will put the stocks they own in their phone and they can easily track the current price, read recent news, and see the dividends from the companies come into the account. We can print out an income report which will show them the number of dividends they are expected to receive in the year ahead. With mutual fund and ETF investing, I find that this engagement element is somewhat lost as everything is wrapped into one structure, making it hard to visualize the underlying holdings. We feel the more engaged any investor is with respect to their investments, the better the long-term results.

When you buy an ETF for your portfolio, you take away a lot of options for yourself. If you need to withdraw funds from your portfolio and you are only holding a Canadian Equity ETF, then you have put yourself in a position with no choice but to sell the ETF to raise funds whether the market is at all-time highs (creating potential capital gains) or at annual lows. With a well–diversified portfolio of individual holdings, you have the ability to pick and choose which holdings to sell given the market conditions at the time when you require funds.

Asset allocation adjustments are always better done when equity markets are at higher levels. With the many market uncertainties listed above, we have increased cash and increased fixed income in the short term (potentially up to 2 years). We have also selected a smaller number of equity holdings. We feel that this strategic adjustment and active approach will help our clients weather the current environment, especially when compared to an equity ETF or index investing strategy.

Diaz’s early goal had the effect of opening up play — PFC had eight shots on target to Valour’s seven — as the Manitoba side was on the back foot early and knew it needed to find a response to Diaz’s quick goal. Irving and the PFC defence, however, was having none of it.

It was a personally notable night for PFC’s Marco Bustos, the Canada-capped striker, who scored seven goals last year for his hometown Valour FC side.

Valour FC is named after a street in Winnipeg, which was renamed Valour in honour of three Victoria Cross recipients in WWI who hailed from it. The Manitoba club is 1-2-1.

It was an emotional day for PFC. Before the game, Pacific head coach Pa-Modou Kah issued an impassioned video plea on OneSoccer for racial equality.

“Take it to heart. I am standing in front of you as manager of Pacific FC. But my heart is bleeding because my people are suffering,” said Kah, who is Black.

“If you care about me, care about my people. Stand up for what is right. Deep down in your heart and your soul, you know what is going on around the world is wrong. Don’t be silent. We need the movement to continue. We need this change. It’s 2020. Educate yourself. Love each other. Treat each other with respect and stand up for what is right. Be the voice for the young generation coming up. You’re part of the change. Don’t go quiet. In every city you are in, jell together, and be as one. Because we’re all humans. People’s lives matter. Black lives matter.”

Soccer supporter groups, meanwhile, are unmatched in their unyielding passion for their clubs, win or lose. CPL supporters groups are following their teams in various fashions across the country. Pacific FC next plays Sunday at 9 a.m. PDT against 2019 league runner-up Cavalry FC of Calgary and Canada-capped former PFC striker Marcus Haber. There will be a socially-distanced brunch and viewing event at the PFC indoor Island Training Centre in Langford. Tickets are through kkurta@pacificfc.ca.

Robbie died on Tuesday. He was 71.

He was GM for 11 seasons, building a Victoria team that won eight WLA championships and four Mann Cup Canadian Senior A titles with eight trips to the national final between 1996 and 2006.

Robbie was named WLA executive of the year in 1997 and 2001 and WLA general manager of the year in 2003.

“[Robbie] was part of the group that pulled the Shamrocks from the brink of dissolution and saved it,” said current team GM Chris Welch.

“Then he, and the likes of [former team executive] Doug Jones, took it go great heights as one of the flagship organizations in lacrosse. That is the legacy we try to hold onto and maintain each season. Credit for that goes to Lloyd Robbie.”

The franchise had not been to the Mann Cup since 1984 when Robbie’s re-engineered Shamrocks finally made it in 1996, losing in four games to the Ontario-champion Six Nations Chiefs. That was just the prelude. The following year, in 1997, the Shamrocks defeated the Niagara Falls Gamblers in five games at the old Memorial Arena on Blanshard Street to capture Victoria’s first Mann Cup since 1983. That was followed by national titles in 1999, 2003 and 2005.

Robbie’s Shamrocks were led in the early part of the era by the legendary Gait twins with Gary named Mann Cup MVP in 1997 and Gary and Paul co-winners in 1999. Other notable players Robbie later brought in — a potent mix of locally-produced players and off-Island recruits that meshed seamlessly — included Lewis Ratcliff, Anthony Cosmo, Andrew Turner, Ryan Ward, Kaleb Toth, Dan Dawson, Ted Jenner, Tyler Heavenor and Ryder Bateman. Robbie was also a key executive with the Gait-led 1988 Minto Cup national Junior A champion Esquimalt Legion and carried through to 1991 at the junior level before resurrecting the Shamrocks at the senior level.

Over the years, Canadian athletes and players on Canadian teams have brought attention to social and political issues with actions on and off the field of play.

article continues below

Here is a look at some notable moments with Canadian connections:

JACKIE ROBINSON

Brooklyn Dodgers president Branch Rickey stood strong behind the first Black player to play in the major leagues, with Robinson breaking the colour barrier at the top level of the sport when he made his debut in 1947. Robinson was named rookie of the year that season.

A year before that, Brooklyn assigned Robinson to the Montreal Royals, its triple-A affiliate. In April 1946, Robinson became the first Black player to play in a minor-league game when Montreal faced Jersey City. The Royals went on to win the International League title that year.

In 2011, U.S. diplomats unveiled a commemorative plaque at the apartment Robinson and his wife Rachel called home in the summer of 1946.

""You can't make (enough) of the house because it's where the experiment started and the experiment went on to be a national success, so it led to something,"" Rachel Robinson said.

""What was nourished there in that house … had widespread influence in our society.""

1980 MOSCOW OLYMPICS

Canada was one of 66 countries to boycott the 1980 Summer Games because of Soviet-Afghan war.

The decision left just 80 countries in the Olympics.

Canada's call didn't sit well with all of the country's athletes. Former pentathlete Diane Jones-Konihowski was critical of the decision.

Jones-Konihowski, a 69-year-old Vancouver native now living in Calgary, doesn't regret her actions.

""I don't... because it (the boycott) was wrong,"" she said. ""We were still trading wheat with Russia, we were still having Aeroflot planes land (in Canada).

""Suddenly we were a priority with the federal government. We'd never been before... and so I was very, very angry.""

CARLOS DELGADO

In protest of American wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the then-Toronto Blue Jays slugger exited the field during the playing of ""God Bless America"" in the seventh inning of games starting in the 2004 season.

There were brief chants of ""USA! USA!"" when he lined out in the top of the seventh at Yankee Stadium during one game in 2004. During a moment of silence before ""God Bless America"" was played during the seventh-inning stretch, derisive shouts were made in his direction.

The native of Puerto Rico started standing for ""God Bless America"" again when he was traded to the New York Mets before the 2006 season.

""I gave him my views on that subject and I also said I would not put myself in front of the team,"" Delgado said. ""The Mets have a policy that everybody should stand for 'God Bless America' and I will be there. I will not cause any distractions to the ballclub.""

PHOENIX SUNS

During a playoff game in 2010, the Suns, led by Victoria's Steve Nash, wore ""Los Suns"" on their jersey.

The decision to wear the jerseys on the Cinco de Mayo holiday came after a law was passed by the Arizona Legislature and signed by Gov. Jan Brewer that drew widespread criticism from Latino organizations and civil rights groups, feeling it could lead to racial profiling of Hispanics.

""I think it’s fantastic,"" Nash said of ""Los Suns.""

""I think the law is very misguided. I think it's, unfortunately, to the detriment of our society and our civil liberties. I think it's very important for us to stand up for things we believe in. As a team and as an organization, we have a lot of love and support for all of our fans. The league is very multicultural. We have players from all over the world, and our Latino community here is very strong and important to us.""

WNBA PROTESTS

All players from the Indiana Fever, inclduing Natalie Achonwa of Guelph, Ont., knelt and locked arms during the anthem before a 2016 playoff game, following similar protests by NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.

This summer, all Seattle Storm and New York Liberty players walked off the court as the national anthem was played before a game. Longtime Canadian national team star Kia Nurse of Hamilton plays for the Liberty.

The WNBA said in a pre-season press release that all aspects of the game and player outfitting would be dedicated to Black Lives Matter and to honour victims of police brutality and racial injustice.

""That's the most important thing about this season, bringing awareness to the injustices that are going on throughout the whole world really, just having these conversations, bringing light to what's going on . . . being leaders in that aspect,"" Minnesota Lynx forward Bridget Carleton of Chatham, Ont., said.

NWSL PROTEST

The first team professional sport to return to the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic made a statement on its opening weekend.

National Women's Soccer League players from the Portland Thorns and North Carolina Courage knelt during the American anthem in late June as the Challenge Cup tournament opened on national television in Utah.

Longtime Canadian national team star Christine Sinclair of Burnaby, B.C., is a member of the Thorns. Goalkeeper Stephanie Labbe plays for the Courage.

""We took a knee today to protest racial injustice, police brutality and systemic racism against Black people and people of colour in America. We love our country and we have taken this opportunity to hold it to a higher standard. It is our duty to demand that the liberties and freedoms this nation was founded upon are extended to everyone,"" the Thorns and Courage said in a joint statement released before the game.

MATT DUMBA

On the opening day of the NHL's restart during the COVID-19 pandemic in Edmonton earlier this month, the Regina-born Dumba made a speech calling for social and racial justice before kneeling for the American anthem prior to an Edmonton Oilers-Chicago Blackhawks game.

""It was to shed light on the people who've lived through injustice and oppression, especially in my home state of Minnesota,"" the Minnesota Wild defenceman said.

Dumba then raised his fist for both the American and Canadian anthems during his team's first game the next day.

A day after that, four players from the Dallas Stars and Vegas Golden Knights knelt for the anthems.

Kaleidoscope Theatre For Young People hit the road Saturday to kick off three weeks of free performances of Gruff, the company’s first touring production in over a decade and the first outdoor performance in its 46-year history.

Four socially-distanced performances for audiences of 40 patrons were held over the weekend at Dominion Brook Park in North Saanich, which served as the de facto kick-off to the company’s in-limbo 2020-21 season. “Right now, we’re using these to test the waters so see what is possible,” said Kaleidoscope Theatre’s executive director, Pat Rundell.

“We haven’t been a touring theatre company in over 10 years, so it’s a chance for us to re-learn and see what’s possible.”

Gruff — a Puente Theatre production commissioned by Kaleidoscope Theatre in 2013 — will be remounted with a pair of hour-long performances at 2 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Filter Beds area of Beaver Lake Park. Additional free performances will be held at the site twice daily through Sunday, followed by additional performances at Ed MacGregor Park in Sooke (Sept. 3) and Government House (Sept. 4-6).

Several months of preparation wet into planning the puppet musical for families directed by Mercedes Bátiz-Benét, who co-wrote Gruff with playwright Judd Palmer. The all-star assembly includes stars Jana Morrison, Trevor Hinton and Rundell, with music by Brooke Maxwell, who co-wrote with Palmer the lyrics about two goats and a troll and the battle for friendship and environmental preservation.

“It has definitely been strange creating theatre in this environment and having to implement new safety protocols, not only for our actors but also our audience. But this show lends itself perfectly to its time as the actors perform in full face masks. They are distanced the entire time.

The musical was not initially part of the company’s 2020-21 season, but was a late addition when all planned Kaleidoscope Theatre shows were postponed when the McPherson Playhouse was shuttered in March. Rundell is unsure, at this point, what the future will entail, but he’s definitely looking at the success of Gruff and how that will impact upcoming Kaleidoscope Theatre productions in the COVID-19 era.

“If all the stars align, I would love to see a show up by Halloween, if not by Christmas. It’s really exciting to have Kaleidoscope Theatre back in the community. I think there is such a need for entertainment, especially live ent. There has been so much screen time, being able to offer something in person for kids and families is amazing.”

In an emailed statement to The Canadian Press, Crave said it hopes fans will respect the show's message of ""inclusivity and acceptance.""

""'Canada's Drag Race' has an international fan base, and it's unfortunate that some of those fans have let their passion cross the boundary into harassment by posting hateful comments about our queens and judges online,"" said the Bell Media streamer, which debuted the show last month.

The acclaimed author said he enjoys searching the web for must-see sites of a far-off city, checking out the availability of flights and hotels, and calculating the cost of his travel itinerary.

article continues below

But when it comes time to book, King would rather see the world from the comfort of his home in Guelph, Ont.

""I can have a little espresso at my desk, and look all this stuff up, and it often feels like I've travelled there,"" King, 77, said in a recent phone interview.

""If I don't travel again, I don't know that I'll miss it.""

This weariness of wanderlust animates King's new novel, ""Indians on Vacation,"" which hit shelves Tuesday.

The story follows Canadian couple Mimi and Bird on a peripatetic mission across Europe to recover a family medicine bundle that a long-lost relative absconded with a century earlier.

As they drift from one destination to the next, the two must navigate their conflicting tourist temperaments.

Mimi, with her trusty guidebook in hand, believes that travel is ""broadening."" Meanwhile, Bird, like the book's author, is skeptical that there's much to be gained by straying too far from home.

""When we travel, a lot of times, the thing we come away with is we've been entertained,"" said King.

""I don't know that we feel any differently towards the people that we see on our travels. We find them interesting, sometimes even exotic. And for a moment, perhaps we have a kind of broadening. But I think by the time people get home, that's tightened up again.""

If anything, travel can show that prejudice knows no borders, said King, who was born in the U.S. and is of Greek and Cherokee descent.

From mountain towns to major cities, King said he's often confronted by racist stereotypes of Indigenous Peoples while abroad, including a photographer in France who asked him to pose with a pool stick as if it were a spear.

""What they want is that inauthentic historical image that Hollywood has made up over the years,"" said King.

""It's always the one kind of Indian they've got because the others don't play well visually. Me in a T-shirt and a pair of walking shorts — God forbid anybody see me in walking shorts — that just doesn't do it.""

In writing ""Indians on Vacation,"" King said he wanted to ""play against type"" by depicting Indigenous characters who are well-off enough to travel the world, while still engaging with the historic inequities that have made such portrayals a rarity in popular culture.

As the COVID-19 pandemic has closed down borders, King won't have to endure airplane food, forced photo-ops or guided walking tours any time soon.

But he still longs for a time when he could plan his dream vacation — then decide not to take it of his own accord.

""I don't need to go to Ireland,"" King said. ""But I don't like the fact that I can't.""

By putting Parliament on pause until Sept. 23 and the presentation of a new throne speech, the prime minister has effectively shut down the opposition-dominated committees that were looking into the WE Charity controversy.

How big a loss that really is to the opposition parties is debatable.

The latest batch of polls suggests the hit to government fortunes may have started to fade.

For better or for worse, the main players in this saga, from the prime minister on down, have all offered their versions of the events that led to the planned outsourcing of the Canada Student Service Grant to WE Charity.

The most tangible outcome of the controversy so far has been Bill Morneau’s departure from the government. It has undoubtedly accelerated his exit from politics. But in light of the positive reception afforded his successor, Chrystia Freeland, his resignation may turn out to be the opposition’s loss.

In any event, if the WE Charity issue has legs, a parliamentary hiatus will hardly put it to rest.

After Jean Chrétien short-circuited the presentation of the auditor general’s report on the sponsorship program by proroguing Parliament in 2003, the scandal came back months later with a vengeance, poisoning the tenure of his Liberal successor.

As in the case of the sponsorship affair, the Official Opposition can likely count on an officer of Parliament – in this instance, ethics commissioner Mario Dion – to breathe new life into the issue at some point down the line.

Meanwhile though, the momentary suspension of the hostilities on the WE Charity front offers the incoming Conservative leader a much-needed opportunity to start recasting his party. The Liberals are not the only ones who need to change the channel — so does the Official Opposition under its new management.

If the Conservatives are going to have a shot at returning to government, they will have to look and sound less like a pack of attack dogs and more like a government-in-waiting.

On that score, time is almost certainly of the essence. It is not necessary to expect an election this fall to believe that Canada could well go to the polls before the end of next year. If not next month’s throne speech, the presentation of a federal budget in the late fall could pave the way to a winter election.

Whenever the next election does take place, the ballot-box question will almost certainly revolve around who has the best plan to lead Canada through the post-pandemic period.

On that basis, expect the government to draft an agenda and chart a fiscal course that it would be happy to campaign on.

If prosecuting Justin Trudeau and the Liberals was a recipe for electoral success, Andrew Scheer would be about to celebrate his first year as Canada’s prime minister, rather than looking for new accommodations for his family in the nation’s capital.

The approach that did not pay off for the Conservatives in last year’s campaign is even less likely to succeed in the post-pandemic context. Outside the Prairie provinces, the notion that anyone would be a better prime minister than Trudeau has limited traction.

In Canada’s second-largest province, a resurgent Bloc Québécois currently has first call on the non-Liberal vote, with the Conservatives trailing far behind.

If the Conservative party is to improve its standing there, let alone hold on to its current seats, it will have to convince Quebecers that it would offer a better government than the Liberals, not a more strident opposition voice than the BQ.

There has also been a sea change in the Ontario dynamics.

At the time of the last federal campaign, Premier Doug Ford was one of Trudeau’s most vocal provincial critics. Since then, he has become one of Freeland’s biggest fans.

Like his Tory predecessors, Ford has found that having the federal Liberals in power on Parliament Hill is more a blessing than a curse for a provincial government’s political fortunes.

Among the men who led the Official Opposition in the House of Commons over the past 20 years, only Stephen Harper survived an election defeat to go on to lead his party in a second campaign.

As Stockwell Day, Stéphane Dion, Michael Ignatieff, Thomas Mulcair and Scheer can testify, the road from prime-minister-in-waiting to dumped party leader is a short and brutal one.

If the recent past is any indication, Erin O’Toole, chosen Sunday to take the Conservative Party of Canada’s helm, is only guaranteed one shot at unseating the ruling Liberals.

“Uh, no. Because it resembles my sleek physique and how in-demand I am.”

“You do realize that the ‘tuna’ we see in restaurants has a fairly high likelihood of being escolar?” I point out. I refer to the 2018 and 2019 surveys of seafood for sale in six Canadian cities by the international, non-profit ocean advocacy group Oceana. The group found that 44 per cent of the seafood samples tested with mislabelled.

Oceana’s surveys and another study by London,Ontario, students found that “albacore tuna” are often switched out for escolar, a kind of mackerel also known as “the laxative of the sea” for the diarrhea, vomiting and nausea it causes in some people. Japan banned escolar in 1977, but it can be sold legally in Canada if it is correctly identified.

Further, Oceana found that all eight downtown Victoria restaurants surveyed sold mislabelled fish. Of the 15 seafood samples collected from the restaurants, 10 were cheaper fish species than those named on the menu. What was sold as “bluefin tuna” was actually yellowfin tuna. “Dungeness crab” was really Atlantic rock crab. “Sockeye salmon” was dressed-up rainbow trout and steelhead salmon. “Cod” was Asian catfish.

“Okay,” Nature Boy changes tack, “then I’m the Perigord truffle. It’s not as exclusive as the white truffle, but it’s still highly desirable… totally fitting, wouldn’t you say?”

“Your totem-food is a fungus?” I say. “A knobbly, old sock–pungent fungus that looks like dirt?”

“The truffle is the King of Fungi,” he preens.

“Yes… but anytime a commodity or product is hugely valuable, people will be ready to dupe the market,” I say. “And truffles are the highest-priced foodstuff around. They sell for thousands of dollars a pound.”

“And your point is…?”

“Well, valuable truffle species are often swapped out by unscrupulous truffle dealers and traders for more plentiful, less aromatic – and considerably less expensive and less desirable – truffles,” I say. “And then there’s truffle oil. This is usually nothing more than oil flavoured with a cheap, possibly carcinogenic, petroleum-derived chemical. That doesn’t help your truffle-totem brand.”

“Right. How about a fine, grassy extra-virgin olive oil then?”

“You’d want to get it tested. Again, the very limited supply can’t meet demand, and there’s great opportunity for faking quality olive oil.”

I mention the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s (CFIA) 2019 campaign against olive oil fraud, triggered by poor weather and insect infestations that damaged the Mediterranean region’s 2018 olive crop. The CFIA runs an International Olive Oil Council-accredited lab Canada and tests olive oils to identify adulterated and mislabelled product. People along the supply chain hoping to make a quick buck have been known to cut real extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) with canola, corn, peanut or tree-nut oil, replace the olive oil altogether with other oils that have been coloured to look like EVOO, or – even harder to trace, because the olive DNA signature remains the same – old, rancid, and therefore less costly olive oil.

Rancid olive oil is so common in North America that many people have come to prefer its flavour over that of the fresh stuff. They’re willing to top price pay for rancid, too.

“Honey?”

“Yes, dear?”

“No,” he says. “What about honey?”

“You’re fine if you’re stick with being a local, small-producer brand. If you go with imported honey from the big supermarkets, you run the risk of being partial honey–corn syrup or –sugar water mix.”

“Well, is nothing safe!” he exclaims.

“I’d avoid sausages, too,” I say.

He scratched his head. “If it looks like a sausage and tastes like a sausage, isn’t it a sausage?”

“The ingredients are often mislabelled. You know, horse meat instead of beef, or beef, pork or – possibly and – chicken when the label says ‘veal.’” Last year, University of Guelph researchers found 14 per cent of sausage samples selected from grocery stores across the country were mislabelled or contained cross-species contamination of meat ingredients. That’s down from a 2017 study that revealed a 20 per cent mislabelling rate.

“So you’re saying we need to be on guard against imitations, decoys, fakes and frauds,” Nature Boy says.

“Just as there are many Nature Boy imitators, there can be but one true Nature Boy.”

“Accept no substitutions!”"

Re: “Topaz Park neighbours split over fencing left from camp,” Aug. 20.

As a resident on the Pandora corridor, I was interested to read about the Topaz neighbours’ differing opinions about the “blue fencing.”

article continues below

We also have the blue fencing on Pandora and from my (and many of my neighbours’) perspective, the blue fencing is keeping us safe and sane after months of chaos. The city is remediating the Pandora medians (and hopefully checking for contamination) but many of us worry that when the fencing comes down, the tents will go up.

One has only to look at the area in front of Our Place to realize that we are within shouting distance of a repeat performance.

The last paragraph in the article indicates that a city bylaw prohibits overnight camping on the Pandora corridor. However, for some reason, despite our many requests in the past for No Camping signage, there is none.

Even before the COVID disaster, we regularly (apart from the dead of winter) witnessed tents being set up on the Pandora medians, but because the campers typically start setting up after 5 p.m., and bylaw officers don’t work after 5, we have no alternative but to call VicPD, who often have more urgent priorities.

As part of the Pandora remediation effort, the city should erect the signs, but also ensure that their planners engage the neighbourhood in reimagining this beautiful oasis in the city in such a way as to encourage its use by the neighbours and discourage camping. Pandora boulevards and medians are the only green space in Harris “Green.” It should be an attractive and safe area for our residents.

How about a small playground and adult exercise equipment?

Teachers need to find a way

For many years, the B.C. Teachers’ Federation has fought for smaller class sizes. Good for them. With COVID-19, there have been no classes — zero class size.

Unlike many, teachers are still getting salaries and benefits. They need to find a way to provide a critical service, as other have done. Thankfully, many others have found a way.

Yet again another formidable task for Chrystia Freeland: finance minister; as if Foreign Affairs augmented by NAFTA (CMUSA) and deputy prime minister were not enough.

The Liberals will continue to empower Freeland until they find something she cannot handle, and then relegate her to the back benches; say goodbye Bill Morneau!

Don’t yell at fellow Canadians

I’m writing because I want to voice my shock and disgust at 2 incidents involving rude remarks and behaviour while my best friend from Alberta was on holiday in Parksville. In both cases they were from my acquaintances. I could almost dismiss the first as it was a one liner after I introduced her. The second I could not dismiss and it really upset both of us. The offender has been witnessed yelling at Alberta plated cars to “go home”. And then she verbally attacked my friend for being here and made us both feel so uncomfortable and unwelcome. We are all concerned but if we do our part to stay safe then we can get through this. If your response is to yell at fellow Canadians and display bad behaviour then I would say this disgusting behaviour makes me wonder what country I’m living in.

Hartland expansion details were withheld

Re: “Hartland Landfill expansion plans rile neighbouring residents,” Aug. 16.

Regarding your story on the Capital Regional District’s plans to expand Hartland Landfill by excavating and quarrying over a number of years, CRD staff are reported to have insisted that “proposed changes were shared with residents” during a transparent consultation process.

Yet the excavation and quarrying that is planned was described in the strategy consultation document only as “enhancing Hartland’s disposal capacity.”

Nowhere did it mention that there would be blasting and quarrying, with 12 trucks per hour removing aggregate on a long-term basis, likely for years, trucking it through neighbouring communities to wherever it will be disposed of.

Nowhere did it mention that the current policy of using all aggregate onsite would be overturned. This process is described in a later document, released after the initial consultations, as creating an “opportunity to use this excess material in CRD projects around the region” since more rock will be mined that can be used onsite.

No mention of how much aggregate will be removed, over how long a period or where it will be shipped. If the CRD has this information, it is not being shared with the public. Instead CRD staff seem to be focused on conducting a public relations exercise that releases as little concrete information on the impact of these proposals as possible.

Appreciation for our PM and premier

We are so lucky here in Canada — and particularly in B.C. — where we have leaders who are doing their best to take care of regular Canadian citizens during the pandemic. In so many other countries, people are left to fend for themselves without any sort of caring or monetary support.

Prime Minister Trudeau has been going out of his way to try to make sure that all citizens are getting the money they need to survive through these unusual circumstances. It makes me very unhappy to see opposition parties not supporting him and doing their best to undermine him and make him look bad. I’m not saying he’s perfect, but he is doing his best to support us all.

He should be getting our encouragement and gratitude rather than having to endure intemperate recriminations from people like Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre. If Poilievre wants to help make things work well, he should make helpful suggestions that could be gratefully acknowledged by the Liberals and then taken into account before final decisions are made. Co-operation among political parties is the only way forward.

In B.C., Premier John Horgan is focusing on providing services to protect health and safety, on giving immediate relief to people and businesses, and on planning for B.C.’s economic recovery over the long term. That’s the right path for our provincial government to be taking and we need to be cheering them on as well.

My best wishes and a heartfelt thank you to both Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Premier John Horgan. We are fortunate to have you in charge.

The key issue is not homelessness

Re: “Homeless people camping at Beacon Hill are mostly from here,” commentary, Aug. 19.

The writers say that numbers in the recent Point In Time study support the notion that “homeless people are mostly from here.” I beg to differ.

The study found 16 per cent of 1,523 respondents were here less than a year. That’s 244 people, a very large homeless camp. Any reasonable person would assume that similar numbers came to Victoria in previous years and as the authors state, less than half of the respondents have lived here more than five years.

The authors claim that these 244 people came here not because they were homeless, but “because family moved here, to be with family or friends, and to find employment.”

Even if this is true, no one should be moving to one of the most expensive cities in the country without the means to support themselves.

On the truth there is complete silence. This issue we have is not “homelessness” at all. The issues are migration, drug and alcohol addiction and mental health issues. No amount of “affordable” housing will change that.

As the authors indicate, “more than 600 people have been housed indoors since the pandemic began.” Many hundreds more have been housed previously. And still, we have about the same number of homeless as we have had for years, and far higher per capita than any other area in the country.

Until these authors and others face up to the true causes of this issue and deal with them, nothing will change. The record speaks for itself.

As the major increase in the number of new COVID-19 infections appear to be coming from people in the 20-to-40 age group, and as this appears to be a result of drug- and alcohol-related parties, why not raise the legal drug and alcohol age to say 41 until the curve is flattened once again?

Language is major component of power

Re: “Acceptance of words varies with time,” letter, Aug. 20.

Your correspondent overlooks certain important aspects of the situation she criticizes. First, language is not just about expressing thoughts. It is a major component of power. Power that is exercised through varying degrees of deprivation, oppression, exploitation, discrimination, physical beating, etc., against minorities. Reforming the language used to justify these behaviours is not merely about offending people. It is part of a worldwide struggle for social justice.

Secondly, she shows no respect for people on the receiving end of those forms of power. It is not just “a few academics” who aim to reform this kind of language but also thousands of activists and victims of abuse who want to see members of minorities respected for who they are as human beings.

The letter-writer puts herself on the side of “facts” and logic. Empathy and understanding are required if one wishes to educate oneself about the true nature of her topic.

Re: “Plan for reopening schools ­leaving too many students behind,” comment, Aug. 18.

MLA Sonia Furstenau couldn’t have articulated any better the problem that exists with current return to school plans. Districts must look at offering online options that keep kids connected to their school community.

article continues below

It is wrong to expect families to withdraw from their schools to access distance learning, leaving them with the possibility of losing their spot and separating them entirely from the school community they love.

The emphasis has been placed on return to in-class learning as being essential to students’ mental health, but what has not been taken into consideration is the mental health of students and families who are forced to withdraw because they feel it prudent to distance-learn due to individual health risks.

Those families are falling through the cracks. And let’s be realistic. Fall brings a lot of various viruses, and with the current need for students to remain home if sick, their learning will fall behind unless they can safely access learning online while riding out symptoms from home. A better solution exists, so let’s get moving on putting distance learning into place for the benefit of all students, regardless of their circumstance.

A solution for Ocean Boulevard

As a 50-year taxpaying resident of Colwood, I would like to offer a constructive suggestion regarding Ocean Boulevard.

This has been a roadway and bird sanctuary for all the years I have lived here and seen many improvements made to it, with no one suffering angst regarding it being open for residents to commute.

I remember coming for the day as a child growing up in James Bay, and it was a great family outing, even with no washrooms in those days.

Only during COVID-19, with many coming to our area from surrounding municipalities to walk the open roadway, has there been so much controversy over whether it should be open or closed.

There would be no need for those who wish to walk close to the ocean if there were well constructed boardwalks on each side of the road.

There is a pathway on the inside but someone keeps filling it with rocks, which makes it uncomfortable on the feet. This would make our area unique and welcoming to all, there is room for all of us.

Pondering traffic flow near lagoon

Things are changing rapidly in the Esquimalt Lagoon area of Colwood and the debate concerning Ocean Boulevard as a throughway is once again front and centre.

The car versus caring for nature does not have to be an either-or choice.

The almost unstoppable pressures of increased upstream traffic has already made the Ocean Boulevard a chosen bypass route. This volume is not compatible with recreational or park use. The alternative to closure would probably require another bypass through the Royal Roads and National Defence lands. That’s seemingly doable but both groups are notoriously intransigent.

Could the route continue along the Galloping Goose Trail?

It would be interesting to hear from some planning engineers as to what solutions, if any, are on their drawing boards.

Motor traffic not a problem for birds

It has been suggested that keeping Ocean Boulevard closed to thoroughfare traffic would mean walkers would be free from traffic and the Lagoon bird sanctuary will be protected. However, both thoughts are untrue.

Birds Canada conducted a study of the bird sanctuary during the time the beach and road were closed.

They discovered that it is people, their garbage, plastic, and unleashed dogs that are the problem. The study reported that vehicle traffic is not the issue.

A large section of the road has been left opened to support food trucks. Food trucks attract crowds of people along with their garbage.

Closing a large section of the road has also reduced parking along the beach side of the road. On July 5 at 1:30 pm, I counted 200 cars parked between Lagoon Road and the first barrier, so social distancing was hard to maintain. Traffic has not stopped; it just looks different.

Opening daycare makes sense

Re: “Proposed daycare sparks ­dispute between residential tenants and landlord,” Aug. 16.

Integrating a daycare into the purpose-built rental housing building at Cook and Pandora is sound urban planning and something I hope to see replicated in Victoria, which like the rest of the province is suffering from a crippling daycare shortage.

The fact that some residents have filed a formal complaint, saying that they oppose the “constant stream” of yelling and laughing from the children who are poised to use it, and that this is delaying the project, is truly beyond belief. Let’s get on with this welcome addition to our city. The opponents, since they are paying north of $2,000 a month in rent, can certainly find somewhere else to live, free of such noise and perceived inconvenience.

Speed up testing for COVID-19

The COVID-19 testing system is a mess. I recently required a COVID test and was left in limbo for two days while the system processed my doctor’s referral.

In that period I was overwhelmed with anxiety wondering if I’d succumb before getting the test.

If this virus is so bad, testing must be done immediately to stem the potential panic by those possibly inflicted by the ailment. Waiting is torture.

Furthermore, the system should notify the patient regardless of the test’s result.

No real need for Beacon Hill camping

Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps has finally admitted that “it is not appropriate to have people camping across from an elementary school.”

Does this mean that it is appropriate to have needles, feces, broken windows, vandalism and theft on commercial premises, small businesses, homes and residences?

Furthermore, the commentary by Diana Gibson and Kelly Roth (Aug. 19) about the Point in Time homelessness survey states that 84 per cent of the individuals surveyed on March 11 (before the start of the COVID-19 shutdown) had been in Victoria for more than a year. This means that 16 per cent had not.

The article said that more than 600 people have been housed indoors since the start of the pandemic. Recent reports are that 95 individuals are currently living in Beacon Hill park.

Combining these two numbers is 695 and 16 per cent of 695 is 111, in other words if those 111 individuals had not been drawn to Victoria then there would be no need for anyone to be camping in Beacon Hill Park.

Sadly, contrary to the claim by Gibson and Roth, the data shows that Victoria’s housing and homelessness services are drawing people to the region, have increased demand and have made the situation worse.

Hospital staff: Wear those masks

This past week I have had the unique experience of a two-day medical test. The staff were great overall, and we must be very appreciative of the hard work they provide with a smile.

However, I was more than a little surprised and angry when so many of the people I saw at our largest hospital were not wearing masks. If they were walking down the hallways or in a sheltered area, there were lots of no-masks.

There were lots of no-masks patients and others from security guards to reception staff everywhere.

It is hard enough to try to encourage people to take an active personal responsibility in this crisis time, one would be very hopeful that our medical staff and visitors would take up that responsibility and wear a mask.

There are many “services” and small businesses that have signs on their doors “No Mask, no Service.” I can’t visit my optometrist without a mask and they are showing their responsibility.

Why aren’t hospitals?

Fresh figs and making a new friend

With all the ugliness that’s happening, there is so much good in the world. Today there was a knock on the door. A man standing at the door with a small box in his hand and he introduced himself. He introduced his wife who was standing at the end of the driveway.

They said they were refugees from Syria and had only been in Canada a few months. They were walking by and noticed our fig tree. He said he hasn’t had fresh figs since he was in his homeland. He asked if he could take a couple figs.

I told him to take a few as he had the little box in his hands. I ran out before he left and gave him some peaches.

Shortly afterwards the man came by with two of his sons. He gave us a plate of homemade falafels and hummus made by his wife. The little boys about 8 and 10 years were very curious and asked lots of questions. Akmed asked if my husband would be his dad’s friend. My husband said, “We are already friends.”

He said he’s going to have to get the plate back to them but the man said not to worry, he’ll pop around at some point.

This man could’ve just taken the figs — but he didn’t. And it was so kind to bring a gift in return.

Welcome to Canada. I am grateful every day that my mum moved us to Canada and that we live in one of the safest and most beautiful places in the world.

The Special Investigations Unit said six officers were in the 29-year-old woman's home when she fell from the balcony in May, while her mother and brother were nearby.

The lengthy report from the Special Investigations Unit notes that Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked ""important conversations"" about the ways in which police interact with Black and Indigenous people, but says there was no evidence of police wrongdoing or ""overt"" racism in the incident itself.

Director Joseph Martino said race may have been a factor in the events leading up to the death of the 29-year-old, who was both Indigenous and Black, but that examining systemic issues in policing is not his role.

""The task before me was a narrow one — namely, to determine whether there were reasonable grounds, on the evidence collected by the SIU, to believe that any one or more of the officers who responded to Ms. Korchinski-Paquet's apartment committed a criminal offence in connection with her death,"" he wrote.

The Special Investigations Unit said six officers were in the 29-year-old woman's home when she fell from the balcony in May, while her mother and brother were nearby.

The agency's report says Korchinski-Paquet's mother called police to the home because the two siblings were fighting — ""bottles and punches had been thrown"" — and she wanted both of them removed from the apartment.

When the 911 operator asked about any mental health issues, the report says, both Korchinski-Paquet's brother and mother indicated that she had epilepsy and had had seizures earlier in the day.

It says that after police arrived and had conversations with Korchinski-Paquet and several others, the 29-year-old went out onto the 24th floor balcony and tried to cross over to an adjoining one, which is when she lost her balance and fell to her death.

The agency said no officers were on the balcony with Korchinski-Paquet at the time, and there's no evidence the officers committed a crime.

The decision comes after the arm's-length agency interviewed all six officers, along with 15 civilian witnesses.

The agency said investigators also received a written statement from Korchinski-Paquet's father, with whom she had been speaking on the phone moments before her death.

Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked protests in the city and calls to change the way police deal with people experiencing mental health crises.

But Martino noted there are forums other than the SIU that are designed to tackle systemic issues.

Other speakers tonight include senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, who is leaving the White House at the end of the month, and Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn.

A devout Catholic, Pence and wife Karen are expected to carry the evangelical banner into Day 3 of the convention, touting Trump as the best choice for Americans who consider themselves social conservatives.

Democrats seized on the opportunity, deploying the openly gay Pete Buttigieg, one of Joe Biden's former presidential rivals, in a fundraising missive denouncing Pence's ""divisive, anti-LGBTQ politics"" and ""archaic worldview.""

As head of the White House coronavirus force, Pence is also likely to address an issue that has so far received relatively scant attention from convention speakers: the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Tuesday, economic adviser Larry Kudlow spoke of the crisis in the past tense, even though the pandemic continues to rage across the U.S., while only first lady Melania Trump expressed any empathy for the more than 178,000 Americans killed by the virus to date.

""My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one, and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering,"" she said. ""I know many people are anxious, and some feel helpless. I want you to know you are not alone.""

Kudlow, meanwhile, framed the novel coronavirus as ancient history in the U.S.

""It was awful — health and economic impacts were tragic, hardship and heartbreak were everywhere,"" Kudlow said. ""But presidential leadership came swiftly and effectively, with an extraordinary rescue for health and safety to successfully fight the COVID virus.""

Of the racial unrest roiling the country — fuelled this week by another police shooting of an unarmed Black man, this time in Wisconsin — Melania Trump urged protesters to channel their furious energy into positive change, not wanton destruction. She also resisted the urge to ""divide the country further"" by beating up on Democrats.

But she raised eyebrows by framing her husband, notorious for playing fast and loose with the truth, as an honest and authentic human being.

""Total honesty is what we as citizens deserve from our president,"" she said. ""Whether you like it or not, you always know what he's thinking.""

Trump has been putting the power of the presidency under a brazen partisan spotlight, and did so again Tuesday, pardoning a convicted bank robber who now helps prisoners reintegrate into society and presiding over a naturalization ceremony for five new American citizens. His wife's speech was delivered from the White House Rose Garden.

And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's pre-taped speech from a Jerusalem rooftop, coming in the middle of a diplomatic mission, did not escape the attention of some members of Congress. Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is accusing Pompeo of violating federal law by mixing government business with partisan interests.

Authorities implored coastal residents of Texas and Louisiana to evacuate and worried that not enough had fled.

The storm grew nearly 70% in power in just 24 hours to a size the National Hurricane Center called ""extremely dangerous."" Drawing energy from the warm Gulf of Mexico waters, the system was on track to arrive late Wednesday or early Thursday as the most powerful hurricane to strike the U.S. so far this year.

""It looks like it’s in full beast mode,"" said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy. ""Which is not what you want to see if you’re in its way.""

One major Louisiana highway already had standing water as Laura's outer bands moved ashore. Winds began picking up as shoppers rushed into a grocery store in low-lying Delcambre, filling carts with chips and beer. Austin Domingues, 26, said his wife would likely evacuate, but he planned to stay put at his father's farm, where the house is 14 feet off the ground.

""I don’t know if it’s too smart, but we’re going to stay just in case we need to help people out,"" he said.

With time running out, both Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards expressed concerns that not enough coastal residents were taking the dire predictions seriously. In Lake Charles, National Guard members drove school buses around neighbourhoods, offering to pick up families.

Abbott warned that families who do not get out of harm's way could be cut off from help long after the storm makes landfall overnight.

The National Hurricane Center kept raising its estimate of Laura's storm surge, from 10 feet just a couple of days ago to twice that size — a height that forecasters said would be especially deadly.

A Category 4 hurricane can cause damage so catastrophic that power outages may last for months in places, and wide areas could be uninhabitable for weeks or months. The threat of such devastation posed a new disaster-relief challenge for a government already straining to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.

By Wednesday afternoon, Laura had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (225 kph) as it churned about 200 miles (320 kilometres) from Lake Charles, Louisiana, moving northwest at 16 mph (26 kph). Forecasters predict winds will reach at least 145 mph winds but may weaken ever so slightly before landfall.

""Heed the advice of your local authorities. If they tell you to go, go! Your life depends on it today,"" said Joel Cline, tropical program co-ordinator at the National Weather Service. ""It’s a serious day and you need to listen to them.""

On Twitter, President Donald Trump also urged coastal residents to heed local officials. Hurricane warnings were issued from San Luis Pass, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, and reached inland for 200 miles (322 kilometres). Storm surge warnings were in effect from Freeport, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River.

In the largest U.S. evacuation during this pandemic era, more than half a million people were ordered to flee from their homes near the Texas-Louisiana state line, including the Texas cities of Beaumont, Galveston and Port Arthur, and the low-lying Calcasieu and Cameron parishes in southwestern Louisiana, where forecasters said storm surge topped by waves could submerge entire towns.

Edwards lamented that the impending storm meant suspension of community testing for COVID-19 at a crucial time — as elementary and secondary schools in Louisiana are opening and students are returning to college campuses. ""We’re basically going to be blind for this week,"" Edwards said, referring to the lack of testing.

The storm also forced evacuations from an area of the state where there has been a high rate of positive tests.

A National Weather Service meteorologist in Lake Charles, Louisiana — in the bullseye of Laura’s projected path — took to Facebook Live to deliver an urgent warning for people living south of Interstate 10 in southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas.

""Your life will be in immediate and grave danger beginning this evening if you do not evacuate,"" Donald Jones said.

Laura is expected to dump massive rainfall as it moves inland, causing widespread flash flooding in states far from the coast. Flood watches were issued for much of Arkansas, and forecasters said heavy rainfall could arrive by Friday in parts of Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky. Laura is so powerful that it's expected to become a tropical storm again once it reaches the Atlantic Ocean, potentially menacing the Northeast.

Even before dawn Wednesday, officials in Austin said the city had run out of free hotel rooms to offer evacuees and had begun directing families fleeing the storm to a shelter nearly 200 miles farther north. In Texas’ Hardin County, which has more than 57,000 residents along the coast, officials warned that anyone who tried riding out the storm faced days or weeks without electricity.

Becky Clements, 56, evacuated from Lake Charles after hearing that it could suffer a direct hit, almost exactly 15 years after Hurricane Rita destroyed the city. She and her family found an AirBnb hundreds of miles inland.

""The devastation afterward in our town and that whole corner of the state was just awful,"" Clements said. ""Whole communities were washed away, never to exist again. ... So knowing how devastating the storms are, there was no way we were going to stay for this.""

Clements, a church educator, said she fears for her office, which is in a trailer following recent construction.

""I very much anticipate that my office will be gone when I get back. It will be scattered throughout that field.""

The hurricane also threatens a centre of the U.S. energy industry. The government said 84% of Gulf oil production and an estimated 61% of natural gas production were shut down. Nearly 300 platforms have been evacuated. Consumers are unlikely to see big price hikes however, because the pandemic has decimated demand for fuel.

""If Laura moves further west toward Houston, there will be a much bigger gasoline supply problem,"" Oil analyst Andrew Lipow said, since refineries usually take two to three weeks to resume full operations.

Laura closed in on the U.S. after killing nearly two dozen people on the island of Hispaniola, including 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.

Kyle Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, was taken into custody in Illinois on suspicion of first-degree intentional homicide. Antioch is about 15 miles from Kenosha.

article continues below

Two people were shot to death Tuesday night in an attack carried out by a young white man who was caught on cellphone video opening fire in the middle of the street with a semi-automatic rifle.

""I just killed somebody,"" the gunman could be heard saying at one point during the shooting rampage that erupted just before midnight.

One victim was shot in the head and the other in the chest, Sheriff David Beth told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. A third person suffered gunshot wounds not believed to be life-threatening.

In the wake of the killings, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers authorized 500 members of the National Guard to support local law enforcement around Kenosha, doubling the number of troops sent in. The governor's office said he working other states to bring in additional National Guard troops and law officers.

""We were all chanting ‘Black lives matter’ at the gas station and then we heard, boom, boom, and I told my friend, `‘That’s not fireworks,’"" 19-year-old protester Devin Scott told the Chicago Tribune. ""And then this guy with this huge gun runs by us in the middle of the street and people are yelling, ‘He shot someone! He shot someone!’ And everyone is trying to fight the guy, chasing him and then he started shooting again.""

Scott said he cradled a lifeless victim in his arms, and a woman started performing CPR, but ""I don’t think he made it.""

According to witness accounts and video footage, police apparently let the young man responsible for the shootings walk past them with a rifle over his shoulder as members of the crowd were yelling for him to be arrested because he had shot people.

Much of Rittenhouse’s Facebook page is devoted to praising law enforcement, with references to Blue Lives Matter, a movement that supports police. He also can be seen holding an assault rifle.

Other photographs include those of badges of various law enforcement agencies, including the Chicago Police Department. All of the badges have a black line across them — something police officers do with black tape or another material whenever an officer is killed in the line of duty.

In a photograph posted by his mother, he is wearing what appears to be a blue law enforcement uniform as well as the kind of brimmed hat that state troopers wear.

The sheriff told the Journal Sentinel that armed people had been patrolling the city's streets in recent nights, but he did not know if the gunman was among them.

""They’re a militia,"" Beth said. ""They’re like a vigilante group.""

The FBI said it is assisting in the case.

Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who is Black, said in an interview with the news program ""Democracy Now!"" that the shootings were not surprising and that white militias have been ignored for too long.

""How many times across this country do you see armed gunmen, protesting, walking into state Capitols, and everybody just thinks it’s OK?"" Barnes said. ""People treat that like it’s some kind of normal activity that people are walking around with assault rifles.""

Witness accounts and video show that the shootings took place in two stages: The gunman first shot someone at a car lot, then jogged away, stumbled and fell in the street, and opened fire again as members of the crowd closed in him.

A witness, Julio Rosas, 24, said that when the gunman stumbled, ""two people jumped onto him and there was a struggle for control of his rifle. At that point during the struggle, he just began to fire multiple rounds and that dispersed people near him.""

""The rifle was being jerked around in all directions while it was being fired,"" Rosas said.

Sam Dirks, 22, from Milwaukee, said he had seen the suspected gunman earlier in the evening, and he was yelling at some of the protesters.

""He was definitely very agitated. He was pacing around, just pointing his gun in general. Not necessarily at anyone specifically,"" Dirks said.

In other widely circulating video, police can be seen tossing bottled water from an armoured vehicle to what appear to be armed civilians walking the streets. One of the civilians appears to be the gunman who later shot protesters.

""We appreciate you being here,"" an officer is heard saying to the group over a loudspeaker.

In Wisconsin, it is legal for people 18 and over to openly carry a gun, with no license required.

Blake, 29, was shot, apparently in the back, on Sunday as he leaned into his SUV, three of his children seated inside. Kenosha police have said little about what happened other than that they were responding to a domestic dispute. They have not said why the officers opened fire or whether Blake was armed, and they have not disclosed the race of three officers on the scene.

On Tuesday, Ben Crump, the lawyer for Blake’s family, said it would ""take a miracle"" for Blake to walk again. He called for the officer who opened fire to be arrested and for the others involved to lose their jobs.

The shooting was captured on cellphone video and ignited new protests in the U.S. three months after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer touched off a nationwide reckoning over racial injustice.

During the unrest in Kenosha since then, protesters destroyed dozens of buildings, set fires and hurled objects at police, who responded with tear gas on three straight nights.

West, who once backed Republican President Donald Trump, announced last month that he had broken with Trump and would launch his own presidential bid.

Trump won Tennessee’s presidential election in 2016 by 26 percentage points, carrying all but four of the state’s 95 counties.

Perennial candidate Rocky de la Fuente along with Jo Jorgensen and Alyson Kennedy have also qualified as independent presidential candidates in Tennessee. Other candidates are still being reviewed by the secretary of state's office."

The legal team representing Const. Michael Theriault has filed an application to vacate the verdict, arguing the conviction for assault was not available to the court.

Theriault and his brother, Christian Theriault, were charged with aggravated assault and obstruction of justice in relation to a December 2016 incident that left Dafonte Miller with a ruptured eye and other serious injuries.

In a ruling delivered in June, Ontario Superior Court Justice Joseph Di Luca said he could not rule out the possibility that self-defence played a role in the early portion of the encounter.

It was during that period that Miller sustained the eye injury that warranted the aggravated assault charge, he said.

However, Di Luca said the self-defence argument collapsed when Theriault later armed himself with a roughly metre-long pipe and hit Miller in the head as the then-19-year-old was retreating.

As a result, Theriault was acquitted of aggravated assault but convicted of the lesser charge of assault.

The officer was also acquitted on the obstruction of justice charge, and his brother was cleared on all counts.

Theriault's lawyers argue in court documents that assault was not listed as an option on the indictment and should not have been available for a guilty verdict.

Theriault was ""never on notice"" that he was being tried for ""assaultive conduct"" not connected to the eye injury, the document says.

""Given that there was no jurisdiction on this indictment to find the applicant guilty of an assault that was not charged and was not included in the counts on the indictment, it is appropriate for the court to grant this application and vacate the finding of guilt,"" the application states.

The Crown is also challenging the verdict, which was delivered amid ongoing protests against systemic racism and calls to defund the police.

In a notice of appeal filed late last month, prosecutors allege Di Luca ""erred in his analysis and assessment of the defence of self-defence.""

The case sparked multiple demonstrations, and many have denounced the ruling as further proof of anti-Black discrimination in law enforcement and the justice system.

Prosecutors alleged the Theriault brothers chased Miller in the early hours of Dec. 28, 2016, cornered him between two homes in Whitby, Ont., and beat him with a pipe because they wanted to deliver street justice.

The defence argued their clients caught Miller and his friends breaking into the Theriault family truck and wanted to arrest him. They said the two men found themselves fighting for their lives when Miller, who they said was armed with a pipe, attacked.

Di Luca flagged credibility issues with multiple witnesses, including the Theriault brothers and Miller. He found that Miller and his friends were stealing items from cars and that Michael Theriault's initial intention was ""likely not to arrest Mr. Miller, but rather to capture him and assault him.""

Miller was arrested by Durham regional police officers who arrived at the scene, though the charges against him were later dropped. The brothers were charged in the summer of 2017, months after the incident took place.

Toronto police said Wednesday that Theriault remains suspended with pay, and that any potential disciplinary action would take place once the court case is concluded.

Earlier this month, an independent review of the Toronto force's handling of the incident found its former chief, Mark Saunders, breached the Police Services Act by not reporting the incident to the province's police watchdog.

The report also found, however, that Saunders was kept in the dark about the incident for five months.

The force's interim chief, James Ramer, issued an apology for the department's decision not to immediately notify the Special Investigations Unit.

Miller dismissed the apology as a ""public relations exercise,"" and said in a statement that neither he nor his lawyers were notified of the review's findings until minutes before their release.

RCMP in Nova Scotia issued a localized emergency alert a week after the 14-year-old girl went missing with a 47-year-old man she knew. That man was arraigned Monday on one count of child abduction.

article continues below

Police have said they did not issue an Amber Alert because they thought the teenager left with him willingly. They now say new evidence indicates she had been abducted.

Lorraine Whitman, president of the Native Women's Association of Canada, said Wednesday it's a relief the girl from We'koqma'q Mi'kmaq First Nation was found safe, but the case highlights a national problem.

She pointed to the report from the public inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, which highlighted a pattern of police categorizing missing girls as runaways, slowing down investigations.

Whitman says the ""runaway"" stereotype puts underage girls in danger and criteria for alerts should be reviewed to prevent the same delays from affecting another minor.

""They may have ran away, but we have to look at it more in depth,"" she said in an interview. ""We just can't take it as a case that they wanted to leave. We have to look into it because there are more underlying areas that we have to investigate as well.""

The 2019 report on missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls cited testimony from families who ""shared how stereotypes and victim blaming served to slow down or to impede investigations into their loved ones' disappearances or deaths.""

""The assumptions tied to Indigenous women, girls ... by police as 'drunks,' 'runaways out partying,' or 'prostitutes unworthy of follow-up' characterized many interactions, and contributed to an even greater loss of trust in the police and in related agencies,"" the report said.

Whitman also took issue with the RCMP's statement that the girl left willingly from her foster home with the man she knew. She said a 14-year-old can't make that decision on her own, and suggested that if a non-Indigenous, wealthier child had been involved, the alert would have been sent right away.

""This is almost a week after this young girl has been missing, and in the woods,"" Whitman said. ""Our lives are very important as well. She was a minor and the RCMP had a due diligence that they had to follow.""

Video surveillance footage placed the 14-year-old and the man at a gas station in Catalone, N.S., on Aug. 13. Before she was found on Aug. 24, community members had been searching the area and pressuring police for more urgency in finding her and to issue an Amber Alert.

The We'koqma'q chief and council had offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to her whereabouts. Police issued a localized alert to residents east of the Mira River in Cape Breton a week after the girl ran away.

According to the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, Amber Alert programs are provincially operated and only the police can issue them. The criteria for issuing them vary, but the basic requirements include the disappearance of someone under the age of 18 who is suspected of being abducted.

RCMP Cpl. Lisa Croteau said Wednesday that information before the girl was found indicated she had not been abducted. New evidence, however, supports the child abduction charge, she said. Croteau said she could not go into specifics about the evidence because the case is before the courts.

But Croteau said police did not consider an Amber Alert necessary, because they did not believe the man was on the run with the child.

""From the onset of this investigation, we had strong evidence that they still were camping in the Cape Breton area and that they did not intend to leave the island,"" Croteau said.

She cited ongoing talks with the provincial government about the general protocols for sending public alerts to Nova Scotia residents, adding that it's not within the police's power to change them.

Those consultations follow criticism that a provincewide emergency alert was not sent on April 18-19, during the manhunt for a killer who claimed 22 lives in the province. Police were chasing a gunman who was dressed as a Mountie during parts of his rampage.

When asked if the Nova Scotia RCMP detachment would take a closer look at how it approaches cases involving missing Indigenous kids, Croteau said the force treats all missing person cases seriously regardless of race.

Champagne raised the cases of former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor on Tuesday during a meeting with Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Rome, which the Canadian minister is visiting as part of a multi-country tour.

The two Michaels were arrested in apparent retaliation shortly after Canadian authorities in Vancouver detained Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei. She is wanted in the United States on fraud charges.

Meng, who has denied any wrongdoing, is now facing possible extradition to the U.S. while Chinese authorities have indicted the detained Canadians on what many observers believe are trumped-up spying charges.

""I would like to stress once again that things between China and Canada have come to this stage not because of China,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said during a news conference in Beijing on Wednesday.

""The Canadian side is well aware of the crux of the problem. It should take immediate and effective measures to correct the mistakes and create conditions for bilateral relations to return to the right track.""

The comments appear to pour cold water on hopes that Champagne's meeting with Wang in Rome would lead to a breakthrough for the two Michaels.

A summary of the ministers' meeting released by Global Affairs Canada said the two discussed the importance of global co-operation in dealing with COVID-19, including when it comes to developing and rolling out a vaccine.

""Minister Champagne again reiterated that the cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor remain a top priority for the Government of Canada and that Canada continues to call on China to immediately release both men,"" the department added.

Champagne was also said to have asked for clemency for all Canadians sentenced to death in the country. Four Canadians found guilty of drug charges have been sentenced to death since Meng was arrested in December 2018.

Global Affairs Canada repeated past calls for immediate consular access to the two Michaels, who have not been allowed to see Canadian officials since January. The department has accused China of violating international law.

The back and forth follows calls from former Canadian politicians and ambassadors for the federal Liberal government to intervene in the extradition process and free Meng to secure the release of Kovrig and Spavor.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said doing so would encourage more countries to arbitrarily arrest Canadians to put pressure on Ottawa for their own interests.

Meng's legal team recently suffered a defeat in its bid to stop extradition proceedings against their client as a federal court judge rejected their requests for the contents of six confidential documents to be released.

Justice Catherine Kane's Aug. 21 ruling, made public on Tuesday, found the information contained in the documents was not relevant to the allegations of abuse described by Meng's legal team.

Kane added that the attorney general of Canada and a friend of the court submitted a joint proposal that included the lifting of some redactions, but they agreed disclosing the remainder would hurt national security or international relations.

The friend of the court is a lawyer with security clearance who was appointed to view the documents and advise Meng's team on whether any were worthy of dispute, but he was not allowed to share their contents.

Last Friday, the judge presiding over the case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York stayed court proceedings until further notice.

Court records show the judge's order was sealed and access to information about why there was a stay has been restricted.

The sealing order prevents lawyers from commenting on why the case was stayed.

However, before the order was sealed, the court docket said the stay resulted from a government motion and named three federal prosecutors.

It also said the government would be required to inform the court when its proceedings were complete so the stay could be lifted.

The Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York did not respond to a request for comment.

Nygard has denied all allegations and blames a conspiracy caused by a feud with his billionaire neighbour in the Bahamas. He stepped down as chairman of his company after the FBI and police in New York City raided his offices in February.

In court filings last month, Nygard argued the New York court does not have jurisdiction to hear the lawsuit.

The original lawsuit against Nygard, 79, included allegations from 10 women who accused him of enticing them to his estate in the Bahamas. In the following months, more women from Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States have continued to add their names to the lawsuit.

The women, who are not named, share stories in court documents about being brought to Nygard's offices and properties with promises of modelling or other career opportunities. Some allege they were given alcohol spiked with drugs before they were sexually assaulted.

Two women allege they were as young as 14.

The women are asking for a trial by jury and are seeking yet-to-be determined damages.

Two of Nygard's sons filed a separate lawsuit against their father earlier this month claiming they were statutorily raped at his direction when they were teenagers. The sons say Nygard arranged for a woman to have sex with them.

That lawsuit alleges Nygard's sexual predation is an ""open secret"" at Nygard's companies.

The majority of that amount will go to about 1.67 million people in payments of up to $600, which the Liberals say are aimed at offsetting any extra costs linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

The total cost should hit federal books this year, but the budget office warns there may be potential fiscal impacts in subsequent years.

The first legislative push to provide the special payments failed in June when the minority Liberal government couldn't gain opposition support for a wider spending bill.

A few weeks later, a compromise was struck whereby the Liberals expanded eligibility for the payments to also include veterans.

Payments will max out at $600, drop to $300 for any recipients who receive old age security benefits, and fall to $100 for low-income seniors who receive OAS and the guaranteed income supplement.

The report from the budget watchdog Wednesday notes its estimate on the number of people eligible to receive the payments could be thrown off a bit by a separate part of the federal response to the pandemic.

That is because one of the requirements for payments is to be eligible for the disability tax credit, or having applied for the credit by Sept. 25.

The PBO report says the government's extension for filing personal income tax returns could reduce the rate at which people recertify for the credit, but calls it a minor source of uncertainty.

The budget office has been independently tracking federal spending through the pandemic to provide its own analysis over the accuracy of government projections.

It updated one of those projections this week in regarding to a special paid leave for federal employees, known as pay code 699.

The policy gives federal workers paid time off for emergencies such as having to quarantine with COVID-19 or to care for children or other dependants, and doesn't require them to use up vacation or sick days first.

Adding in data from June, the budget office estimates that paid leave has cost the government $828 million since March, inclusive of pension and other benefits. That works out to an average of $3,430 per worker who accessed the leave over that time.

The figures also include estimates for departments that haven't provided data to the budget office.

The report says the number of hours claimed under the policy is ""almost certainly an underestimation of the loss of work hours due to the pandemic.""

Use of the policy has dropped from a peak of 72,700 federal workers in April to just over 43,300 in June, the PBO says. The Canada Revenue Agency continues to have the largest share of workers using the leave.

""The Canada Revenue Agency was able to continue many of its core operations despite claiming by far the most hours of 699 leave. This is due to a strong culture of monitoring time spent on specific activities,"" the budget office wrote on its website.

""It is therefore highly likely that other federal organizations not completing core operating functions like meeting legislated timelines for access-to-information requests are severely under-reporting the extent of hours of work lost due to the pandemic.""

Kim Smythe, chief executive of the Greater Nanaimo Chamber of Commerce, said he has heard that there are a couple of new proponents that may be interested in running a foot-passenger service. He was not given the name of possible ferry operators.

Every election, candidates announce their support for a walk-on service between the cities, seeing it as a desired link for business and individuals. But the idea does not make financial sense to B.C. Ferries.

At B.C. Ferries’ recent annual general meeting, chief executive Mark Collins said the company has “no plans for passenger vessel services.”

Collins, who was responding to a question from a member of the public, said the company operates under the terms of the Coastal Ferry Services contract it has with the province.

“That contract does not specify us to provide such a service,” he said.

“The contract does not prohibit us from going over the contract, of course, and it is possible for the company to introduce new routes.”

B.C. Ferries only brings in new routes when it benefits ferry users, he said.

The current analysis shows that a Nanaimo-Vancouver walk-on route would not be a viable business, Collins said.

“To date, although we have looked at it several times, we see no combination of financial and operational circumstances which would be of benefit to the ferry system,” he said.

“Rather, we see most of these ferry services would be a significant loss-making venture and we do not see that presently as a benefit to ferry users.”

B.C. Ferries is facing a drop in ridership and millions of dollars in lost revenue as a result of the pandemic and has postponed major capital investment.

Two B.C. Ferries routes connect Nanaimo and the Lower Mainland. One runs out of Departure Bay and the other from Duke Point, connecting with Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver and Tsawwassen, respectively. Each offers walk-on and vehicle service.

Tailored Brands, which also owns Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank stores, said over the weekend it will continue to operate most stores during restructuring and expected to reduce its funded debt by $630 million.

COVID-19 restrictions have severely limited weddings and office work since March, hitting the clothing retail and rental sectors particularly hard.

The three Island stores — including Nanaimo’s Brook’s Landing Mall and Westshore Town Centre in Langford — were shut down in March and reopened with reduced staff in late June.

Lawrence Larsen, manager of the Uptown store, said the three Island locations will continue to operate.

At least two stores — both in Surrey — have not reopened.

Larsen said the Uptown location is operating without 40 per cent of its usual staff.

He said sales since reopening have been “consistent, but overall the business is really down” from previous years.

Dinesh Lathi, chief executive of Tailored Brands, said in a statement to clients over the weekend the pandemic has altered the way people live and work.

“It means fewer in-person meetings, wedding celebrations and special events. Simply put, people are staying home more, and our clothes are better suited to being out and about,” Lathi said.

He said the company is “making major shifts” by creating a leaner structure to adapt to the realities of today’s retail environment.

“In July, we announced some store closures. However, we will continue to have stores across Canada operating as usual. Nothing about our decision to seek Chapter 11 protection changes that.”

Meanwhile, Lord & Taylor, the oldest retailer in the U.S., also said it was seeking bankruptcy protection over the weekend, lengthening the list of major retail chains that have faltered during the pandemic.

Household names, many longtime anchors in malls, were already struggling to keep up with consumers moving to online sales.

Lord & Taylor, which began as a Manhattan dry goods store in 1824, was sold to the French rental clothing company Le Tote Inc. last year. Both filed for bankruptcy protection, separately, on Sunday.

Lord & Taylor says it’s looking for a buyer.

Tailored Brands was struggling even before the pandemic lockdowns smothered any demand for suits or ties.

It wasn’t alone.

Last month, Brooks Brothers, the 200-year-old company that dressed nearly every U.S. president, filed for bankruptcy protection. Its rival, Barneys New York, is being dismantled after filing for bankruptcy last year.

Dozens of retailers, big and small, have filed for U.S. Chapter 11 protection this year. The pace through the first half of 2020 far exceeds the number of retail bankruptcies for all of last year. About two dozen U.S.-based chains have sought bankruptcy protection since the pandemic started.

Others include J. Crew, J.C. Penney, Neiman Marcus, Stage Stores, and Ascena Retail Group, which owns Lane Bryant in addition to Ann Taylor.

Loblaw Companies Ltd., which began offering COVID-19 testing for patients at a handful of its Alberta pharmacy locations in June, plans to expand the program to all 234 of its pharmacies in the province by Sept. 1.

article continues below

The company says it has reached out to all 10 provinces to discuss in-store testing outside Alberta, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford this week acknowledging the possibility.

The swab tests are only for those with no symptoms or any known contact with coronavirus patients and may be useful for teachers returning to school or Canadians who take care of an older family member, said Theresa Firestone, head of health and wellness at Shoppers Drug Mart. Loblaw-owned pharmacy locations include Shoppers stores as well as Independent Foods and No Frills.

""It's very convenient. We're in every community. The other plus is they don't have to line up with people who may have symptoms. We've shared that with Ontario and with other provinces, so at this point we’re looking forward to what they may decide,"" Firestone said.

London Drugs also conducts COVID-19 tests in Alberta. It began offering the service at six locations during the past two weeks and plans to roll it out at nine more by October. Like Shoppers, it bills Alberta Health Services for testing costs.

The service builds on other responses to the pandemic such as online pharmacist consultations and a pilot program where patients consult virtually with doctors in a private room in the store.

London Drugs is among the pharmacy retailers beefing up their role in a health-care system grappling with an aging population.

""With the extended hours of operation, you can basically go in when our stores are open and be able to find a pharmacist to ask a question. So what we’re able to do at that point is basically help triage the system,"" said Chris Chiew, head of pharmacy at the Richmond, B.C.-based retailer.

London Drugs has also hired diabetes educators to test blood sugar levels and assist patients with weight management and diet.

Shoppers has stepped even further into the realm of physicians, opening one of three planned medical clinics with doctors who cater to a roster of patients and walk-in services.

""There are a number of Canadians who don’t have access to a family physician. And we thought there was an opportunity for us to really play a role here in terms of access,"" Firestone said.

Drugstores can also handle the bureaucratic side of health care, freeing up doctors to spend more time with patients, she said.

""Looking for PPE (personal protective equipment), sorting out their waiting rooms so that people are socially distanced, managing virtual care...we’re able to take that burden on for them,"" Firestone said.

In 2018, Shoppers launched its Wellwise store chain to sell assisted-living devices aimed at older Canadians. More recently, it began to offer tips and videos online designed to help ward off depression and anxiety.

Metro Inc. declined to comment on any attempts to provide COVID-19 testing. The bulk of the company's Jean Coutu drugstores are located in Quebec, which unlike some provinces does not allow pharmacists to conduct testing via nose and mouth swabs.

In a statement, one unnamed Starbucks worker, said the staff were sick of “being paid minimum wage to work for a multibillion-dollar company, being understaffed during a global pandemic, and we don’t like decisions that directly affect our safety being made without us.”

Steve Hunt, the Western Canada director of the Steelworkers, said the staff started organizing electronically about one month ago, driven by concerns raised about health and safety during the pandemic.

“Everyone is concerned about their health and there were some issues here,” he said.

“It’s an interesting thing — we can’t organize if people are treated with dignity and respect. There are obviously some problems and we, hopefully, can work with the employer.”

In a statement, Starbucks said it prides itself on open and direct communication with its staff.

“And while we are disappointed with this result and respect the free choice of our partners to affiliate with unions, we believe a direct relationship with partners is the best way to create and maintain a great work environment,” the company said.

Hunt said Starbucks is not a typical marriage for the union, given the Steelworkers represent 50,000 workers in Western Canada, many of them forest workers, but the union has made itself available during the pandemic based on demand.

“We are getting calls from all over right now because of COVID-19,” he said, adding hospitality industry workers have a tough job being on the frontline during a pandemic.

Hunt said organizing a Starbucks staff is not normally what the union would do, but it has developed a position through the pandemic that essential workers doesn’t mean sacrificial.

“They needed a union and we are happy to represent them,” he said.

Hunt said the coffee shop’s staff likely sought the Steelworkers out because the union is known for its backbone.

“They probably looked around and we are well known,” he said. “We don’t go looking for a fight, but we don’t back down either. I think it was as simple as that.”

“Workers from all sectors are reaching out to unions for safety, decent wages and a voice in their workplaces, especially during the pandemic,” said Hunt.

“Workers are told they are essential, but they don’t have the wages or safety protections that should back that claim up.”

Hunt said the next step is to establish a bargaining committee among the workers, get some members active in the union and offer training, then contact the company about bargaining sessions.

“We’re really excited about it,” said Murphy. “The Peninsula is growing, younger families are coming out here and the key thing is our farm is out there as are many of our suppliers and growers, so we’re delighted to be out there and closer to them.”

He also noted they love the location. “We like the Pier Hotel to start with. It is a great property and that is a stunning piece of waterfront It’s a great spot and to be part of the hotel we think it’s an outstanding fit for us to be able to join them.”

The 140-seat dining room will be closed for just over two months as it undergoes renovations to the dining room and modifications to the kitchen.

Murphy said they intend to warm up the room by using more wood decor and adding fireplaces. There are also plans for a large bar that will include an oyster shucking ceviche stations.

Murphy said the 30 staff that will be affected by the closure will likely be offered positions with the new restaurant, and may not be off work for long.

He said between the farm, which will be planting a large orchard in February, construction at the new restaurant and his two downtown restaurants, there will be a spot for them.

Five Victoria entrepreneurs say despite the pandemic, there’s no time like the present to open a new store dedicated to the delectable treat.

“In times of recession, people always buy what they like,” partner David Booth said.

He and his wife, Vlasta, have been making TerribleTruffles for more than a decade. They have joined David Mincey, of The Chocolate Project, and Heidi Lalonde and Stephanie Sketchley, of Uncouth Chocolate, in a new retail operation in downtown Victoria.

Chocolat & Co., which opened Saturday at 703 Fort St., is a collective of the vanguard of chocolate producers in Victoria who are sourcing cacao beans from around the world and “obsessing” with roasting, refining and creating chocolate treats and drinks.

“We live and breathe chocolate, all of us,” Booth said. “It’s our passion.”

Mincey, who operated Camille’s restaurant in Bastion Square for years, has been sourcing cacao beans for two decades from farmers in Peru, Papua New Guinea and Madagascar, rather than large industrial wholesalers in Europe.

He created The Chocolate Project to trace the source of cacao beans, right down to the farm and type of tree.

Mincey is now considered one of Canada’s leading experts on chocolate, lecturing on the bean-to-bar process across North America and leading a course at the University of Victoria.

The Chocolate Project, which opened in The Public Market in the Hudson building in 2014, has created more than 350 different bars of chocolate from 60 artisan makers and inspired a new wave in the foodie movement, including Lalonde and Sketchley who launched their business after working with Mincey.

Mincey said Victoria is now considered the chocolate mecca in Canada and one of the leading producers of artisan chocolates in North America.

“I can tell you we definitely have a rabid fan base for chocolate in this town,” Mincey said. “People not only love chocolate, but they love to know where it comes from. We’ve created a library and tasting it is like a journey to an exotic country.”

Mincey said the new venture on Fort Street brings together “a cool mix of different talents.”

David Booth earned his Red Seal certification in pastries in 1992, and began making chocolate truffles at a family-run bed and breakfast. In 2016, the Booths bought the Birdcage Confectionery in James Bay, where a corner is stocked with their Terrible Truffles-branded chocolates.

“Opening a store that is dedicated to chocolate is a dream come true. I’ve always pictured myself with a chocolate shop and a lineup out the door,” he said.

Lalonde and Sketchley have been making bean-to-bar chocolate for the past six years.

The new store will be a permanent home for the pair, who have been selling at farmer’s markets and craft fairs.

Sketchley, a former archeologist and sustainability co-ordinator with Mountain Equipment Co-op, said customers can expect everything from single-origin chocolate bars and baking to truffles, bon bons with fruit and creme and caramel fillings, and hot and cold chocolate drinks.

Chocolat & Co.’s location, near the Royal Bank at the corner of Douglas and Fort streets, has been home to a chocolate shop for nearly 15 years. The Pappas family ran a store there and sold it last September, but the new owners shuttered the store as the pandemic hit.

Mincey said consumers seem very willing to support small businesses. He said sales at The Chocolate Project dipped considerably early in the pandemic, but have since climbed to levels before the virus hit.

Jeff Bray, executive director of the Downtown Victoria Business Association, said it’s encouraging to see Chocolat & Co. open a new venture during a difficult economic times.

“I think it’s a reminder that we should support local businesses,” Bray said.

He said although some stores and restaurants are showing improvements in sales and traffic, it isn’t near the levels needed to keep everybody afloat.

Bray said with the U.S. border closed and tourism at all-time lows, the key for survival for most downtown businesses right now is the return of government workers and others to offices.

“Come September, we need office workers back or more people to make purposeful decision to shop downtown. If not, there will be significant business closures.”

The Canadian Association of Broadcasters issued a report on Wednesday warning of potential closures and widespread job cuts as private TV and radio broadcasters face a cumulative projected revenue shortfall of up to $1.06 billion by the end of 2022.

Most vulnerable are the country's AM radio stations, the report said, as well as other independent private radio and TV operations in smaller markets across the country.

The study, titled ""The Crisis in Canadian Media and the Future of Local Broadcasting,"" was commissioned by the CAB, which represents the majority of private broadcasters in Canada, and conducted through Winnipeg-based independent media economics consultancy Communications Management Inc.

The CAB says it's concerned about the fallout from a substantial erosion in local advertising revenues over recent months.

Radio stations may be hardest hit in the short term, the report suggests, partly due to many advertisers pulling back on their spending in the pandemic and hastening a decline in the media industry's revenues.

Private radio ad revenues are expected to be $383 million below last year, it said.

The report's projections suggest that without further government support those declines could mean as many as 50 private local radio stations go out of business over the next four to six months.

Another 150 radio stations could topple in the 18 months that follow, it said, leading to as many as 2,000 job losses.

TV stations could risk a similar fate with roughly 40 of Canada's 94 private TV broadcasters in danger of closing within one to three years, the research predicts.

The CAB is calling on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to take swift action by establishing a ""more fair and sustainable future"" for local media.

Last month, the organization sent an emergency application to the CRTC requesting permission for broadcasters to be relieved of certain terms of their agreements, such as spending requirements on Canadian programming, for the broadcast year that ends Aug. 31.

Lenore Gibson, chair of the CAB, said broadcasters have ""done their utmost to cut expenses"" in areas such as administration, and ""the last thing that they want to do is cut into programming costs, but that's the only area that's left now.""

The CAB is urging the federal government to provide emergency regulatory relief as well as greater ""targeted support"" for the industry starting this fall.

Without greater financial measures in place, the CAB says the effects could leave many communities with only national and international media organizations to provide them with most of their news, effectively eliminating most community coverage of local politics, health and education in some regions of the country.

Almost normal being the operative phrase. It wasn’t exactly like when future MLBers and former B.C. Premier Baseball League players Nick Pivetta of the Eagles, Rich Harden, Michael Saunders of the Mariners, James Paxton, Tyler O’Neill, Larry Walker, Ryan Dempster, Jeff Francis, Brett Lawrie, Adam Loewen and Justin Morneau played.

These Mariners and Eagles players were not in the dugouts like the old days but more widely spaced outside them. Parents and grand-parents were not allowed in the stands but were socially distanced in family pods around the field on lawn chairs. A new ball had to be brought in every time after the previous one was put into play.

But the players were on the diamond playing the game they love, and had been deprived of, and that’s all that mattered as Phase 3 of the B.C. return to sport has begun.

The third phase allows for games between associations on a regional basis. The annual Zack Downey Memorial Tournament between the Mariners, Eagles and fellow-BCPBL teams Parksville Royals and Mid-Island Pirates of Nanaimo is scheduled for Layritz Park from Sept. 18 to 21.

“I know athletes and their families have been missing the joy of competition these past few months,” Lisa Beare, provincial minister of tourism, arts and culture and minister responsible for sports, said in a statement Monday.

Phase 3 also opens the gate for the Island Cup preseason B.C. Hockey League tournament featuring the Victoria Grizzlies, Cowichan Valley Capitals, Nanaimo Clippers, Alberni Valley Bulldogs and Powell River Kings beginning Oct. 2 and ahead of the BCHL’s anticipated season opening Dec. 1. Similar respective regional or “cohort” BCHL exhibition tournaments are planned for the Lower Mainland and also Interior teams.

“It’s exciting to know we will be having preseason games through the fall in what will be an extended training camp,” said Grizzlies GM and head coach Craig Didmon, in welcoming the announcement of Phase 3.

“It’s important for player development.”

But Phase 3 is no consolation for the Western Lacrosse Association’s Victoria Shamrocks and Nanaimo Timbermen, West Coast League baseball’s Victoria HarbourCats or B.C. junior football’s Westshore Rebels and V.I. Raiders, whose 2020 seasons were cancelled due to COVID19. The Victoria Royals lost the 2020 Western Hockey League playoffs but at least have a tentative 2020-21 season start date of Dec. 4 and the numerous Island-based Olympians have Tokyo 2020 plus one next summer.

There are still pandemic guidelines to be followed as sport opens wider in Phase 3.

“And everyone is taking them seriously,” said Mike Chewpoy, head coach of baseball’s Victoria Mariners of the BCPBL.

“Nobody wants to take the chance of being shut down again because they didn’t follow the rules. It’s not hard, just different. We normally go through a dozen and a half balls in doubleheaders. Now we go through four dozen balls. But the guys are just happy to be out there playing after having baseball taken away from them for most of the season.”

The B.C. Centre for Disease Control has reviewed viaSport’s return to sport guidelines for Phase 3. ViaSport is a not-for-profit organization, created with the support of the provincial government in 2011, to help guide and build sport in the province. Its Phase 3 protocols address regional cohort teams and competitions, travel, high-performance training for the likes of the Olympians based in Victoria, Richmond and Whistler, and run-of-game aspects such as physical contact.

“These guidelines will enable the social and emotional benefits of sport while ensuring the sports activities remain as safe as possible,” said B.C. health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry.

Phase 3 is considered the lynchpin stage to eventual return to normal play, whenever that will be, and has been long awaited throughout this summer by those in sports.

“Now, as we enter Phase 3, we will start to see more sport activities in communities around the province,” said Charlene Krepiakevich, CEO of viaSport.

“While these guidelines offer key parameters for the increase in sport activity, each sport will advance at a different pace depending on community capacity and readiness.”

There are 72 funded sports organizations in B.C. with 4,100 local sport organizations with more than 800,000 participants from youth to masters. To date, according to viaSport, 60 organizations have completed their return to play plans.

B.C. Soccer, for instance, announced throw-ins will be replaced by kick-ins from the sidelines in order to limit hand-to-ball contact.

Bo Horvat scored twice, and Tyler Toffoli and Elias Pettersson each had a goal and two assists as the Canucks defeated the Golden Knights 5-2 at Rogers Place.

The best-of-seven second-round series is tied 1-1. Game 3 goes Thursday.

Forty-eight hours earlier, the Golden Knights, now 8-2 in the post-season, had manhandled the Canucks en route to a 5-0 pounding in Game 1.

""For us as a team we wanted to bounce back from Game 1. We weren't happy with that,"" said Pettersson.

""We played a good game. We should be happy about it but (we need) a short-term memory and be ready for Game 3.""

Goaltender Jacob Markstrom made 38 saves for the win while Robin Lehner stopped 22 shots for Vegas. It's the first time Vegas has allowed more than five goals in a game in the return-to-play tournament.

It was the first game back for Toffoli since the opening game of the qualifying round against the Minnesota Wild on Aug. 2. The NHL is not releasing information on injuries, but Toffoli had been seen in a walking boot.

Toffoli jumped over the boards for his first shift in the first period and scored nine seconds later, taking a cross-crease pass from Pettersson to put the puck into a yawning net. He then made it 2-0 on the power play, delivering a tape-to-tape pass to an incoming Horvat, who blasted it past Lehner.

""It's fun to get back in the lineup and get a big win and tie this series up,"" said Toffoli, who had been acquired at the trade deadline from the Los Angeles Kings. He had put up 10 points in his first 10 games with the Canucks before the regular season ended March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I made some phone calls yesterday, talked to a lot of people. It was a busy day,"" said Toffoli. ""It was good obviously getting the OK from everybody (to play). I got all excited. Felt like I was coming back to my first playoff series.""

Vancouver coach Travis Green said the 5-0 loss was their worst game of the playoffs and that Game 2 was a must-win.

""You go down two (games) against that team early in the series it would be tough and just mentally, too (to come back),"" he said.

""We were better with the puck, played a more direct game. I thought we were better on our feet, quicker. That's a good hockey team. I thought we did a good job of making them defend more than we did the first game.""

Despite being down by two goals in the second period, the Golden Knights looked like they were going to run the Canucks out of the rink again.

Markstrom kept the Canucks alive as Vegas tilted the ice and turned his net into a shooting gallery, blasting away for 22 shots in the period. Vegas got one goal back from Alex Tuch before Pettersson scored on a cross-ice feed from Alex Edler to make it 3-1 heading into the third.

""That really was a back-breaker,"" said Vegas head coach Peter DeBoer. ""You're down 3-1 and you have nothing to show for the work you put in to try and get back in the game.""

Tuch added: ""We knew Vancouver wasn't happy with the way they played last game and we knew they were going to come out flying. And we decided instead of being prepared, (to) be surprised by that for some reason.""

Vancouver iced the game 18 seconds into the third on Horvat's second goal. Then the frustration finally got to Vegas.

First, Max Pacioretty grabbed J.T. Miller by the head and threw him down after the whistle for a roughing penalty. Tuch got a double minor for pummelling Jake Virtanen while the Vancouver forward lay on the ice.

Pacioretty scored late for Vegas and Tanner Pearson added the final Vancouver goal into an empty net.

Horvat had not found the scoresheet since scoring two goals in each of the first two games against the St. Louis Blues in the first round.

Pettersson has been a steady point-getter throughout the playoffs but had been shut down by Vegas in Game 1, limited to no shots on net and one blocked shot.

Markstrom, in his first playoff series, has been the locomotive pulling the Canucks' playoff train. He allowed just nine goals on 121 shots (.926 save percentage) against Minnesota in the first round while registering his first playoff shutout. He saved 29 of 34 against the Blues (.930).

The series is being played at a fan-less Rogers Place. Players are isolating between contests to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This was Williams’ fifth match since professional tennis resumed amid the coronavirus pandemic after a hiatus of nearly six months — and all five have gone three sets. She is 3-2 in that stretch.

The result against No. 13 seed Sakkari, and particularly the way the match ended, was hardly promising for Williams as the U.S. Open’s start approaches next week.

The Western & Southern Open is usually held in Ohio but was moved to the U.S. Open’s site in Flushing Meadows this year to make for a two-event, no-spectator ""bubble"" during the pandemic.

In men's play, Canada's Milos Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Andy Murray. Raonic, from Thornhill, Ont., is the last Canadian remaining in the draw.

Williams was seemingly in control early, serving for the first set at 5-3, 30-0, when things began to unravel. She missed two backhands in a row, then put a forehand into the net to set up a break point, and walked over to the stand holding her towel at the back of the court (the ball people normally handle towels for players, but not during COVID-19).

That’s when chair umpire Aurelie Tourte called a time violation. On the following point, Williams sailed a forehand long to get broken.

At the ensuing changeover, the 23-time Grand Slam champion argued with Tourte, saying: ""I mean, I’m getting my own towels. That’s not fair. You should tell me on the sidelines next time if I need to play faster. Believe me, I will. ... You didn't even give me a warning.""

While Williams eventually did grab that set, she again frittered away a 5-3 lead in the second, plus a 4-1 edge in the tiebreaker. When she sat after the second set, the 38-year-old American tossed her racket over her shoulder the way an office worker might flip a crumpled piece of paper toward a trash can.

Williams came out flat in the third set, as if she’d rather be anywhere else. She double-faulted four times in the second game, including on Sakkari’s eighth break chance, to make it 2-0 and that was pretty much that.

Hours earlier, Novak Djokovic’s neck felt much better, and his tennis looked much better, in a 6-2, 6-4 victory over unseeded American Tennys Sandgren that improved the No. 1-ranked man to 20-0 in 2020.

""Actually, I’m pleasantly surprised with the way I recovered and felt today — just overall, physically, but also with the neck, specifically, because that was a little bit of a concern,"" said Djokovic, who will be eyeing his 18th Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open. ""Going back four, five days, I did struggle quite a lot.""

Djokovic was treated by a trainer and played sluggishly in his opening match Monday, but he was at his best from the outset against Sandgren and saved all four break points he faced.

Djokovic will face 34th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff in the quarterfinals. The other quarterfinal in the top half of the draw will be defending champion Daniil Medvedev against No. 8 seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Reilly Opelka, a 6-foot-11 American who is ranked 39th, delivered 19 aces and knocked off 2019 U.S. Open semifinalist Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 7-6 (4). Opelka next meets No. 4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, whose 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4) win over No. 16 John Isner was interrupted by a rain delay of nearly 1 1/2 hours late in the first set.

Also interrupted by the weather was Raonic's victory over the three-time Grand Slam champion. Raonic, a Wimbledon runner-up in 2016, has held all 29 games he’s served so far in the tournament.

""I have done the work,"" Raonic said. ""I have put in the effort, and I'm just happy that this quickly the pieces are coming together.""

This was Murray's first tournament appearance since November. He missed time due to a pelvic injury and is playing on a metal hip after two operations on that joint.

""Didn’t play well. It was not a good day,"" Murray said. ""The positives are that I got three matches in. Physically, I pulled up OK.""

Women’s quarterfinal matchups set earlier in the day were two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka against Anett Kontaveit, former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka against Ons Jabeur, and 83rd-ranked American qualifier Jessica Pegula against No. 14 Elise Mertens.

Hawerchuk and Corrigan were linemates, along with Marc Crawford, when the Cornwall Royals won the Memorial Cup Canadian major-junior championship in 1979-80. That ring is a cherished keepsake for Corrigan, the former CEO of B.C. Ferries. So are his recollections of the Hockey Hall of Famer Hawerchuk, who died last week at 57.

“He was such a nice and humble guy and remained that way his entire life,” said Corrigan.

“He always talked about other people first – about how important I was to the line – never about himself. He was that type of person.”

Winning a championship in any sport is a bond that remains with those players who went through the experience together.

“We were all just kids, but it sticks with you forever,” said Corrigan.

“Dale was 16 and Marc and I were both 18 the season we won the Memorial Cup. Dale was a skinny-legged kid and Marc and I made sure nobody bothered him. But Dale was impossible to hit, regardless.”

Hawerchuk led Cornwall to a second consecutive Memorial Cup title in 1980-81. The Victoria Cougars were the Western Hockey League representatives that year in the Memorial Cup but were unable to stop Hawerchuk, even with the likes of Grant Fuhr, Barry Pederson, Torrie Robertson, Mark Morrison, Paul Cyr, Rich Chernomaz, Geoff Courtnall, Bob McGill and Tony Feltrin in the Victoria line-up.

Corrigan had been traded and played for the Sudbury Wolves that season, so missed out on the Memorial Cup double with Hawerchuk and Crawford.

Corrigan was selected in the fifth round of the 1980 NHL draft, 88th overall by the Detroit Red Wings, and drifted around for three seasons in the minor-pro system with the Adirondack Red Wings and Kalamazoo Wings before bigger things as an executive away from hockey.

Crawford went on to coach, including Colorado to the Stanley Cup, in Vancouver with the Canucks, and Canada at the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics.

“That line all had success in life in different ways,” noted Corrigan, who formerly coached the Victoria Breakers girls’ teams, and is still involved in the international ferry business.

“I ran B.C. Ferries, but people are far more intrigued if I tell them about my hockey career and the guys I played with, because that is the unique interest people have in sports,” said Corrigan.

He can proudly say he played with one of the best, with the ring to prove it.

He was 5 under after the front nine Tuesday at Ozarks National when he hit driver at the par-4 10th. The ball wound up in such heavy rough that Mickelson couldn't find it, forcing him to take a penalty stroke. He still wound up making a long putt to salvage bogey, and that gave him some momentum for the rest of the round.

""I was able to get right back to even par on the back side with a birdie on the next hole, and then I made a couple more coming in,"" said Mickelson, whose 7-under 64 left him 17 under.

That was good for a four-shot lead over Tim Petrovic and Rod Pampling, who will be his playing partners for the final round. Mike Weir of Bright's Grove, Ont., (69) was nine shots off the lead at 8 under.

""I've been putting really well,"" Mickelson said. ""Today I didn't drive it the way I've been driving it. I kind of a hung a few drives, so I'm going to the range and try to work on that now. But when I come out tomorrow I'll try to be a little bit more aggressive with the driver and see if I can make a few more birdies.""

A few more? He's already made 19 of them in his first 36 holes.

Playing in the final group and with the shadows getting long, Mickelson picked up right where he left off after his opening-round 61. He made birdie at the third and then rattled off three straight beginning at the par-4 fifth, where he nearly chipped in for eagle.

Petrovic tried to make a run at Mickelson, but even one of his career-low rounds only got him so close. His putter went cold down the stretch and a poor approach at the par-4 finishing hole resulted in bogey.

Mickelson added a bridie at the ninth, the only hole he bogeyed on Monday, after a pretty flop shot over the bunker. After the lost ball at the 10th, Mickelson responded by adding two more birdies.

The second of them at the par-3 12th was a backhanded tap-in. His approach shot barely carried onto the front edge of the green, then nestled up to about an inch from the hole.

Mickelson could still squander the lead in the final round Wednesday, when tee times were moved to the early morning because of expected bad weather in the afternoon. But given the quality of his short game through 36 holes, the more pressing question is whether he could break the PGA Tour Champions' 54-hole scoring record of 191 — shared by Bruce Fleisher, Loren Roberts, Bernhard Langer, David Frost and Rocco Mediate.

Mickelson, who decided to make his debut on the over-50 tour to continue his U.S. Open prep after he was eliminated from the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, would need to shoot 65 in his final round Wednesday to move atop the list.

Petrovic and Pampling each shot 64-65 over the first two rounds. Rocco Mediate struggled coming in and was at 12 under.

K.J. Choi was another shot back, and Steve Stricker and David McKenzie were at 10 under.

Moments later, the Chicago White Sox right-hander threw the final pitch in a truly bizarre performance.

article continues below

A no-fan no-no.

With the seats at Guaranteed Rate Field empty, Giolito pitched the first no-hitter of the pandemic-delayed season, striking out 13 in leading the White Sox over the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 Tuesday night.

""2020 has been a very strange year,"" said Giolito, who conducted a postgame interview while wearing a mask. ""Obviously a lot of weird stuff going on with COVID and the state of the world, so may as well throw this in the mix.""

Sounds like he didn't mind that nobody saw it. Well, almost no one.

After right fielder Adam Engel extended on the run to catch Erik Gonzalez’s slicing drive toward the line for the final out, the hollers of Giolito’s teammates in the middle of the diamond echoed around the stadium.

""I’m just stoked for Lucas and so happy and ecstatic and emotional for Lucas,"" Engel said. ""It stinks we couldn’t celebrate the way most no-hitters get celebrated.""

The smallest crowd listed for any no-hitter in the majors over the last 100 years came in 1944, when a mere 1,014 watched Cincinnati’s Clyde Shoun beat the Braves at Crosley Field.

Nowhere close to that number on this night, not with the park that holds over 40,000 closed to fans because of virus protocols.

Suffice to say, years from now when White Sox fans fondly remember Giolito’s gem, there will not be, say, 100,000 or so people claiming they were there to see it in person.

At one point early in the game, some members of grounds crew drifted in sight, but that was about it outside of the teams.

An All-Star last year, the 26-year-old Giolito (3-2) matched his career high for strikeouts set in his previous start against Detroit.

Only a four-pitch walk to Gonzalez leading off the fourth inning got in Giolito’s way of perfection. That was only runner he permitted while throwing 101 pitches

""I’ve been working for this type of game for a while now and it’s really cool that we got it done,"" Giolito said.

Giolito relied on his changeup and fastball to make quick work of the Pirates, who came into the game batting just .229 and have the worst record in the majors. Six of their starters finished the game hitting under .199 this season.

The White Sox rushed toward the mound after the final out in Giolito’s first career no-hitter. Giolito hugged catcher James McCann as the Chicago players joined the party.

The South Side of Chicago normally rattles with fireworks after a home win -- this is the club that gave the game the exploding scoreboard -- but the park remained silent as the dugout emptied.

Giolito, meanwhile, was locked in his own zone in the later innings, fully aware of what was at stake.

""After the seventh, six more outs, looking at who I was facing, became very, very, very possible,"" he said, ""and then we were able to get it done.""

Giolito said his approach never wavered.

""Just staying with the same, like, mental routine for every single pitch. One pitch at a time. Full focus, full execution, straight through the target,"" he said.

Giolito pitched the 19th no-hitter in White Sox history — second most to the Dodgers' 23 — and first since Philip Humber threw a perfect game at Seattle in 2012. This was the seventh time the Pirates have been held hitless, with Washington’s Max Scherzer having done it in 2015.

White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson made a nifty play on a grounder by Bryan Reynolds up the middle in the seventh to preserve the gem, helped by first baseman Jose Abreu’s stretch at the bag.

In the ninth, Gonzalez hit a liner that Engel, a fleet centre fielder for most of his career, caught on the run at knee-high height.

""Yeah man, I think I got it,"" Gonzalez said. ""With that at-bat, I was a little bit mad because I don’t want to be part of history.""

Giolito improved to 30-28 in his big league career. He made his debut with Washington in 2016, then was traded after that season to the White Sox in a package for outfielder Adam Eaton.

Giolito gave up a major league-high 118 earned runs in 2018, his first full season in Chicago.

""I was pretty much bottom of the league in almost every stat,"" Giolito said. ""I kind of had to ... learn from failure to learn my true potential.""

He added: ""I always envisioned that I’d throw a no-hitter in the big leagues.""

Giolito threw the first no-hitter at Guaranteed Rate Field since Minnesota’s Francisco Liriano did it in 2011.

The White Sox, who’ve won eight of their last nine, ended the Pirates’ season-best winning streak at three games.

Giolito was dominant in his previous start, too, fanning 13 against Detroit and allowing just three hits in seven innings. The victory over Pittsburgh was his third career shutout.

His team gave up a goal he felt shouldn't have counted three minutes into the opening period and had a subsequent equalizer called back on a razor-thin offside challenge.

Down 1-0 in the series and playing well, Tampa Bay then grabbed its first lead in more than 110 minutes of action midway through the third period only to see Boston tie it up with under four minutes to go in regulation.

""Adversity strikes in the weirdest ways,"" Cooper said. ""You never know when it's going to happen.

""Sometimes you're just dealt ... a sandwich that doesn't taste very good, if you know what I mean.""

And deal with it they did.

Ondrej Palat scored at 4:40 of overtime as the Lightning defeated the Bruins 4-3 to even their second-round playoff series 1-1.

Blake Coleman added two goals in regulation for the Lightning, while Nikita Kucherov had the other. Andrei Vasilevskiy made 22 saves to get the win.

""If there was one message that was going on it was we liked everything that was going on about the game,"" Cooper said. ""I know it sounds so cliche, but we just had to stick with it. Some teams, if you have mental weakness at all, you're probably sitting there saying, 'Poor us.'

""But it's just not been this group. That's not how they operate.""

Brad Marchand buried his second of the night to tie things with under four minutes left in the third period for the Bruins, while Nick Ritchie also scored. David Pastrnak added two assists for Boston, which got 36 stops from Jaroslav Halak.

The teams don't have much time to digest the result, with Game 3 of the best-of-seven matchup set for Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET back inside the fan-less Scotiabank Arena.

Tampa, which beat the Columbus Blue Jackets in quintuple overtime of Game 1 in the opening round before closing out the series in the extra period of Game 5 on a pair of goals from Brayden Point, got the winner after Boston couldn't clear its zone.

Patrick Maroon tried a wraparound that Halak stopped, but Palat was there to bury the rebound to score his first of the post-season and send the Lightning pouring off their bench in celebration.

""It's obviously big-time frustrating any time you lose a game and especially in that fashion,"" Bruins centre Sean Kuraly said. ""We thought we were trending in the right direction, (thinking) momentum may be swinging our way. You get the puck close to the blue line a couple times and you don't get it out, and against a good team that's what happens.

""It ends up in the back of your net.""

Acquired prior to February's trade deadline from the New Jersey Devils, Coleman gave Tampa its first lead of the series at 10:40 of the third after taking a stretch pass from Victor Hedman. The Lightning centre moved in alone on Halak and snuck an off-speed shot through the five-hole after getting slashed by Bruins defenceman Connor Clifton.

Boston, however, responded with 3:58 left in regulation when Marchand finished off a pretty passing play. With the Bruins in the middle of a change — Patrice Bergeron would normally be on the ice — Kuraly took a feed from Pastrnak and quickly found Marchand to bury his sixth and knot things up.

The Bruins, who triumphed 3-2 in Game 1 on the back of Halak's 35-save performance, took a 2-1 lead with 5:27 left in the second on a power play when Pastrnak faked a one-timer before sliding a pass to Marchand at the side of the net.

Tampa responded 56 seconds later after some great work from Point. The diminutive centre twisted and turned in the Bruins zone before finding Kevin Shattenkirk, whose shot was tipped in by Kucherov for his third.

The Lightning dressed seven defencemen with Ryan McDonagh (undisclosed), who has averaged a team-high 26:07 of ice time in the post-season, out injured after leaving midway through the third period of Game 1. Veteran blue-liners Luke Schenn and Braydon Coburn drew in, while Carter Verhaeghe was scratched up front.

Boston owned the best record in the NHL when the league suspended its season because of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, but dropped to the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference after losing all three of its games in the round-robin portion of the restart.

The Bruins found their groove in the first round of the usual 16-team playoff bracket, disposing of the Carolina Hurricanes in five games.

Tampa, meanwhile, had the second-best mark in the East and was fourth overall when the schedule was halted. The Lightning finished second in the round-robin and then downed Columbus.

The Bruins jumped out to a 1-0 lead at 3:14 of Tuesday's first period after Tampa defenceman Zach Bogosian's stick disintegrated at the offensive blue line. Boston broke the other way, with Ritchie stuffing his first past Vasilevskiy, who thought he had the puck covered — much to Cooper's chagrin.

The Lightning responded a couple minutes later when Barclay Goodrow tipped Coburn's point shot up and over Halak. The Bruins, however, correctly challenged for offside after Point was a fraction of a second too slow exiting the Boston zone on the tag up.

Cooper fired a number of expletives at the officials when the call was reversed, but was back smiling on the bench after a surprising burst from an unlikely source eventually knotted the score.

Bogosian, a bruising blue-liner known mostly for his physical play, split two Boston defenders, and as he was getting knocked down fed a diving Coleman, who slid his second past Halak before crashing into the net at 12:42.

""I saw Bogo picking up some speed,"" Coleman said. ""He just kind of had that look in his eye like he was about to do something. I just made it a point to get up into play with him, try to give him an option.

""He made a heck of a play.""

It was also the first sign the Lightning weren't going to be fazed by that early adversity.

""Any time there's a mishap, you just turn the page,"" Cooper said of his roster. ""It was needed tonight, I'll tell you that, because they need to be rewarded for the work they were doing.

""And in the end, they were.""

The All-Star guard scored 35 points and the Los Angeles Clippers rolled past the Dallas Mavericks 154-111 on Tuesday night to take a 3-2 lead in their first-round Western Conference playoff series.

George had shot 29% in the series and endured fans' wrath on social media. He said he spoke to the team psychiatrist before Game 5.

""I mean, whatever it was, the bubble got the best of me,"" George said. ""I was just in a dark place. I really wasn’t here. I checked out. The past couple of games, it was just difficult.""

George said it didn't feel like the playoffs until his teammates decided to create the atmosphere that was lacking inside the NBA's Walt Disney World bubble.

""I came in with that mindset that this is Staples, we’re at home,"" he said. ""The place is packed. I really had to psych myself up. I thought the whole team took that and we ran with it. We created our own energy. We decided to dictate this game.""

Kawhi Leonard scored 32 points and Montrezl Harrell added 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers, who set a franchise record for points in a playoff game. Los Angeles can clinch the series on Thursday.

Dallas' Luka Doncic, who hit a game-winner at the buzzer in Game 4 to cap off a 43-point triple-double, was held to 22 points on 6-for-17 shooting.

Dallas coach Rick Carlisle was ejected in the third quarter of the testy game, which included six technicals and a flagrant-1 foul.

Doncic said Clippers forward Marcus Morris might have stepped on his ankle intentionally early in the third quarter.

""I don’t want to talk to him,"" Doncic said. ""He’s just saying a lot of bad stuff to me all the game. I don’t want to talk to him. I’ve just got to move on. Like I said, everybody’s going to have their own opinion. I just hope it wasn’t intentional. If that was intentional, that’s very bad.""

Mavericks centre Kristaps Porzingis sat out with right knee soreness. It was the second straight game the 7-foot-3 Latvian missed.

Leonard scored 22 points and Paul George scored 18 to help Los Angeles take a 76-52 lead at halftime. The Clippers shot 61% in the first half and led by as many as 27 points.

The Clippers continued the onslaught in the second half, bumping the lead to as many as 45 points.

""Tough game,"" Carlisle said. ""Very poor performance by us. It was disappointing. It was very physical. We just need to have a stronger physical disposition to start the game and throughout. We’ve got to get some more traction at both ends of the floor.""

Mavericks: Doncic was issued a technical foul in the second quarter. ... G Tim Hardaway Jr. was called for a flagrant-1 after winding up and hitting George in the face on a drive. ... Assistant Stephen Silas took over as coach after Carlisle was ejected.

Clippers: Shot 67% from the field in the first quarter. ... Hardaway and Morris were called for double technicals in the second quarter. C Ivica Zubac was called for a technical in the third.

BIGGER THAN BASKETBALL

Clippers coach Doc Rivers was emotional while discussing the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which has sparked national outrage and some violent protests. Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back while his three children watched.

""That video, if you watch that video — you don’t need to be Black to be outraged,"" Rivers said. ""You need to be American and outraged. How dare the Republicans talk about fear. We’re the ones that need to be scared. We’re the ones having to talk to every Black child. What white father has to give his son a talk about being careful if you get pulled over? It’s just ridiculous. It keeps going. There’s no charges. Breonna Taylor — no charges. Nothing. All we’re asking is you live up to the Constitution. That’s all we’re asking -- for everybody. For everyone.""

CARLISLE'S EJECTION

Carlisle described what led to his ejection. Hardaway had the ball at the free-throw line, and then Rivers was granted a timeout.

""My understanding in that situation is that once a shooter has the ball, a timeout cannot be called by the opposing coach,"" Carlisle said. ""I thought the call was wrong. So I was asking about it and wasn’t getting a great explanation and then it turned into a technical and then another technical. I’m just standing up for my team.""

In fact, The Escoffier Cookbook: And Guide to the Fine Art of Cookery for Connoisseurs, Chefs, ­Epicures, offers 12 different preparations.

Among them is one of Escoffier’s most famous dishes, pêche Melba, peach Melba, in English. It’s a fairly simple dessert where sugar-sweetened, skinned peach halves are set on vanilla ice cream and topped with raspberry puree. With ripe, juicy peaches and ruby red raspberries, Escoffier wisely chose to let their flavour shine by not muddling it with myriad ingredients.

article continues below

Escoffier created the first ­version of this dessert while working as the chef at London’s Savoy Hotel during the late 1890s. During that time Australian opera singer Nellie Melba came to London, performed at Covent Garden, and often dined at the Savoy.

Escoffier and Melba became acquainted and lore suggests that one day she sent him tickets to see her in the Wagner opera Lohengrin, whose set featured a swan-shaped boat.

Escoffier must have enjoyed her performance because the following evening when she came for dinner he created a special dessert for her. To make it, vanilla ice cream was set in a silver-serving dish and topped with fresh peaches. The silver-serving dish was then perched atop a swan carved from ice and Escoffier called his creation pecheau cygne, “peach with a swan,” in English.

When Escoffier left the Savoy and began working at London’s Ritz Carlton he tweaked the dish by also topping the peaches and ice cream with raspberry purée. He also renamed it, calling it — you guessed it — peach Melba.

The dessert was a hit and eventually other chefs around the world began serving it. That, in turn, explains why you now see variations on how peach Melba is made, especially with how the peaches are prepared.

For example, some recipes ask you to blanch, skin, half, pit and then cook the peach halves in simple syrup (sugar dissolved in water).Others ask you to cook halved, pitted peaches in simple syrup and then skin them. And yet others, particularly American cookbooks in the 1960s, go the convenience route and tell you to use packed-in-syrup canned peach halves.

However, in The History Kitchen section of the PBS ­website, pbs.org, they’ve posted what screenwriter/food historian Tori Avey says is the original peach Melba recipe, Escoffier’s words translated from French.

In this case, the peaches are quickly blanched in boiling water, cooled, skinned, halved and pitted. If desired, at this point you can soak the peach halves 10 minutes in acidulated water to help them from discolouring. Now, instead of poaching the peach halves in simple syrup, they are simple sprinkled with sugar, allowed to sit awhile and as they do the sugar dissolves and turns syrupy. The peaches are then served on ice cream and topped with raspberry puree. You also have the options to sprinkle the peach Melba with toasted almonds.

My recipe is similar in style, except I decided to halve the peaches and remove the pits before blanching them and removing the skins. I did that because to make peach Melba you need to use ripe peaches. And when you halve and pit them after they’ve been blanched, you can damage the tender flesh.

Neatly halving and pitting peaches is also much easier if you use freestone peaches. As their name suggests, they have flesh that does not cling tightly to the stone, unlike clingstone peaches, that have flesh that does.

If you bought unripe peaches, they’ll eventually become ripe if you leave them out a room temperature. But you can speed up the process by placing them in a single layer in a paper bag. Seal the bag and leave it at room ­temperature for a day or more and ethylene gas the fruit gives off will quicken the ripening process. To speed it up even more, also put an apple in the bag with the peaches, as it has more ethylene gas than peaches and will further hasten the process.

Peach Melba

Here’s my version of the perfect-for-late-summer dessert that famed French chef Auguste Escoffier invented more than 120 years ago. You’ll need ripe peaches for this. So, plan ahead and make sure the peaches you have will be ripe by the time you make and serve the peach Melba.

Preparation time: 60 minutes

Cooking time: One to two minutes

Makes: four servings

1 1/3 cups fresh or frozen (thawed) raspberries (see Note)

1/3 cup water

1/4 cup icing sugar, or to taste (see Eric options)

4 ripe, small to medium, freestone peaches

1 Tbsp lemon juice

1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract

8 tsp granulated sugar

• vanilla ice cream, to taste

4 mint sprigs

Place the raspberries, water and icing sugar in a food processor or blender, or in the cup that came your immersion (hand) blender. Puree the raspberries. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl, using a small whisk to whisk and press out as much liquid as you can. Cover this raspberry puree and refrigerate until needed.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cut each peach in half and remove the stones. Add the peach halves to the water and cook one minute, or until the skins easily slip off the peaches.

Lift peaches out of the boiling water, set on a large plate and cool until safe enough to handle. Now carefully pull off the skins.

Set peaches in 13- x 9-inch dish, drizzle with the lemon juice and vanilla, and turn to coat. Set peaches cut side up. Sprinkle the top of each peach half with 1 tsp of granulated sugar. Cover peaches and refrigerate one hour. Turn each peach over and let sit one hour more, or until you’re ready to make the Peach Melba. (The raspberry puree and peaches can be prepared to this point many hours in advance of serving.)

When ready to serve, scoop some vanilla ice cream into each of four serving dishes (see Eric’s options). Set two peach halves, curved-side-up, and some of the syrup around them, on top of the ice cream in each bowl. Top peaches with raspberry puree, garnish with mint sprigs, and serve.

Note: If using frozen raspberries, measure them before thawing. After thawing, if there’s a lot of liquid around them, reduce the amount of water you add to the puree.

Eric’s options: Instead of icing sugar, sweeten the raspberry puree with honey, to taste. For added richness, you could also top the peach Melba with toasted, sliced or slivered almonds, to taste. You could scoop the ice cream into the serving dishes an hour or two before serving the peach Melba. After doing so, set the dishes in the freezer and keep there until ready to top with the peaches and raspberry puree.

Fear exists for the purpose of keeping us away from danger. However, the word “dangerous” can mean a million different things to different people. That is because many things fall into the category of danger. Those elements are different for each, and every individual. If we see things as dangerous, we fear them. The question we must ask ourselves is why do we see these things as dangerous? Is it because of something we know, or something we think we know? Is it common knowledge, or is it ignorance? The line between those two concepts seems to blur far too easily. The key to their separation is to dive deeper and deeper into the “why” until you find the root cause of your fear. It is where you will find the difference between fearing spiders because they can be poisonous and fearing a person because society teaches you to. This world is incredibly complicated and all we can do is try to understand each other. The only way to do that is through communication and empathy. At the end of the day, we will never be able to understand exactly what it is like to be in someone else's shoes. We will never see the full picture. Understanding this, is the only way to extinguish the fear. Knowing that we do not and cannot know everything is the only way to end a fear that is ignited by ignorance.

article continues below

To me, there are three types of fear.

Logical fear: the type of fear that tells us to be cautious while driving because someone is at risk of getting hurt.

Dream-restricting fear: the type of fear that holds us back from our dreams and causes us to think of risk as danger when in fact the only danger is failure. But who says failure is a bad thing?

Finally, racism-fueled fear: the type of fear that is fueled by stereotypes and ignorance. It tells people to fear other people who have no intention of harming anyone. Fear was engineered to keep us alive, yet it can also keep us from living, figuratively and literally. It has turned from something meant to keep us safe, to a plague that spreads like wildfire and ensures that no one is safe. We are now in a world where humans fear other humans because of their race, religion or because of their appearance. This is the ugliest form of fear. It is one that divides countries and communities and causes people to take lives, valuable human lives, of kind and wonderful people, out of the fear of losing their own. The type of fear that stops someone at an airport because of the way they practice their faith. It is the type of fear that causes some of mankind's most horrid and unjust actions.

Nonetheless, we have the power to eliminate this fear. We can do this by building bridges among communities and transform the fear into knowledge of, and respect for, one another. We need to stop being okay with believing things simply because the world does. We need to think for ourselves and decide what is a logical fear and what is an ignorant fear. Then, and only then, can we begin to improve the way we see and treat each other, one individual at a time. We can conquer fear, eliminate division, and transform the world into a brighter place, one that replaces fear with hope and sees the end of a never-ending struggle.

It didn’t relate to the preceding sentence, so it seemed at first to be a non-sequitur. Yet there was obviously a purpose and meaning in those words. Internal “this is important” bells went off, because I sensed this was something I needed to understand.

It’s astonishing how the wisdom of a culture can be encoded in such small phrases, embedded in words and stories passed down through generations and known in the bones. And yet, to a person from another culture it can be unrecognizable, incomprehensible. Another language. For that reason, intercultural understanding can be infinitely richer and more valuable than we’d ever suspect.

A few years before his passing, Canadian author Richard Wagamese wrote that the phrase “‘All my relations’ means all.” He explained, “Because when you say those words you mean everything that you are kin to. Not just those people who look like you, talk like you, act like you, sing, dance, celebrate, worship or pray like you. Everyone. You also mean everything that relies on air, water, sunlight and the power of the Earth and the universe itself for sustenance and perpetuation. It's recognition of the fact that we are all one body moving through time and space together. To say these words is to offer a doorway to that understanding to those who hear you. It's to proclaim in one sentence that this experience of living is a process of coming together and that it was always meant to be.”

Trying to understand “all my relations” caused reflections that became a powerful mirror. It’s meant coming to terms with the culture of my birth, its missing pieces, its biases, its emphatic individualism, its competitive ethos. It’s meant reassessing the assumption that the world is zero sum, that my gain is your loss and fighting is unavoidable.

Poking around cultural assumptions, turning over their rocks, isn’t always comfortable but it’s great for learning. When I was twenty I became a Bahá’í, whose teachings encourage people to be unifiers and peacemakers. That can be a stretch when you come from a somewhat confrontational background. At first, I was totally non-plussed by Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement that if two souls quarrel about a question of religion, both are wrong. Even more perplexing was the unequivocal statement that “conflict and contention are in no wise permitted”. There was no mention of this not applying if the other person is wrong, offensive or the one who started it!

“The shining spark of truth cometh forth only after the clash of differing opinions,” was an easier teaching to understand. But that too required learning and unlearning, since the exchange is to be done with such “courtesy, dignity, care and moderation” that “no occasion for ill-feeling or discord may arise.”

It’s been a long, still unfinished road for me, learning about unity, its tones, its intricate music. At times I feel like someone who has grown up in another language, one lacking a certain sound that then becomes very difficult to pronounce, or even distinguish, as an adult.

The small phrase “all my relations” at the end of a talk many years ago contained an invaluable key to understanding that unity isn’t merely an ideal or aspiration. It’s a recognition of our essential reality, where we’re coming from and where we’re going, and infinitely more important than being right or proving a point. It’s so important that it deserves constant mention. For that, I’m profoundly grateful.

Early this week, there was a flutter of consternation within the arts community over COVID-19, the virus that’s now reached pandemic proportions. By Thursday night, announcements of show cancellations — some of them last-minute — had swelled from a trickle to a fast-flowing river.

I first heard of this Thursday. That night, I was set to attend a performance of Lillian Hellman’s The Children’s Hour staged by University of Victoria’s Phoenix Theatre. Then Adrienne Holierhoek, the theatre’s publicist, emailed me with sobering news: the performance was cancelled.

“We’re not going ahead with a public performance, as we’re on the verge of the 250 limit,” she said. Holierhoek would now spend a busy night doing damage control.

She added wryly: “Let’s just say I’m having granola bars for dinner.”

As is the case with many performing arts companies in Victoria and throughout the province, the cancellation was in deference to a recommendation by B.C. health officer Bonnie Henry. On Thursday she suggested cancelling events expected to draw crowds of 250 or more to help contain the highly contagious virus.

That night, the list of cancellations continued to grow. Pacific Opera Victoria’s production of Flight of the Hummingbird, set to run Friday to March 22, is postponed indefinitely. The Victoria Symphony has discontinued its concerts. Dance Victoria says this weekend’s performances of Romeo + Juliet by Ballet B.C. are cancelled.

The Royal and McPherson theatres are closed until further notice.

Yesterday morning, I sat down to write a review of Busted Up: A Yukon Story, which played the Belfry Theatre’s Spark Festival. It’s a first-rate show and was to conclude its run tonight.

Later that morning, the Belfry’s communications director, Mark Dusseault, told me his company had made the difficult decision to cancel further Spark Festival performances. This festival, a showcase of new theatre, was originally to continue to March 22.

“It’s heartbreaking,” said Dusseault.

A decision had to be made quickly. One company was preparing to fly to Victoria from its home province of Newfoundland for Spark shows. The Belfry didn’t want them to invest effort, time and expense, only to learn their run was canceled.

Langham Court Theatre has cancelled today’s final performances of I and You.

Manager Michelle Buck said Langham Court originally considered capping the audience at 75 (the theatre’s capacity is 175) to allow for “social distancing” — that is, leaving physical spaces between attendees.

But in the end, the company — regretfully — decided to play it safe.

“It’s such a good little show,” Buck said. “It’s sad to pull it from underneath them.”

Dusseault, who has worked in theatre for 30 years, cannot remember a situation like this ever occurring before in Victoria. Yes, there have been other calamities: 9/11, the Gulf War, the global SARS outbreak of 2003. But nothing ever shut down the arts scene like COVID-19 has.

Not every theatre company has closed its doors. Blue Bridge Repertory Theatre says no upcoming events at its Roxy Theatre have been cancelled. The Roxy will host a musical tribute to the Beatles March 26 to 29.

It is, of course, disappointing for audiences when performances are cancelled. You not only miss out on the show, there’s the task of getting a refund. Yet for arts organizations, the fallout from this situation is much more profound.

Many companies scrape by to survive. Over the past 30 years, government funding has eroded. Audiences for opera, classical music and theatre are getting older. And in general, the battle for audiences is becoming much more intense.

For example, years ago, direct-to-consumer services such as Netflix didn’t even exist.

A new meme now making the social-media rounds suggests people holding tickets to cancelled shows should consider opting out of a refund. By doing so, you make a donation to the company in question.

It’s a noble notion worth considering. One potential legacy of COVID-19 is that it will shut down some arts organizations permanently. And once they go under, it’s difficult — if not impossible — to resurrect them.

Ours is a culturally rich city. During this difficult time, let us be aware of that, of the fragility and importance of the arts in Victoria."

For instance, there was John Green’s The Fault in Our Stars (2012), a young adult novel (subsequently a film) about a girl with cancer who falls for a boy suffering from the same.

And there’s the 2019 movie Five Feet Apart, about a young woman with cystic fibrosis who becomes romantically involved with an ailing young man.

Langham Court Theatre has just opened Lauren Gunderson’s 2014 play I and You. In this two-actor drama, Caroline, a high-school student with a serious liver ailment, receives a surprise visit from a classmate. Like a cactus flower in an inhospitable desert, young love ultimately blooms.

Caroline — feisty and smart — has never before met Anthony, a decent young man with a heart as big as Kansas. At the beginning, in true rom-com style, the pair spar and bicker furiously before bonding like Super Glue.

I and You was a hit, gleaning critical acclaim and enjoying well over 20 productions since it debuted. Gunderson has, meanwhile, emerged as one of America’s most produced playwrights.

Some will find I and You a touch jejune and sentimental in the manner of after-school TV specials.

A melodramatic surprise ending will leave you either thrilled or groaning. There’s a distinctly YA-lit vibe throughout this 90-minute play (I kept thinking of the classic line, “Stay gold, Ponyboy,” from S.E. Hinton’s The Outsiders).

An audience noticeably younger than Langham Court’s usual crowd responded enthusiastically to Thursday’s opening performance. Certainly this production of I and You, capably directed by John Han, has its share of strengths.

The show benefits from the talents of two promising actors. Jesse Deutscher (Caroline) and Justin Francis Lee (Anthony) offered well-rehearsed, energetic performances.

The detailed set is terrific — Caroline’s bedroom is stuffed with groovy teen detritus: vintage Elvis poster, lava lamp, cat-scratching post, retro-lamps and so on. Wide-screen clips of computer games and music videos work well; all light, video and sound cues were handled adroitly.

The play commences with Anthony, wearing a backward baseball cap, dropping in unannounced. He spouts a cryptic line that turns out to be a quote from Walt Whitman’s famous poem Song of Myself.

Caroline — a tiny girl in a too-big sweatshirt — is bewildered and frightened. Anthony hastily explains he’s volunteered to be her partner for a school assignment. Nonetheless Caroline, who is homebound because of her liver ailment, lashes out at the intruder for 20 or 30 minutes.

This introductory section is heavily salted with sitcom teen speak. “What is wrong with you, super hater?” says Anthony. “Walt Whitman can bite me,” says Caroline.

Eventually she does agree to a partnership — they’ll create a Whitman-inspired poster together. “How do you feel about glitter?” Caroline asks. “Philosophically I’m agnostic on glitter,” says Anthony.

It’s doubtful anyone outside a Neil Simon (or Lauren Gunderson) play actually speaks like this. Happily, about halfway through, the quip-fest subsides and we get to know the characters a little more.

Bon mots on the benefits of Chunky Monkey ice cream and Caroline’s toy turtle give way to heavier subjects. Anthony turns out to be a John Coltrane devotee; she digs Jerry Lee Lewis.

Caroline is a gifted photographer with a Whitman-esque love for minutia; he has just witnessed a terrible tragedy on the basketball court.

Deutscher, as Caroline, sometimes displayed flashes of nuance and a knack for subtle facial expression. And the more the playwright eased up on the shallow-end-of-the-pool banter, the more Lee was able to dig into the character of Anthony.

Gunderson intends to say something brave and refreshing about the fleeting, transcendent beauty of life — never a bad thing. And if I and You sends you back to that tattered copy of Walt Whitman poems on your bookshelf, so much the better.

The show continues at Langham Court to March 14."

Like many business owners, he closed his doors due to the pandemic.

Fisher took the opportunity to finish a three-year project — the transformation of a 1928 REO Speedwagon truck into a panel van.

Manufactured by the REO Motor Company (REO were the initials of its founder, Ransom Eli Olds), the truck saw a production run from 1915 to about 1935. (An American band appropriated the name in 1967.)

Although Fisher’s example started off as a flatbed truck, the Speedwagon (sometimes referred to as a Speed Wagon) was available in a variety of configurations from the factory, including a panel truck (commonly called a panel van).

“The project has been an incredible amount of fun,” said Fisher, whose memories of working with wood include a workbench at the foot of his bed when he was 11 years old. “It is meant to be esthetically pleasing, in some small way a piece of furniture on wheels.”

The project tested his carpentry skills.

“Not everything has straight lines — I had to bend and shape everything,” said Fisher, 62. “It’s similar to boatbuilding.”

The fabrication of the new roof involved fitting together numerous thin strips of wood.

Normally, white oak would be used, but due to our soggy climate Fisher decided to substitute Ipe wood from South America instead. While more durable to the elements, Ipe, also called Brazilian walnut, has a reputation of being a difficult wood to work on. The finished structure was covered in the traditional way — using canvas stretched on the frame.

Fisher also repainted the vehicle.

“Spraying a vehicle is similar to spraying furniture,” he said.

The finished project is meant to be functional — to deliver furniture to clients under all weather conditions — and serve as a rolling calling card for his business.

This is Fisher’s second classic vehicle. He also has a 1955 Ford panel van.

But he advises his clients that if they see him and wave, not to be offended if he doesn’t acknowledge them at the time.

“Driving an old vehicle demands more concentration than a modern one. If I don’t wave back it’s because I have my hands firmly clasping the steering wheel.”

It isn’t Hyundai’s least expensive vehicle yet, but it soon may be. In some markets, Hyundai has already discontinued the Accent, its current five-door subcompact hatchback, giving the Venue the crown. But that hasn’t happened in North America — yet.

The Venue comes in four trim levels, with my tester, the Ultimate model, carrying a sticker price of $24,899.

The Venue is aimed at the urban first-time buyer, and it appeals to that group with a budget-friendly price. Despite its diminutive dimensions, its boxy body contains ample room for friends and cargo.

Headroom is a generous 1,000 millimetres in the front and 980 mm in the back. Legroom is 1,050 front and 870 mm back, with passenger interior volume pegged at 2,602 litres.

My tester had the Ultimate trim level — the fanciest — with premium items more commonly found in luxury brands. The interior is simple, uncluttered and logically arranged.

Comfort items that I didn’t expect include a heated steering wheel, power sunroof, push-button start and climate control.

The rear seatbacks fold 60/40 and the cargo floor has two positions. Cargo capacity is 335 litres with the seats up and 1,148 with them down.

The infotainment system consists of an eight-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability. The menus were easy to decipher and the system response time was good.

Technophiles will appreciate Hyundai’s BlueLink connected vehicle system, which allows users to access some functions — such as remote vehicle lock or unlock, remote start and remote climate control via their smartphone.

The system even has an automatic collision notification function that will call for emergency services in case of a crash.

My tester had navigation built-in, but lesser trims don’t offer that feature.

There is only one engine available, a 1.6-litre four cylinder producing 121 horsepower and 113 pound-feet of torque.

A manual transmission is available — but only in the base model. Every other trim gets a continuously variable transmission).

Power is delivered to the front wheels only — there is no all-wheel-drive option. As if to compensate, drivers can choose a Snow option along with Normal and Sport modes.

Let’s be frank, that last mode is more optimistic than fact. If you do choose Sport, the engine rpms go up, but you don’t really go faster.

If performance is what you’re after, you really should consider the Kona, the Venue’s bigger brother.

Fuel economy is 8.0 litres per 100 km in the city and 7.0 on the highway.

Compared with the Nissan Kicks, another subcompact SUV, power output and fuel consumption are similar.

With a 2,520-mm wheelbase and a 5.1-metre turning radius, the Venue is refreshingly nimble in the city. Unfortunately, the short wheelbase also results in a choppy ride on rough roads.

Apart from premium touches in the cabin, the Ultimate also impresses with its safety suite.

You get forward collision-avoidance assist (with automated emergency braking), lane-departure warning with lane-keeping assist, driver-attention warning, blind-spot collision warning with lane-change assist and rear cross-traffic warning.

While these features have become more common of late thanks to trickle-down effect of technology, it is the first time an entry-level model (albeit the highest trim in the line) has been so equipped.

With certain models, the Venue contrasts its entry-level stigma with a trendy/hip vibe, with eye-catching two-tone paint schemes and flashy wheels.

The Venue might be inexpensive to start. It can even be plain. But dress it up and you can go to town — and that’s the point.

Any country that went it alone would simply lose jobs as employers moved to less enlightened jurisdictions.","As the COVID-19 epidemic ravages our global economy, it’s becoming clearer by the day that the world of work will not survive in the form we once knew it.

No doubt some types of employment will morph into variants not greatly different than before. Tasks built around the telephone or Internet can be carried out from home. We’re already seeing that, though even here the social isolation involved will impose psychological harm.

article continues below

But the broader danger is that firms (and governments) are going to find that humans are more readily replaceable than was thought.

It’s true that during previous recessions, some jobs were lost that were never recovered, as were some lines of business. Yet new opportunities always sprang up to fill the gap.

This time might be different. Machine learning, artificial intelligence and the rise of robotics all offer alternatives to human employment that in many respects are more efficient.

This is the longer-term threat that COVID poses. Just as the virus is laying off millions, new technologies are arriving that can take over their jobs.

A recent study by the McKinsey Global Institute found that in the majority of occupations, at least one third of work is automatable. That translates into 800 million jobs, worldwide, 70 million of them in the U.S., and around eight million in Canada.

The study predicted these losses would occur by the year 2030. And that was before the COVID outbreak encouraged employers to accelerate the process.

A clarification: The suggestion is not that jobs won’t be needed in the world of the future. The suggestion is that humans may not be hired to do them.

Some examples. Plans are underway to build a truck highway from Mexico to Canada reserved entirely for automated vehicles.

The benefits, monetarily speaking, are self-evident. By law, truckers of the human variety are required to take an eight-hour break each day in the U.S., and a 10-hour log-off in Canada. Robots don’t need breaks, don’t fall asleep at the wheel, and don’t get COVID.

Automated check-out lanes are already taking jobs from employees in our stores. And once virtual education replaces the real version, why do we need teachers and professors?

If computers can beat grand masters at chess, and compose music indistinguishable from the “real thing”, I’m pretty sure they can teach algebra.

Now it might be thought, no problem. The automation revolution will grow the world’s economy just as the Industrial Revolution did, and there will be new jobs for all.

But not according to that McKinsey study, which found that while 365 million new jobs will indeed be created, this is less than half the number required to replace those lost.

And again, this was before the COVID outbreak brought home the relative fragility of human labour.

What then is to be done? It has been proposed that governments offer laid-off workers a wage to get by on. In effect, they get paid for staying home.

No doubt there are some among us who would seize the opportunity to broaden their minds, perhaps by taking up art or music.

Yet there is a ton of research showing that people need to be gainfully employed, and not just as a source of income. They develop friendships at work, gain a sense of purpose, and most important, self-reliance.

An Australian study showed that employed people generally enjoy better mental health. It also found that job loss in middle age is particularly destructive.

In short, while paying people not to work is better than letting them starve, it is not a humane solution. Nor is it, financially speaking, a practical model for underdeveloped countries where many of world’s automatable chores are concentrated.

The only feasible option I can see is to entrench the right to work as one of humanity’s basic entitlements. This is the new civil rights issue of our time.

No easy task. Employers will resist, although there’s some history here.

When the Industrial Revolution reached its peak, factory conditions were abysmal. Long hours, dangerous and unshielded machinery, life destroying contaminants, child labour.

But this led to a series of workplace regulations that forced corporations to clean up their act, though they kicked and screamed.

Admittedly it would take an international effort to enforce a right to work. Any country that went it alone would simply lose jobs as employers moved to less enlightened jurisdictions.

Yet what alternative do we have? Job killing must be placed on a similar footing with other evils of the day.

And when better to begin this campaign, as COVID hammers employment? The enemy is already at the gate."

government is miserably failing to understand these vital connections and get the balance right, to the detriment of future generations and other species.","In his 2017 book The Patterning Instinct, Jeremy Lent suggests there are three forms of disconnection that lie at the heart of the global challenges we are creating and that are “inexorably leading human civilization to potential disaster.”

Those disconnections are within ourselves, between us and other people and between people and nature. Lent wrote: “Our minds and bodies, reason and emotion are seen as split parts within ourselves. Human beings are understood as individuals separated from each other, and humanity as a whole is perceived as separate from nature..

article continues below

Lent’s three disconnects brought to mind one of my favourite framings of the principles that should guide us going forward. Forty years ago, in his book The Sane Alternative, the English alternative futurist and economist James Robertson described the SHE future.

SHE stands for sane, humane and ecological, he wrote, where sanity is about balance within ourselves, humanity is about balance between ourselves and other people, and ecology is about the balance between humankind and nature.

Robertson is suggesting here not only that mind and body, reason and emotion should be connected, but that they should be balanced. Similarly, it is not an either/or proposition between “I” and “we”, it is both/and; we cannot ignore individuals and their needs and wishes, but that has to be balanced with the needs and wishes of the group, as the COVID-19 pandemic so powerfully reminds us. And we cannot place the needs of humans above the needs of nature, since we depend upon nature for all that makes life and health possible.

A powerful personal example of the failure to balance both reason and emotion and the wellbeing of people and nature came 30 or so years ago. We were on holiday on Vancouver Island (we lived then in Toronto) and drove through a clear-cut on the way to Tofino. It was truly horrible, disgusting, it wrenched at my heart to see such devastation.

So I wrote a letter to the Times Colonist in which I suggested that this was ecocide, every bit as appalling as genocide, and I wondered how we had raised a generation of people who thought this was OK. (I have not changed my opinion in the intervening years.)

A few months later, back home in Toronto, the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons (the licensing body for physicians) forwarded to me – without comment – a letter from a professional forester in B.C. who not only objected to my views but asked the College to suspend my medical licence. I clearly was not fit to be a physician because I had let emotion cloud my judgement and ignored the good science behind clear-cuts.

Setting aside the bizarre idea that you would want a physician devoid of emotion, I felt saddened by this forester. He could not connect and balance reason and emotion and could not feel the devastation he and his industry were wreaking on the forest. But what was sad for him was a tragedy for the forest and all the life it contains, a tragedy that has grown far greater in the intervening years.

Right now, the Sierra Club of B.C. tells us, “only three per cent of old-growth forests with huge, old trees are still standing across B.C. — and most are on the chopping block."" In fact, they add, “every day more than 500 soccer fields of old-growth forest are clearcut in B.C.” (You can find their campaign to stop this on their website.)

As if that were not bad enough — and not unrelated to this massive forest destruction, B.C. is the province with “with the highest number of species at risk of extinction” — more than 2,000 — noted Sarah Cox in The Narwhal this month. And yet “B.C. still has no endangered species law, despite the NDP’s election promise to introduce one.”

If the challenge we face, as Jeremy Lent and James Robertson propose, is to re-establish connections and balance within ourselves, between ourselves and the community of which we are a part, and between ourselves and nature, then clearly the B.C. government is miserably failing to understand these vital connections and get the balance right, to the detriment of future generations and other species."

This can make or break any police service, and with ongoing demonstrations around the world and police under the watchful eye of the public these relationships are paramount.

Peel’s seventh principle has always stood out for me, it states “police, at all times, should maintain a relationship with the public that gives reality to the historic tradition that the police are the public and the public are the police; the police being the only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the interests of community welfare and existence.”

In a 2003 publication called Changes in the Neighbourhood, Lorne Daniel wrote “nothing creates a community like controversy. Community thrives in crisis. While we may not have tightly-knit communities on a day-to-day basis, we come together quickly in the face of a threat. This is human nature – to become active, agitated, and energized when we perceive a threat.”

Some would argue that in cities like Minneapolis the police have become a threat, and citizens are clearly energized and demanding reforms.

This principle suggests that there is a duty, and a shared responsibility that police officers and every citizen must shoulder in the pursuit of community well-being and existence. Suggesting that the police are the public and the public are the police creates an epic partnership.

Is this partnership faltering, and why? Many would agree that we have continued putting more and more responsibilities on the police, and that officers need to be a jack of all trades on the streets they patrol. Homelessness, mental health and addictions are all serious issues that are taxing our officers, and stressing municipal budgets. Taxpayers are feeling the pinch too, year after year, and are beginning to see that it’s no longer sustainable.

Since many of these problematic issues police are facing are social challenges it’s become very clear that social innovation is critical. Dr. Chad Nilson and the Community Safety Knowledge Alliance acknowledge McConnell Foundation’s Stephen Huddart and have observed that reaching our preferred goals for modern society requires us to challenge the status quo in human service delivery.

Huddart writes “improving outcomes for vulnerable people, creating agile, responsive institutions, and unlocking capital that is currently absorbed by service delivery models that worsen problems they were intended to solve, are goals we can all support, and which social innovation is designed to achieve.” The police were never properly equipped to deliver these services.

So, what’s next and are there better solutions? Some recent discussions with friends and colleagues suggest that increased citizenship would be a great start. In other words, playing more of an active role in their community. After all, Peel suggests that these duties are incumbent on every citizen.

We have policing initiatives such as Block Watch, Crime Free Multi-Housing and others, but are they enough? Volunteers are often at the heart of these programs and they need backup too.

Discussions about many of these challenges are well underway in various neighbourhoods, with more and more residents getting actively engaged. Community groups and neighbourhood champions have started exploring more proactive alternatives. Taxpayers are also getting wise and clearly understand that hiring more police year after year is reactive and unsustainable.

The film Citizen Jane tells the story of Jane Jacobs, an individual who empowered fellow citizens to act, and transform their city. She writes “cities have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody.”

Calling all citizens! This is your opportunity to seek out proactive solutions and be empowered by taking more ownership in your neighbourhood. Consider all the possibilities by exploring best practices that ensure better outcomes. Community safety and well-being is all about connection, relationships that can’t thrive in isolation. Policing must remain a partnership affair – they need us as much as we need them.

That problem will be further exacerbated when students return to school after the shutdown.

Some students will have had the benefit of upgraded access to learning technology, private tutors even parents who themselves are professional teachers. Other students will have had none of that and so the gap between those ready to return and those not ready will be wider than ever.

So, how will teachers decide how to deal with a class which arrives back at school in widely dispersed educational disarray?

How will one student’s readiness to return to classes be measured against another’s?

It will not be through standardized tests and the categorizing of students through the one-shot results of those tests and the representation of those results through letter grades or percentages.

To begin with, and in the interests of full disclosure, I should admit that I am no fan of letter grades as indicators of student performance or readiness to move ahead with learning or anything else about how kids learn.

Nor was I, as a teacher, ever impressed by a parent who said “don’t give me all that edu-babble about my kid - just give me the bottom line, A,B,C or whatever”.

I was tempted to ask the parent “are you an A, B, C or D as a parent”.

Had my cardiologist reduced the complexities of my health status to a letter grade or the results of a single stress test etc. to an A, B, C (or my case “L” for lazy) without further information, prescription or lifestyle advice, I’d be looking for a better cardiologist.

In that same way I’ve never understood how a process as mysterious and complex as learning could be represented by a letter grade or, for that matter a single test result or why anybody would be satisfied with that informational austerity.

Again, if a hospital’s “performance” was reduced to “infection rates, 30-day average mortality rates, re-admissions after surgery, etc.” that certainly removes any thought of professional judgement about patient care decisions.

That’s not to deny the value of some empirical information as a contributing measure of performance in any organization but that kind of information taken alone can be a tempting “sine qua non” which too often leads bureaucrats and politicians down the road to poorly thought out decisions just to bump up the numbers about schools and education generally in the absence of the judgement of professionals .

A misguided dependence on standardized test results has served nobody well, not in schools and certainly not in handling the Pandemic in the U.S.

As a teacher I always considered it my responsibility to understand each student in more comprehensive ways that a test result might indicate. Did I make mistakes in judgement? Of course I did but not often and fewer times again as I learnt more about the broader responsibilities of my profession.

A balanced model of student assessment includes a variety of measures with a variety of purposes, including generally accepted performance standards, classroom revision tests, portfolios in which kids express their understanding of the topic in different ways and individual student assessment which takes into account individual differences about ways of learning.

That means that for the first few weeks back at school there will be a lot of homework - for teachers who will be gathering information from a variety of sources to enable informed decisions about where to go next with individual students, way beyond A,B,C,D,I (incomplete) or F (not ready yet).

Individual students will need to be assessed to detect learning disabilities, reading difficulties, language deficiency, and giftedness.

Happily some districts are moving away from letter grades if only because it implies a understanding that the true purpose of student assessment is or should be for learning not of learning.

As Einstein suggested current problems will not be resolved using the same processes that had created them in the first place.

When schools eventually reopen fully, no matter how long and with what missteps along the way, the notion that every student is learning and achieving in lockstep with every other student will be an invalid assumption - but then it always has been despite how we organize public education and assessment procedures designed to reduce measurement of each individual’s learning progress to an absurd simplicity.

Shortly after the press conference, I turned to Twitter and saw that many folks didn’t share the same opinion. I know that if I am looking for politeness and kind statements, Twitter isn’t the place to turn, but I found many of the comments regarding this tactic to be a little disheartening.

I work in communications and the first thing about communications is knowing your audience. Once you have selected who the intended audience, the next step is tailoring the approach for it to be the most effective.

The goal of getting Ryan Reynolds and Seth Rogen to assist was to reach a younger demographic. The criticisms came from people outside of the intended demographic, meaning it wasn’t an approach directed at them.

Our population in this province is vast and consists of many demographics. Not every approach is going to land well, or even reach everyone. Even when messaging is geared towards a specific demographic, it doesn’t ensure it will be successful.

The two Hollywood actors weren’t being asked to speak as medical professionals, they were asked to assist in reaching an audience that most likely aren’t tuning into government updates.

I know many people who check for the latest Dr. Bonnie Henry and Minister Adrian Dix updates at 3 p.m. on most days. These are the voices they listen to and trust because they relate to them.

If you are reading this, you may think that everyone knows who Dr. Bonnie Henry is. In both cases when I interviewed her, I had many of my friends reach out and congratulate me on landing the interview. For teens and children overhearing these conversations they said, “Who’s Dr. Henry?”

We all know that Henry is amazing and her knowledge and approach has been phenomenal, but there are some young people who may connect with the voices of other BCers.

These young people know that Ryan Reynolds stars in Deadpool and they’ve seen Seth Rogan is one of the many films he starred in such as The Lion King, Neighbors, Knocked Up or Kung Fu Panda.

Horgan’s request for the A-listers help was in hopes of reaching young people who are engaging in parties and larger gatherings that are direct result of higher COVID-19 cases.

As the COVID-19 rates in our province rise, we need to do whatever we can to get people on board. Now isn’t the time to judge why a 20-year-old may prefer to follow the advice of a movie star rather than a provincial health officer.

Personally, I really like the approach Horgan took seeking other avenues. I enjoyed hearing Reynolds’ voicemail to Horgan and the people of B.C., joking of how his mom would like to be picking up young men at the beach. Rogan tweeted out his response that BCers should stay home and smoke marijuana. Both responses were entertaining and garnered attention, and hopefully reached people on the reiterated importance of physical distancing and staying safe.

I have had to turn down invitations to events because I didn’t feel comfortable. I’ve had to have tough conversations with my daughter about turning down invitations to places that she too, really wanted to go. Saying we couldn’t go was hard, I didn’t want to upset friends, and I also really wanted to go.

We’ve been dealing with this pandemic for many months and its been a challenge for many of us. We are not in the clear and there is more work to be done and physical distancing is absolutely necessary. While we know it can be hard to turn down invitations and if a couple movie stars can make that easier for some, I am in full support.

Personally, I think other famous British Columbians should be called upon to aid in this. If we want to get the teens and young adults on board I think we should be asking younger stars from B.C. to step up and help too, such as Finn Wolfhard from Stranger Things and It, Jacob Tremblay from Good Boys, Wonder, and Room, and musician Grimes (who is also Elon Musk’s partner)."

Got a job, got another, rose to the very peak of his profession, and became a beacon of hope and societal good. It’s a great story.

What happened to Masai Ujiri in Oakland on the night of June 13, 2019 was a part of that story. The Raptors had just won the NBA title. And Masai Ujiri, son of Nigeria, was walking towards the court in a cloud of confidence and calm. Alan Strickland, a sheriff’s deputy, stood in his path.

Does the sheriff’s deputy stop a white executive? Maybe. Does he shove him, hard? What about after that executive says, “I’m the president of the Toronto Raptors,” does the sheriff’s deputy shove him again, violently? Does it nearly turn into a fight?

Maybe Strickland would have acted that way with anybody. Some cops are just bad cops, always.

But it was Ujiri. What followed was over a year of questions, potential criminal charges, a civil lawsuit. And finally, Tuesday night, the truth.

Full videos of the confrontation had never been released, until Tuesday night. A long-range view was obtained by KTVU’s Lisa Fernandez in San Francisco, and Ujiri’s California legal team released the body camera footage it obtained last week,as part of a countersuit. Finally, it’s truly clear.

Ujiri was watching a TV in the back when the Raptors won. He hugged longtime equipment manager Kevin DiPietro and headed out to the main arena bowl. Ujiri found his wife, Ramatu; after a few emotional moments together, Ujiri made his way toward the court alone. Strickland was one of the local police tasked with keeping the crowd from the celebration.

The video shows Ujiri is walking slowly. He does not have the special armband the NBA distributed for entry to the court, but is pulling his NBA credential out of his jacket. Strickland puts out both hands and shoves, hard enough to throw Ujiri back. He barks, “Back the f—- up, man!” Ujiri takes a step forward and says, “What did you push me for? You’re pushing the president of the Raptors.” Strickland shoves again, hard. Ujiri’s face is pure anger and bewilderment; he cannot seem to believe this is happening to him. He pushes back.

People run in to separate the two men. After a few tense moments Ujiri reaches the court, where Kyle Lowry waits: the point guard grabs the stunned Ujiri by the wrist and almost unknowingly pulls him to safety, into a fierce embrace.

So let’s add it up. There were witnesses everywhere. There were cameras everywhere. The NBA legal department was involved, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment lawyers were involved, and Ujiri is a rich man. The Alameda Sheriff’s Office had seen the same body camera footage you just saw. They knew what happened. What happened next?

In June, Alameda Sheriff Greg Ahern recommended that Ujiri face a charge of battery of a police officer, which can result in up to a year in prison. Sgt. Ray Kelly, a spokesperson for the department, backed up Strickland’s version of events. The department declined to make the body cam footage public, arguing it might compromise the investigation. You don’t say.

The sheriff’s office had seen the same body cam video you’ve seen, and Ahern, the former head of the California State Sheriffs’ Association, recommended the charge anyway. The DA dropped the charges in October.

In February of this year, Strickland sued Ujiri, MLSE and the NBA for $11 million (U.S.), saying the Raptors president hit him with both fists in the jaw and chest, and had acted with “evil motive amounting to malice.” Strickland went on temporary disability, from which he reportedly earns $224,000 per year, plus benefits.

“It’s an unprovoked significant hit to the jaw of the law enforcement officer,” said David Mastagni, a high-profile employment rights lawyer, told San Francisco’s KPIX-5.

“He has a serious concussion; a templar mandibular joint injury, which is a serious jaw injury.” He added, “This is an issue of credentials or no credentials, not race.” Mastagani’s bio says the Martindale-Hubble service, which has provided background on lawyers since 1868, says “his peers rank him at the highest level of professional excellence.”

Strickland knew Ujiri didn’t have the body cam footage. His word against mine. A shakedown. Getting the footage changed everything.

So what could have happened if Ujiri was walking down the street? Pulled over in a traffic stop? In front of a grocery store? In his own home?

We know what could have happened. We know their names. George Floyd. Breonna Taylor. Trayvon Martin. Michael Brown. Tamir Rice. Eric Garner. Philando Castile. Ahmaud Arbery. The real list of names is so long it would fill books. Wayne Embry is Ujiri’s special adviser. He grew up in segregation-era Ohio, an NBA Hall of Famer, the first Black general manager in the NBA. When he was running the Cleveland Cavaliers, he once found a bullet on his chair in Richfield Coliseum.

Ujiri has filed a countersuit, because he can afford to. He refused to settle, because he could afford to. But in some eyes, he was still a Black man whose word had to be weighed against a white policeman’s, until Tuesday night.

So what would have happened? You probably don’t know the name Dujuan Armstrong. In 2018, the 23-year-old Black father of two reported to the Santa Rita jail in Dublin, Calif., on a burglary sentence that allowed him to serve the sentence on weekends. He died there. According to the Appeal, which writes about the American legal system, when his mother came to claim the body she found her son’s face covered in bruises, his skull smashed open, held together by staples.

The Alameda Sheriff’s Department cited body cam footage in indemnifying its officers, which it declined to release for over a year. It noted Armstrong had drugs in his system, including cocaine. The footage eventually showed he was acting erratically, was surrounded by police officers, was kneed and kicked by two sheriff’s deputies, placed in a spit hood and a WRAP device — a complex harness — and placed on a gurney, where it was discovered he had stopped breathing.

Armstrong died of asphyxiation. The autopsy said his erratic behaviour should not have been fatal. The department was sued over the death, and no longer uses WRAP devices. According to the Appeal, 80 people had died in Ahern’s custody between 2007 and 2019. According to the East Bay Times, the Alameda Sheriff’s Department paid out $15.5 million in settlements and judgments in civil rights cases between 2015 and 2018 alone, on 41 cases, including 17 cases of excessive force. Both were the highest in the Bay Area.

So if you wanted to know why the Raptors rolled into the Orlando bubble with buses painted with the words Black Lives Matter, this was all one more reason. If you wanted to know why there have been protests across America and the world, this was all one more reason. If you wanted to know why the NBA is attaching itself to social justice, to anti-racism and actually digging money from the owners’ pockets to do so, this was all one more reason.

Masai Ujiri’s life had led to that moment. He has not spoken much about this, but said of Strickland, “he stole something from me.” And that’s true.

Now imagine what was stolen from every Black person who doesn’t have his ability to protect themselves with witnesses, and money, and reputation. Ujiri had just won the NBA title. He was, in that moment, a hero to millions. But not everyone.

And now the truth is out, and the truth about Masai Ujiri is a truth about America, and Canada, too. And maybe, in this age and the ones that came before it, that’s all you can ask.

Tele-health consults, fully geared up and properly monitored, should expand the number of patients our family physicians can treat.","It appears changes forced by the COVID-19 pandemic may finally bring some good news.

For years, large numbers of British Columbians have been unable to find a family physician. Instead, we searched the B.C. College of Family Physicians’ website to look for a doctor taking new patients, frequently in vain. Or we phoned around for a local walk-in clinic that could see us, often waiting for days.

article continues below

Perhaps now there is some light at the end of that tunnel.

Between April and June of this year, the number of telephone consults by family physicians rose by 2.4 million province-wide, from near zero in the pre-COVID era. That has to put a dent in the wait times to talk with a GP.

What happened is this. Before the virus struck, family physicians were allowed to consult with patients by phone, but the fee for this service was well below the remuneration for an office visit. That made the option impractical in most cases.

But as the COVID crisis deepened, the Health Ministry raised the fee for phone consults, making them financially more viable. Where before only two per cent of fee-for-service payments to GPs were for tele-consults, now that number is 49 per cent. The rapidity with which tele-consulting has taken off is remarkable.

Moreover, the numbers to date cover only the early stages of the epidemic. It is reasonable to assume that with more experience, the volume of phone consults will rise.

If that happens, there is a genuine possibility we could see an easing in the wait times to talk with a GP.

As well, routine interactions between patient and doctor can be greatly simplified, to everyone’s benefit. Previously a patient would visit her family physician, discuss symptoms, and tests might be ordered.

A follow-up visit would usually be required to review the results, and after that, a prescription might be written which the patient would take to a pharmacy. All of this can now be done by phone, at least in many circumstances. And test results are available online via the LifeLabs portal “My eHealth” or Island Health’s portal “MyHealth.”

These efficiencies free up GPs to treat more patients than the conventional approach permitted.

It’s worth comparing this experience with what is happening south of the border. According to several news reports, only one-third of American GPs feel they have enough cash on hand to remain in practice for more than a month. Several hundred have already closed, or are preparing to do so.

Part of the reason is that the U.S. Medicare plan, which provides health insurance for people aged 65 and over, reimburses family physicians for tele-health consults at only half the rate for an office visit.

It is this fate which the B.C. Health Ministry has avoided. The question is, what happens when the COVID crisis passes by? Do we return to the traditional model based around face-to-face visits?

Hopefully not. What the epidemic has taught us is that there are far more efficient ways of delivering primary care.

Yes, office visits may be the gold standard for certain conditions. There are numerous circumstances where a patient can only be diagnosed and treated properly in a doctor’s office.

And over time, the ideal solution would be a significant increase in the number of family physicians. But that is nowhere on the planning horizon. Our medical schools are barely turning out enough GPs to replace those who retire.

So let’s learn the lesson that COVID has taught us. Tele-health consults, fully geared up and properly monitored, should expand the number of patients our family physicians can treat.

That can only benefit all of us in the long run."

Focusing on any children stuck listening as their parents worked, Freeland made a plea that went straight to every mother’s heart: Please give your moms a hug, she said, and then go clean your rooms.

“I think that would be the biggest present for every mother in Canada,” she said, “and I am speaking from personal experience.”

Freeland gets it — the unsustainable strain on households as parents try to work from home while also trying to care for and educate their children under pandemic restrictions.

As finance minister, she’ll need all that intuition and then some. Fiscal policy is at a turning point, and there is an urgent need for decisive direction.

The generous benefits of the past few months are winding down and recovery has begun, but unemployment — especially in the service sector and other areas hit hardest by the pandemic shutdown — is still sky-high.

And businesses, especially those run by entrepreneurs, are still shutting down in alarming numbers.

Women are having an especially hard time getting back into the workplace, having lost their jobs in larger numbers than men and now left wondering whether their kids will be well taken care of in September.

“It’s hitting mothers particularly hard,” Freeland acknowledged in her first remarks as finance minister on Tuesday.

Government support for these groups — unemployed workers, struggling entrepreneurs, working parents — needs to be revamped, enriched and rushed out the door for a recovery to truly take hold.

Freeland will be the one to drive those initiatives, and the effort undoubtedly will be expensive and long term to allow the recovery to gradually blossom. But that’s probably just the easy part.

Freeland will also have to quickly make some tough calls on the ambitions of her own colleagues, from the prime minister on down, who are talking louder and louder about “building back better.”

The plans to turn the pandemic recovery into an opportunity to confront climate change, develop new competitive advantages, combat racism, eradicate homelessness, eliminate inequality and embrace a digital economy are multiplying and morphing in double time, in the hopes of claiming a spot in the budget or fiscal update this fall. They will all cost serious money, and they won’t necessarily help the people hardest hit by the pandemic.

But the new minister may soon find herself in the same kind of corner as her predecessor.

While she may have a sympathetic ear for the coterie of dreamers, she is squarely assigned to the more practical side of government, where her main job is to maintain fiscal responsibility and promote growth. Although insiders believe she will be less tight-fisted than Morneau, she won’t be able to say yes to everything.

For most of his tenure, Morneau had the benefit of a widely declared fiscal rule in place.

A government-wide commitment to continually reduce the debt burden was obviously not nearly as stringent as the promise to balance the books that the Liberals once ran on, but it was enough of a tool to support Morneau in saying an occasional no.

It was that naysaying, however, that led to a frustrating relationship with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which eventually boiled over and contributed to his resignation this week.

Freeland doesn’t have any fiscal rules at the ready, and she already faces high expectations that she will enable — and finance — a broad policy agenda.

Indeed, when Trudeau launched her new appointment with a visionary speech on Tuesday, he listed many aspirations but made not a single mention of the price tag.

“The time is now to be engaged in bold thinking,” Trudeau said, claiming that since Canada is in solid fiscal shape, the government has “an obligation to invest” in a recovery that addresses inequality, environmental challenges, better health care, better child care and more jobs. She also faces a projected deficit of $347 billion, a ballooning debt that will soon top $1 trillion and gloomy forecasts for a rough recovery that drags into 2022.

The business community sent a warning shot. In a letter to Freeland, the Business Council of Canada urged the government to keep its fiscal powder dry, and to not spend frivolously.

“Canadians need to know that there is a plan to rein in federal spending and ensure the sustainability of government finances,” the letter states.

Freeland sent all the right signals Tuesday to her aspirational colleagues in government as well as parents, the unemployed, environmentalists and people worried about coronavirus.

The juggling act will be in also gaining the confidence of the business community.

But as a successful working mom, she knows all about juggling.

The 2020 Point in Time survey tells us that the people experiencing homelessness in the region have overwhelmingly lost their housing while living in the region, and that high rents, low vacancy rates, and low wages across the region are driving homelessness in Greater Victoria.

Point-in-Time (PiT) Counts are a measure of the minimum number of people experiencing homelessness on a single night. The PiT Count process includes a survey to ask people experiencing homeless about their history, background and needs. The survey results provide a human face to homelessness that aids the community in preventing and addressing homelessnes.

On the night of March 11, 2020, the PiT tallied at least 1,523 people experiencing homelessness across Greater Victoria, and of those, 854 individuals were surveyed. A large majority (84 per cent) of those surveyed have lived in the region for a year or longer, including 42 per cent who have lived here for over five years, and 22 per cent who have lived here their entire lives.

There is a common assumption that housing and homelessness services are drawing people experiencing homels sness to move to the region, increasing demand and making the homeless situation worse. That is not seen in the PiT data.

The top reasons people in the PiT Survey moved here were: because family moved here, to be with family or friends, and to find employment. Individuals also report moving here to access medical services, to attend school, fear for safety due to personal circumstances, amongst many other reasons.

Only a small fraction of individuals who moved to Victoria were already experiencing homelessness.

The real story is that people who live here are falling into homelessness, whether they arrived in recent years or have always lived here. It is a system-wide regional challenge with multiple causal factors including systemic factors, structural factors and individual’s personal circumstances.

Further, the homelessness crisis has roots in Greater Victoria’s housing crisis. A recent Nanos poll showed that 11 per cent of Canadian renters have been homeless, and 25 per cent are worried about coming up with rent for August. Two-thirds of households in the city of Victoria are renters, meaning we can expect those numbers to be higher in Victoria especially since 46 per cent of Canadians entered the pandemic $200 from insolvency.

Greater Victoria’s unemployment rate is at its highest since the Great Depression. If the COVID-19 ban on evictions is lifted, homeless numbers could jump. If CERB and other COVID benefits end, homelessness could skyrocket.

The provincial, regional and municipal governments, in collaboration with local service agencies, have been working hard to keep people experiencing housing instability safe since the pandemic struck. Our entire community benefits from this collective effort.

More than 600 people have been housed indoors since the the pandemic began. Important progress has been made in addressing the unprecedented challenge of the converging emergencies of the COVID-19 pandemic, the opioid epidemic and the homelessness crisis.

Those safety measures have continued to include encampments because, as the B.C. Centre for Disease Control and Ministry of Health’s guidelines state: “Clearing or moving encampments without providing shelter or housing immediately can cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers. This increases the potential for infectious disease spread and may lead to isolation, which also poses health and safety risks to vulnerable people.”

Encampments are not a solution to homelessness, but are in fact a symptom of the ongoing challenges in the region: high rents, low vacancy rates, low incomes and employment insecurity. Reaching zero people experiencing homelessness in the region is the ultimate goal of the agencies and community members.

The considerations they can weigh and prioritize would seem both limitless and relentlessly shifting.

As a parent, an educator, and member of the B.C. Legislative Assembly, I have some concerns about the province’s current back-to-school plan because it gives parents, students, and teachers a stark choice: Be willing to be in the classroom in person, or forfeit your connection to your school community.

article continues below

Fourteen-year-old Grace articulated what this choice means for her: “I have underlying health issues, and so I can’t be in the classroom in the fall, and I’m devastated that this means that I lose my connection to my school, my friends, and my teachers.”

Telling students who can’t or won’t go back into their classrooms in September – whether it’s due to their own health issues or the health issues of a family member – to sign up for online learning through a distributed-learning program is an insufficient response to the many different realities people are experiencing right now.

Students who don’t feel they can go back into the classroom also don’t want to lose the connection to their school community.

For the teachers who feel too much at risk to consider in-person teaching, they also face being disconnected from their school communities, and from the students with whom they have connections.

As this plan is still coming together, and as we see rising rates of COVID-19, there is still the time and opportunity to take into account the concerns of students, teachers, and parents to determine how we can better establish and maintain the strong community connection that schools deliver for everyone.

A hybrid approach that creates a widened school community moves us towards the two outcomes we should be striving for: Preventing transmission and keeping school communities intact.

Teachers would teach either in-class or online, not both.

This would also help to ensure that classroom teachers are not laid off in September, due to lower numbers of students returning for in-class learning.

The teachers could coordinate their efforts to ensure that grade-level delivery is consistent for the mixed in-class and online cohorts – and even find ways occasionally to bring all of the students into the classrooms via online communication tools, allowing for connection between peers to happen, even if it can’t happen in person.

Having dedicated in-class and online teachers would address the challenges that teachers had in June, as they tried to juggle both at the same time. It would also provide the option for teachers who are in high-risk groups to be able to continue teaching within their established school communities.

Coordination between the two teaching cohorts can be built into the plan: The creation of teacher pods, with some in-school and some online, would further enhance connection and consistency of learning experiences for students.

By having the online cohorts, the pressure on the in-class groups diminishes. This will help to make social distancing much easier to achieve for the in-class students and teachers, by likely reducing the number of individuals in a classroom.

Students who are attending in-person would have the ability to join the online group if they have to stay home because of illness – thereby encouraging students not to come to school if they are unwell, and providing them with uninterrupted instruction while they are home.

Students who are in the online cohort may be able to reconsider between terms of the school year about attending in-person. The teacher cohorts would allow for more ability for mid-year adjustments between the two realms.

The COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable. We need to be flexible and adaptable, keeping in mind the importance of what our long-term goals are: Prevention of transmission and strengthening of community.

I never thought I’d look at that text again, but with all the talk about COVID-19 learning loss I was curious.

article continues below

Was anything lost over a lifetime gone forever?

Of course, 60 years later ,the Latin text is online now so I had to take a look.

“Sic fatur lacrimans, classique immittit habenas, et tandem Euboicis Cumarum adlabitur oris.”

Sixty years later, with not a word of Latin during that time, it was, more or less, somehow familiar. I took a stab at it and, with some help from online Google translate, I still had a good sense of Virgil’s narrative, if not anywhere near an exact translation.

“Thus he spoke, tears in his eyes, gives reins for the fleet

and finally Euboian shores”

No doubt scholars of the classics will be all over me, but you get the general idea.

No, the story came back like a wonderful movie I’d never really forgotten; the Trojan fleet arrives on the shores of Italy, Aeneas makes for the Temple of Apollo, where the Sibyl, a priestess, meets him — a wonderful story and an ancient language which had survived in the dark corners of my ageing hippocampus — vague and short on detail, but still in there somewhere.

Thanks to the exponential advances in information technology over the past 60 years, I could find what my age and curiosity thought I had lost forever, but now could find again.

Some years ago, I was supervising and enthusiastic young teacher trainee as she taught algebra — a subject I remember disliking intensely in Grade 12.

She was explaining simultaneous equations and how (a+b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2 and why.

Probably because I knew I would not be facing a test, I found it fascinating — “how did I miss out on this stuff — I sort of remember it now.”

So I looked up “simultaneous equations.” Again, there it all was, in an instant.

The point of all this nostalgia is that what we learned once we probably never forget altogether and, despite time away from the classroom, and with access to the technology to retrieve it, should we so choose, it is still at the tips of our fingers on a computer keyboard.

That being so, I have to wonder if all the dire predictions about kids “losing their education” because of COVID school shutdowns is missing the point. Information learnt in a classroom is not lost because of a pause in school attendance.

In fact, every September teachers retrieve, revisit and refresh previous learning in the first week or so back at school before moving on to the new stuff.

In the age of home-based curricular centred learning technology the particulars of even an obscure Latin text — even algebra can be retrieved and relearned easily enough — if needed for some reason.

What might be lost unless we come up with alternatives such as a safe and workable “Plan B” for getting kids back into schools at least part time is more profound and possibly more damaging to our society than that.

What might be lost is the experience of socio-cultural equity that schools create.

As our schools are moving online during the COVID shutdown, some suburban groups of parent are already considering employing tutors and creating mini-schools at home.

Other parents will buy upgraded home computers or send their kids to independent schools if they have the financial wherewithal to do that .

But if cultural equity through educational opportunity is something we had challenges with before COVID, a reprise of shutdowns of public schools as a “Plan B” will further magnify existing social inequities and cultural class divisions.

So what do we do? One alternative might be shortening the hours of instruction and running the schools on morning and afternoon shifts, which would reduce the school building’s population on any given day and reduce virus risks.

That way kids still experience public school with other kids not from families like their own. That’s how kids learn about living in a diverse community, learn about living in a diverse Canada. That’s something we really don’t want to lose.

And kids who have special individual learning needs? Most learning specialists suggests that when schools do reopen, it is those kids who should be prioritized for as much time as possible in classrooms with specially trained teachers.

Let’s get this “class composition” thing right for those kids this time around.

Finally, let’s face the fact that starting classrooms safely, with reduced class sizes, reduced hours of instruction, specialist teachers, upgraded air-circulation systems, insistence on wearing masks, sanitizing hands and maintaining social distancing if it is all done properly, will be more difficult and more expensive than anybody thought.

But as as Joni Mitchell so succinctly put it: “You don’t know what you’ve lost ’til it’s gone.”

So let’s not save dollars in the short term by allowing COVID to cost public education more than anybody can afford in the long term.

I find it troubling that a word that can be so offensive has found a place in the mouths of youths. They call themselves “savage” if they’ve done something without caring about repercussions or how it affects others around them. When they use this word, it’s viewed as a compliment.

I don’t know if they are aware this was, and still is, a derogatory term used toward Indigenous people. It’s a word that was used to infer Indigenous people weren’t human. If young people knew this, I wonder if it would change their minds about using it.

There are many terms and names that become mainstream that are offensive to communities they reference.

When I heard the Edmonton Eskimos football club was changing its name, it made me sigh and think to myself: “It’s about time.”

There are many sports teams across North America that have their names and mascots derived from Indigenous communities or Indigenous stereotypes. These names have been under scrutiny for many years and not just by Indigenous people.

I welcome the name change of the Edmonton football team and I think it is a great step forward.

When organizations are making decisions such as this one, I don’t think there needs to be consensus. Not everyone has to be offended for a name to be changed and not everyone has to agree. If the name refers to an Indigenous community and the community, or many in the community are offended by it, that’s whose opinion should matter most.

I know many sport fans may have an issue with it and they have many nostalgic memories of the team name and the logo. There is bound to be the argument, “That’s what it’s always been, what’s the problem?”

I hear these reactions and I understand, I really do. Change is hard for all of us. The team was founded in 1895 and officially adopted the name the Edmonton Eskimos in 1910. I am not sure what connotation the word “Eskimo” had in 1910, or what the Inuit community thought of the word being used in the team’s name at that time. I do know that words’ meanings and appropriateness change over time.

I am 38 years old and when I was a child, other children would ask me: “Are you an Indian?” The word “Indian” was used back then, and hopefully, no one today would ever ask me that same question with that phrasing today.

Politically correct terms have changed over the years. When I was in middle school, my peers asked me if I was “Native.” By my late teens. I was asked if I was “First Nations.” Then the questions changed to “Aboriginal” and now the word is “Indigenous.”

As correct terms evolve, we can do our best to evolve with them and listen to others who can correct us when a term or phrase being used can be deemed offensive. We can’t all stay up-to-date on everything all the time, and that’s when we can rely on teaching moments as they happen.

With the Edmonton team the name has been under scrutiny for a while, it’s not something that just happened overnight.

I am of First Nations and Inuit descent, and my family is from Fort Chipewyan in northern Alberta. I was adopted at birth and not raised in an Indigenous home. I am very proud to have Inuit roots even if I don’t know very much about my culture.

I have seen online the support of Inuit leaders and Elders toward the decision to change the name of the Edmonton team.

In the United States, the Washington Redskins football club has announced its name change as well. It has had the same name since 1937. For the 2020 season it will be called Washington Football Team.

I am impressed that these institutions have committed to doing better and in this process they are publicly demonstrating the importance of respecting Indigenous people. It’s steps like this that start conversations and demonstrate why using the term “savage” isn’t OK."

Instead, change usually comes from the bottom up.

Occasionally — when faced with intransigence — that change has to come through violence and revolution, but more often, it happens relatively peacefully and in an evolutionary manner, although not without the need for anger, determination and confrontation on occasion — witness the Black Lives Matter movement.

Other recent examples include the growing acceptance of gay marriage and the youth climate strikes.

The concept of Conversations for a One Planet Region — a non-profit community organization we established in November 2019 after almost three years of working as a loose network — is rooted in this understanding that all politics is local. We believe that before we can take effective action we need to learn about, discuss and understand both the global and — importantly — the local level implications of the massive and rapid global ecological changes we have created.

The word “conversation” is key: We believe our discussions about these issues must be local and in person, face-to-face to the extent that is possible in the present circumstances. A second important reason for keeping the conversations local is that it is an important form of community building.

Thus, we use only local speakers/conversation leaders, because we believe we have more than enough knowledge, expertise and experience right here in the Greater Victoria Region to create a One Planet region.

Local change and local action are important, indeed vital, but they need to be rooted in a very different set of values to those that drive decision-making today, not just in our own Western democratic society, but globally. In our work, we have come to see what we are doing as encouraging a form of cultural evolution, looking for ways to accelerate the change in the deep cultural values that lie at the heart of our problems.

In his recent book, The Patterning Instinct, which explores “the deep historical foundations of our modern worldview,” Jeremy Lent identifies what he calls root metaphors.

They include the notion of “nature as machine” and our belief in “conquering nature”; the idea that indefinite growth is both possible and desirable, and the idea that it is normal to be selfish and pursue our own self-interest rather than the welfare of the group or community.

Lent is clear that if we are to achieve the deep transformation of civilization that is needed, we must change these root metaphors and establish new core values. He has identified three sets of values as “foundational principles for our major decisions”: An emphasis on quality of life rather than just how much wealth and “stuff” we have; a sense of shared humanity where we are part of and have responsibilities to other people; and a commitment to environmental sustainability rooted in a sense of connection to nature and other species.

So in our next series of monthly Conversations starting in September — necessarily online at present — we will begin by exploring how values shift, how we can identify or stimulate key social tipping points and accelerate social and cultural evolution locally toward a commitment to becoming a One Planet Region.

Then, in the following three months up to the end of the year, we will explore in turn each of the three core values that Jeremy Lent has identified.

Clearly, understanding our situation and recognizing the values shift that is necessary has to be widespread, and not confined to a small group who get it already.

So we are committed to both broadening and deepening the rather narrow base of those who have been engaged in the Conversations we have been having. We urgently need a region-wide Conversation about the core values that are required and their implications for the individual and collective decisions we must make if we are to successfully make the transition to a healthier, more just and sustainable future for our children and the generations beyond them.

You don’t have to venture far in most cities to see police lights flashing and hear sirens wailing. It has become disturbingly common especially in the heart of most downtown cores.

This week, we cast some of that light on Peel’s Sixth Policing Principle, which states “police use physical force to the extent necessary to secure observance of the law or to restore order only when the exercise of persuasion, advice and warning is found to be insufficient.”

Some would argue that the use of force by many police departments and their officers seems to be on the rise. It’s a complex problem that certainly merits close attention, and a lot more research.

Let’s face it, modern policing has provided more tools to secure observance of the law and restore order than ever before. As civilians, we would prefer an officer’s persuasion, advice or warning over staring down the barrel of gun, being stunned by a Taser, struck with a baton or pepper sprayed — anytime.

Last week, the Ontario Human Rights Commission released a disturbing report on their inquiry into racial profiling and racial discrimination of Black persons by the Toronto Police. It’s their second interim report. The data analysis ranges from 2013 to 2017.

The findings indicate that black people represent almost 32 per cent of people charged while they only make up 8.8 per cent of the population in Toronto. There has been an immediate call for action by the commission, and many others.

The Special Investigations Unit, which is responsible for investigating incidents of death, serious injury, sexual allegations and assaults, involved Black people in 25 per cent of all investigations.

Further findings indicated that 39 per cent of cases are not investigated by this unit because they involve a lower-level of force, which begs the question: Who is investigating those cases?

There are so many questions now being raised regarding matters where the police have used force, and the public is demanding answers. It’s complicated further when police investigate these matters themselves with little or no civilian oversight.

Further frustration stems from how long many of these investigations take. The RCMP watchdog is recommending statutory deadlines in order to speed up this process and have their officers respond in a timelier manner.

The Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP says that their case findings are often sent to the police service for further input before a final report is completed, and this can sometimes take years.

It’s little wonder then that the public or a victim loses faith in the police. Remember, justice delayed is justice denied.

The current state of policing should encourage us to seek out the best ways possible to reduce the need for officers to use force, although it will always be necessary in some cases. Training is always the first and best line of defence so perhaps more verbal judo, de-escalation tactics or simply having a subtler approach could save more lives.

Every police incident is unique, and can often be unpredictable so officer safety is paramount. However, we must protect everyone in these circumstances, especially those who have been marginalized and are most vulnerable.

In Margaret Wheatley’s book titled Turning to One Another: Simple Conversations to Restore Hope to the Future, the author shares a poem we can all learn from.

In it, she writes: “Remember, you don’t fear people whose story you know. Real listening always brings people closer together.”

Perhaps we should all start listening more, including police officers. We must all strive to resolve our problems peacefully. We might fear people a lot less if we just took the time that was necessary to learn their stories before resorting to force of any kind.

I’ll start with what we know for almost certain. (“Almost”, because every day brings a new revelation that casts doubt on prior assumptions.)

article continues below

First, those Canadians most vulnerable to serious illness and in some instances death, are elderly. In B.C., the average age of death from COVID-19 is 85. There have been virtually no fatalities among people under 40.

Second, by far the majority of fatalities, countrywide, have occurred in nursing homes. As of May 25, 81 per cent of deaths were recorded in these facilities. Five nursing homes have lost more than 40 per cent of their residents to the virus (all were in Ontario and Quebec.)

After that, things grow progressively less certain. Does shutting down various sectors of the economy and imposing social distancing work?

With near certainty yes, if you mean does it reduce the number of infections. But if you mean does it reduce the death rate, that is less clear.

Let’s start with B.C. and work outward. Initially, when the disease first appeared, the number of infections in our province climbed rapidly from a handful in February, to between 65 and 90 per day between mid-March and late April.

At that point the shutdown took effect, and over the following two months, the daily rate subsided, rarely exceeding 20, and usually fewer. Is that evidence the policy worked?

I believe so, because as soon as the shutdown was eased, the infection rate began to creep back up again, reaching about 40 a day in late July and the mid-80s in August.

This would seem to suggest the hard shutdown did indeed flatten the infection curve. That was important early on, because it was feared a flood of infections would swamp our hospital system.

But now the death rate. From a height of six per day in early April, fatalities declined in a more or less straight line thereafter, with scarcely any recorded in the last days of July and early August (the most recent data I have).

That is to say, the death rate did not rise as the shutdown was lifted. Instead, it fell. The same is true of hospitalizations. (The number of COVID patients currently in hospital, as of Aug. 6, was 13.)

There are several conceivable explanations.

Maybe those most vulnerable to the disease died early in its onset. Certainly that happened in nursing homes.

Or instead, perhaps our modes of treatment have improved. That seems likely.

But there’s a different possibility to consider. Perhaps, all along, death rates were not particularly sensitive to blunt measures such as shutdowns. Maybe, these are not so effective as we thought.

So far, these are B.C. numbers only. Some other jurisdictions, notably the U.S., are seeing different results.

Nevertheless we can bolster this suggestion. A study published in the British medical journal The Lancet on July 21 examined the experience of the top 50 countries ranked by their number of COVID-19 cases.

It found that high numbers of deaths were associated with increased obesity and large disparities in income. This might explain, in part, why fatality rates in the U.S. are higher. That country leads most developed nations in obesity and income inequality.

On the other hand, the study found that rapid border closures and full lockdowns did not affect death rates. At a minimum, that should be food for thought.

Where does all of this leave us? Clearly, nursing homes should remain our immediate centre of attention. Everything possible must be done to make them virus-proof.

And elderly Canadians should be advised to take extra care.

After that, though, the uncertainties mount. If fatalities remain low, but the infection rate rises, even to pre-shutdown levels as it is now doing, are we willing to inflict further economic and social turmoil to deal with this?

At some point, we’re going to have to normalize a disease that might be with us for years. That might mean stratifying the population, with more comprehensive protections for those at serious risk, and less-intrusive measures for those who are not.

And don’t pin your hopes on a vaccine. Canada’s chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, has warned that if one is found, it’s unlikely to represent a silver bullet.

Personally, I would want to see much stronger evidence that large-scale shut-ins will suppress fatalities in jurisdictions such as B.C., before going this way again.

Easily said, of course. As someone who ran B.C.’s health ministry once upon a time, I know how much more complex things look from the inside than they do from outside.

I’m also aware how little room to manoeuvre public health officials such as Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix have in a climate of fear and near panic.

All the more reason to keep the debate focused, as much as possible, on what the data are telling us."

The initial campaign to suppress the spread was so successful it left the impression the pandemic could be beaten.

It can’t.

It’s a highly-contagious virus that spread all over the world in a few short weeks. It’s persistent, sneaky and relentless. Without a vaccine, the idea of eradicating such a virulent plague is a lost cause.

The best to be hoped for is that the infection rate can be managed to stay below the limits of health resources. That was the thrust from the beginning of the message to bend the curve.

No one ever promised to drive the curve down to zero. But it flat-lined for so long it looks like people started assuming the crisis was over and B.C. could carry on indefinitely with a paltry handful of new cases a day.

So there’s consternation since the case count started escalating in July, to the point where it bounced back to near record highs this week. There were 84 new cases Friday, the third day in a row that has matched the sky-high levels in March.

The saving grace is that the profile of the pandemic seems to have changed. Far greater numbers of younger people are testing positive comparatively, and they don’t get as sick.

So the hospitalization rate — 12 patients as of Friday — remains far below the level that would send the health care system to condition red.

Twenty-somethings are getting it at twice the rate they were in the spring and that age group now has the largest number of cases. The renewed concern about the case count has prompted some calls to restore the restrictions that were imposed in the spring and relaxed in two phases through May and June.

But the increase in cases was expected when the re-start of the economy began. It’s literally the cost of doing business.

“No surprise,” provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said this week. “As we knew, as we started to increase and open up and move into our restart phases, we were going to see more cases.”

The modeling shows that slamming more restrictions back in place would curb the caseload. But the government intends to resist any thought of renewing restrictions, unless it becomes unavoidable. The economic destruction and resulting job loss looks to have reached the point where government sees returning to more stringent restrictions as a last-ditch option.

Another reason lies in the new analyses this week confirming the obvious: Lower socio-economic groups are having a harder time coping.

While Henry manages the epidemiology, politicians are dealing with demands for hundreds of millions of dollars more in aid and reports of thousands of businesses closing.

Premier John Horgan spent Friday in a sometimes-testy debate with Opposition Leader Andrew Wilkinson on the government’s economic response.

Wilkinson highlighted unemployment statistics, business closures and the upcoming deadlines to pay billions in taxes that were deferred earlier in the year. Horgan said the official economic response plan — worth $1.5 billion — is due to be released in early September. The government plans to be as flexible as possible with companies that can’t pay taxes at the end of September, he said.

The reluctance to clamp down again and the determination to open schools suggests B.C. is nearing the limits of assistance. The emphasis will be on reacting to new cases under current protocols, with tactics like 500 new contract tracers soon to be hired.

Henry said that will “ensure that we can continue with our restart.” They’ll do so in the face of modeling that predicts “the number of new cases may continue to increase this summer.”

The escalation stems from something that’s always been a given, but never been made clearer. It’s the innate human need to socialize. People can close themselves off from contact for a brief period of time, but then they have to go out and mingle with others. The pandemic has revealed the strength of that drive, even when it’s foolhardy and potentially lethal to do so. It’s another reason why going back to stricter limits is being resisted.

What if people just ignore them?

Aug. 22: A New York court issues a warrant for the arrest of Huawei Technologies chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.

Dec. 1: Canadian authorities arrest Meng at Vancouver's airport after an extradition request from the Americans. The news becomes public on Dec. 5.

Dec. 6: China demands Canada release Meng and ""immediately correct the mistake"" officials made in arresting her. The Chinese say they were not briefed on the reasons for Meng's arrest. In Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Meng's case is part of an independent legal process with no outside political influence.

Dec. 7: Meng appears in a Vancouver court, where allegations of fraud are laid out. The U.S. alleges Meng misled American banks in a bid to get around American sanctions on Iran.

Dec. 8: Canada's ambassador to China, John McCallum, is summoned to a meeting with China's assistant foreign minister so the country can register complaints about Meng's arrest.

Dec. 9: China summons the American ambassador to China to lodge similar complaints about Meng's case and demand the U.S. rescind the order for her arrest.

Dec. 10: Chinese authorities arrest two Canadian men. Michael Kovrig, who was on leave from Global Affairs Canada, and entrepreneur Michael Spavor. Kovrig's arrest becomes public on Dec. 11. Spavor's becomes public on Dec. 12.

Dec. 11: Meng is released on $10 million bail. U.S. President Donald Trump tells Reuters that he would ""certainly intervene"" in Meng's case ""if I thought it was necessary"" to help forge a trade deal with China.

Dec. 12: China's foreign ministry says it has no information about Kovrig but says the organization he worked with — the International Crisis Group — was not registered in China, making its activities in the country illegal.

Dec. 13: Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, says the arrests of the two Canadians were plainly a response to Meng's arrest. China's foreign ministry says Kovrig and Spavor have been detained on suspicion of ""endangering national security.""

Dec. 14: Canadian officials are granted consular access to Kovrig, and McCallum meets with him in Beijing.

Dec. 16: Canadian diplomats in China are granted consular access to Spavor.

Dec. 20: Indictments unsealed in the United States allege two Chinese citizens targeted companies in Canada and around the world as part of a years-long hacking campaign to steal data.

Dec. 21: Kovrig's employer, the International Crisis Group, says he has not been given access to a lawyer while in custody. A source familiar with the conditions of Kovrig's detention says he is questioned three times a day and kept in a room with the lights on continuously. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland formally demands both men be let go, calling in a statement ""for their immediate release."" Similar statements come out from the United States, Britain and the European Union.

Dec. 24: China's foreign ministry calls out the U.S., Britain and EU, saying the trio should be condemning Canada for Meng's arrest.

2019

Jan. 3: At a news conference, China's prosecutor general Zhang Jun says Kovrig and Spavor ""without a doubt"" violated Chinese law. He says the investigation is also following the rule of law but doesn't provide more details about the allegations.

Jan. 7: The Prime Minister's Office says Trump has affirmed his respect for judicial independence. In a summary of a phone call between Trump and Trudeau, the PMO indicated the leaders discussed the high-profile U.S. extradition request — though Meng was not named — and agreed on the importance of respecting the independence of judges and the rule of law.

Jan. 9: China's envoy in Ottawa suggests Canada and its Western allies are white supremacists for calling for the release of two Canadians imprisoned last month by his country's communist government. Ambassador Lu Shaye makes the accusation in an op-ed in the Hill Times.

Jan. 14: Trudeau says he's very concerned to see China ""acting arbitrarily"" by applying the death penalty to a Canadian convicted of drug trafficking. He says Canada will do all it can to intervene on Robert Lloyd Schellenberg's behalf when a court in Dalian in northeastern Liaoning province announced it had given Schellenberg the death penalty after reconsidering his case.

Jan. 15: China expresses its ""strong dissatisfaction"" with Trudeau over his criticism of Schellenberg's sentence. Trudeau should ""respect the rule of law, respect China's judicial sovereignty, correct mistakes and stop making irresponsible remarks,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying says.

Jan. 16: The U.S. State Department says China's death sentence against Schellenberg is ""politically motivated."" A statement says U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Freeland spoke and ""expressed their concerns about the arbitrary detentions and politically motivated sentencing of Canadian nationals.""

Jan. 17: Ambassador Shaye says Canada's arrest of Meng was an act of ""backstabbing"" by a friend. Lu warns of ""repercussions"" if Canada bars the firm from its new 5G network for security reasons, as have three of its intelligence-sharing allies.

Jan. 18: Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale says the government's decision on whether to ban Huawei from being used in Canada's next generation 5G wireless network will not be influenced by threats of retaliation from China.

Jan. 22: China demands the U.S. drop a request that Canada extradite Meng. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Meng's case was out of the ordinary and Canada's extradition treaty with the U.S. infringed on the ""safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens.""

Jan. 23: Ambassador McCallum says there are strong legal arguments Meng can make to help her avoid extradition to the United States. Speaking to Chinese reporters a day earlier in the Toronto area, McCallum listed several arguments Meng's legal team can make in her defence.

Jan. 24: Trudeau dismisses calls to remove McCallum following his comments to Chinese reporters, saying such a change wouldn't help the two Canadians detained by Chinese authorities get home any sooner. Later, McCallum says he ""misspoke"" when he suggested detained Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou had a strong case to avoid extradition to the United States.

Jan. 25: McCallum tells StarMetro Vancouver it would be ""great for Canada"" if the United States drops its extradition request. ""We have to make sure that if the U.S. does such a deal, it also includes the release of our two people. And the U.S. is highly aware of that,"" he told the Star.

Jan. 26: McCallum resigns as ambassador to China at Trudeau's request.

Jan. 28: The U.S. Department of Justice formally levels criminal charges against Huawei, two subsidiaries and Meng. The charges, contained in two newly unsealed indictments, allege that Huawei misrepresented its ownership of a Hong Kong-based subsidiary to circumvent American sanctions against Iran. Furthermore, they say Huawei stole telecommunications technology, trade secrets and equipment from U.S. cellphone provider T-Mobile USA. Meng is charged with bank fraud, wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit both. In a statement, Huawei denied committing any of the violations cited in the indictment.

Jan. 29: The Canadian government says it has received a formal request for the extradition of Meng, who appears in a Vancouver court to change the people who are providing her with some of the financial sureties for her release.

March 1: The Justice Department gives the formal go-ahead for the extradition case to proceed.

March 3: Meng's defence team announces it has filed a notice of civil claim alleging ""serious violations"" of their client's constitutional rights.

March 4: China accuses the two detained Canadians of acting together to steal state secrets. Trudeau dismissed the allegation made in Chinese state media, saying: ""It is unfortunate that China continues to move forward on these arbitrary detentions.""

March 6: A lawyer for Meng tells a judge the United States bid for extradition raises serious concerns about the political motivations behind the case.

March 14: Huawei pleads not guilty in a New York court to charges accusing it of plotting to violate Iran trade sanctions. Lawyers enter the plea in federal court in Brooklyn, two weeks after Huawei pleaded not guilty to separate federal charges filed in Seattle accusing the company of stealing technology from T-Mobile.

March 22: A judge orders the RCMP to provide copies of the content on seven electronic devices owned by Meng after they were seized when she was arrested. Justice Heather Holmes of the British Columbia Supreme Court says the RCMP must make copies of data on an iPhone, an iPad, a Macbook Air, a Huawei phone, two SIM cards and a flash drive.

March 29: The federal government says it is considering subsidizing farmers hit by China's $2-billion ban on Canadian canola imports.

April 29: Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe says Ottawa needs to treat Chinese imports with the same scrutiny China is showing Canada's canola shipments.

May 1: The federal government changes a payment program for canola farmers to help those affected by China's decision to ban the Canadian product.

May 2: China suspends the export permits of two Canadian pork exporters, including Quebec-based Olymel LP, amid growing tensions between the two countries.

May 8: Meng's defence team tells a judge it plans to argue that she shouldn't be extradited to the United States because she hasn't committed fraud under Canadian laws and her arrest was unlawful.

May 9: Canadian diplomats are joined in a Chinese courtroom by American, British, French and German colleagues to watch an appeal in Schellenberg's case.

May 16: China says it has formally arrested Kovrig and Spavor, bringing them closer to trial on vaguely defined state security charges. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman says they have been arrested for allegedly stealing state secrets. Goodale says the federal government is ""deeply concerned"" about China's decision, adding that no evidence has been produced to indicate any validity to allegations made against them.

May 23: China's ambassador to Canada says the bilateral relationship is at ""rock bottom"" compared to any time since diplomatic ties were first established decades ago. In prepared text for a speech, Lu Shaye says he's saddened Canada-China relations are at what he called a ""freezing point.""

June 5: Lawyers for the RCMP and Canada Border Services Agency deny allegations that their officers searched Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou's phones and electronic devices after a border official wrote down her passwords. A joint response filed in court to Meng's civil lawsuit says a border officer asked Meng for her phone numbers and passwords in case he was required to search the devices for customs or immigration purposes. Meng's civil lawsuit filed in B.C. Supreme Court alleges ""serious violations"" of her constitutional rights and accuses officers of detaining and questioning her for three hours before notifying her of her arrest.

June 13: Freeland rejects the purported view of former prime minister Jean Chretien that the extradition request be cancelled to improve relations with China and win the release of Kovrig and Spavor. Freeland said while she respects Chretien, Canada is either a rule of law country or it is not. Chretien's comments were reported in the Globe and Mail citing anonymous sources.

June 24: Defence lawyers for Meng ask Ottawa to stop the extradition process against their client, saying the request made by the United States was for political purposes, not legitimate law enforcement reasons.

Aug. 20: Court documents released ahead of Meng's extradition hearing suggest a Canadian border official questioned her about her business before the RCMP arrested her. The nearly 1,100 pages of material released by the court were collected by Meng's defence team.

Aug. 21: Meng's lawyers allege Canadian officials acted as ""agents"" of American law enforcement while she was detained at Vancouver's airport for three hours ahead of her arrest. In court documents, they point to handwritten notes by Canadian officers indicating Meng's electronics were collected in anticipation of a request from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States.

Sept. 4. Business consultant Dominic Barton is named as Canada's new ambassador to China.

Sept. 23: The Crown says Canadian officials followed the law when they detained Meng and the defence has no proof to substantiate its ""conspiracy theory"" that she was illegally arrested. The Attorney General of Canada says in court documents that there's no evidence to suggest that the RCMP or the FBI asked border agents to elicit information from Meng during the detainment.

Sept. 24: A lawyer for Meng says there was nothing ""routine"" about the way she was questioned by border officials before she was read her rights and informed of her arrest as Meng's defence team asks the B.C. Supreme Court to compel the release of further documents to support its arguments ahead of her extradition hearing in January.

Oct. 1: A Crown prosecutor tells a judge Canadian border guards mistakenly gave the RCMP passcodes to electronic devices belonging to Meng when she was questioned at the Vancouver airport. The Crown says when the border agency realized it had made a mistake, it told the RCMP the codes could not be used or shared because they'd been obtained during a border examination.

Oct. 29: The federal government says Canada's new ambassador to China has met with Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

Oct. 31: In documents, Meng's lawyers maintain there is an ""air of reality"" to an allegation the RCMP illegally shared details of her electronic devices with the FBI, despite new affidavits from the Mounties denying the claim.

Nov. 5. A Chinese ban on the import of Canadian pork and beef products estimated to have cost farmers almost $100 million is lifted.

Nov. 24: Canada's new foreign affairs minister spends an hour in talks with his Chinese counterpart over the fate of Kovrig and Spavor. Francois-Philippe Champagne spoke with China's Wang Yi a day earlier at a G20 meeting of foreign ministers in Japan.

Nov. 28: Lawyers for Meng say the United States is ""dressing up"" its complaint that she violated sanctions as a case of fraud as they ask the B.C. Supreme Court to decline her extradition. In court documents released, Meng's legal team says the alleged misrepresentation does not amount to fraud and the transactions processed by HSBC were not illegal in Canada.

Dec. 2: Meng says she has experienced feelings of helplessness, torment and struggle since being arrested, but no longer fears the unknown. In a post on the Chinese telecom company's website, Meng says she has passed the time on bail in one of her homes in Vancouver reading books, chatting with colleagues and painting.

Dec. 10: Justice Minister David Lametti says he is troubled that Kovrig and Spavor have been denied access to lawyers as they face trials where convictions are virtually assured. Meanwhile, Meng wins an application in the B.C. Supreme Court for more documents to be disclosed as she alleges there was an abuse of process during her arrest.

2020

Jan. 23: A lawyer for Meng argues the extradition case against her is a test of whether courts will reject foreign charges that run contrary to Canadian values as a hearing wrapped up in the B.C. Supreme Court. The hearing focused on the legal test of double criminality. Crown counsel Robert Frater says the judge does not necessarily need to consider American sanctions law for the allegations to amount to fraud in Canada.

March 13: Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese Embassy in Canada says Kovrig has been allowed to have a telephone conversation with his father, who is very ill. The embassy says in a statement that they allowed the call for humanitarian reasons, and it also says Kovrig and fellow detainee Michael Spavor are being given better food to strengthen their immunity against the novel coronavirus.

May 27: Holmes rules against Meng on the double-criminality argument. The B.C. Supreme Court judge says the allegations against Meng could constitute a crime in Canada.

June 15: Lawyers for Meng accuse authorities in the United States of misleading the B.C. Supreme Court judge presiding over the extradition case. Meng's defence team says it is seeking a stay in the proceedings arguing that U.S. case records are ""grossly inaccurate and based on deliberate and/or reckless misstatements of fact and material omissions, thereby constituting a serious abuse of the extradition process.""

June 19: China charges Kovrig and Spavor with spying. Kovrig was charged in Beijing on suspicion of spying for state secrets and intelligence. Spavor was charged in Dandong city near the North Korean border on suspicion of spying for a foreign entity and illegally providing state secrets.

Aug. 25: Meng loses her battle to have the contents of six confidential documents released to her legal team after arguing in Federal Court that the redacted documents would support the position that their client suffered an abuse of process during her arrest. Justice Catherine Kane says the information contained in the documents is not relevant to the allegations of abuse described by Meng's legal team.

The majority of residents forced to flee the fire have been allowed to return home and authorities have said they hope to lift the evacuation order for 74 remaining properties soon.

Evacuation alerts covering more than 3,700 other properties have also been lifted.

The acclaimed author said he enjoys searching the web for must-see sites of a far-off city, checking out the availability of flights and hotels, and calculating the cost of his travel itinerary.

But when it comes time to book, King would rather see the world from the comfort of his home in Guelph, Ont.

""I can have a little espresso at my desk, and look all this stuff up, and it often feels like I've travelled there,"" King, 77, said in a recent phone interview.

""If I don't travel again, I don't know that I'll miss it.""

This weariness of wanderlust animates King's new novel, ""Indians on Vacation,"" which hit shelves Tuesday.

The story follows Canadian couple Mimi and Bird on a peripatetic mission across Europe to recover a family medicine bundle that a long-lost relative absconded with a century earlier.

As they drift from one destination to the next, the two must navigate their conflicting tourist temperaments.

Mimi, with her trusty guidebook in hand, believes that travel is ""broadening."" Meanwhile, Bird, like the book's author, is skeptical that there's much to be gained by straying too far from home.

""When we travel, a lot of times, the thing we come away with is we've been entertained,"" said King.

""I don't know that we feel any differently towards the people that we see on our travels. We find them interesting, sometimes even exotic. And for a moment, perhaps we have a kind of broadening. But I think by the time people get home, that's tightened up again.""

If anything, travel can show that prejudice knows no borders, said King, who was born in the U.S. and is of Greek and Cherokee descent.

From mountain towns to major cities, King said he's often confronted by racist stereotypes of Indigenous Peoples while abroad, including a photographer in France who asked him to pose with a pool stick as if it were a spear.

""What they want is that inauthentic historical image that Hollywood has made up over the years,"" said King.

""It's always the one kind of Indian they've got because the others don't play well visually. Me in a T-shirt and a pair of walking shorts — God forbid anybody see me in walking shorts — that just doesn't do it.""

In writing ""Indians on Vacation,"" King said he wanted to ""play against type"" by depicting Indigenous characters who are well-off enough to travel the world, while still engaging with the historic inequities that have made such portrayals a rarity in popular culture.

As the COVID-19 pandemic has closed down borders, King won't have to endure airplane food, forced photo-ops or guided walking tours any time soon.

But he still longs for a time when he could plan his dream vacation — then decide not to take it of his own accord.

""I don't need to go to Ireland,"" King said. ""But I don't like the fact that I can't.""

Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked protests in the city and calls to change the way police deal with people experiencing mental health crises.","TORONTO — Regis Korchinski-Paquet fell to her death while trying to sidestep onto a neighbour's balcony, said a report released Wednesday by Ontario's police watchdog, which concludes there are no grounds to charge officers who were in her home at the time.

The lengthy report from the Special Investigations Unit notes that Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked ""important conversations"" about the ways in which police interact with Black and Indigenous people, but says there was no evidence of police wrongdoing or ""overt"" racism in the incident itself.

article continues below

Director Joseph Martino said race may have been a factor in the events leading up to the death of the 29-year-old, who was both Indigenous and Black, but that examining systemic issues in policing is not his role.

""The task before me was a narrow one — namely, to determine whether there were reasonable grounds, on the evidence collected by the SIU, to believe that any one or more of the officers who responded to Ms. Korchinski-Paquet's apartment committed a criminal offence in connection with her death,"" he wrote.

The Special Investigations Unit said six officers were in the 29-year-old woman's Toronto home when she fell from the balcony in May, while her mother and brother were nearby.

The agency's report says Korchinski-Paquet's mother called police to the home because the two siblings were fighting — ""bottles and punches had been thrown"" — and she wanted both of them removed from the apartment.

It says Korchinski-Paquet and her brother also called 911 during the argument, which began as a dispute over the volume of the TV.

When the 911 operator asked about any mental health issues, the report says, the family indicated that Korchinski-Paquet had epilepsy and had had seizures earlier in the day.

It says that after police arrived, two officers blocked Korchinski-Paquet from getting to her mother and brother before allowing her back into the apartment so she could use the bathroom.

She then went out onto the 24th-floor balcony and prevented officers from joining her by holding her body against the door.

""Very quickly, Ms. Korchinski-Paquet scaled the balcony railing and the (subject officer) lost sight of her,"" the report reads.

She then tried to scale the balcony and cross onto the adjoining one, which is when she lost her balance and fell to her death, the report reads.

The agency said no officers were on the balcony with Korchinski-Paquet at the time, and there's no evidence the officers committed a crime.

Martino said that the officers seemed to be confused about whether epilepsy was a mental health condition and if they should or could detain Korchinski-Paquet under the Mental Health Act.

""The limited layperson's research I have conducted of the matter suggests that epilepsy is a neurological disorder with manifestations that can be mental as well as physical,"" Martino wrote. ""Be that as it may, I cannot fault the officers for failing to take Ms. Korchinski-Paquet into custody prior to her scaling the balcony railing. She had not given them any indication that she wished to harm herself and was professing to be the victim of an assault at the hands of her brother.""

He also said the officers tried to de-escalate the situation between Korchinski-Paquet's family.

The decision comes after the arm's-length agency interviewed all six officers, along with 15 civilian witnesses.

The agency said investigators also received a written statement from Korchinski-Paquet's father, with whom she had been speaking on the phone moments before her death.

Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked protests in the city and calls to change the way police deal with people experiencing mental health crises.

Martino noted that Korchinski-Paquet died just days after George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, was killed when an officer pressed a knee against his neck for nearly nine minutes, at a time when there was increased scrutiny over the relationship between police and racialized people.

In Toronto, thousands of protesters took to the streets on May 30, three days after the incident in Korchinski-Paquet's apartment. Several smaller marches followed it over the next several weeks.

Two city counsellors then brought forward a motion to defund Toronto police, but it was struck down in favour of introducing body-worn cameras to the force.

The Toronto Police Services Board, the body that oversees the force, then launched a series of town halls to discuss systemic racism in policing, though many protesters said such information-gathering had been done before to little effect.

Toronto police and Korchinski-Paquet’s family were expected to comment on the SIU report at separate news conferences later Wednesday.

Other speakers tonight include senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, who is leaving the White House at the end of the month, and Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn.

A devout Catholic, Pence and wife Karen are expected to carry the evangelical banner into Day 3 of the convention, touting Trump as the best choice for Americans who consider themselves social conservatives.

Democrats seized on the opportunity, deploying the openly gay Pete Buttigieg, one of Joe Biden's former presidential rivals, in a fundraising missive denouncing Pence's ""divisive, anti-LGBTQ politics"" and ""archaic worldview.""

As head of the White House coronavirus force, Pence is also likely to address an issue that has so far received relatively scant attention from convention speakers: the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Tuesday, economic adviser Larry Kudlow spoke of the crisis in the past tense, even though the pandemic continues to rage across the U.S., while only first lady Melania Trump expressed any empathy for the more than 178,000 Americans killed by the virus to date.

""My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one, and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering,"" she said. ""I know many people are anxious, and some feel helpless. I want you to know you are not alone.""

Kudlow, meanwhile, framed the novel coronavirus as ancient history in the U.S.

""It was awful — health and economic impacts were tragic, hardship and heartbreak were everywhere,"" Kudlow said. ""But presidential leadership came swiftly and effectively, with an extraordinary rescue for health and safety to successfully fight the COVID virus.""

Of the racial unrest roiling the country — fuelled this week by another police shooting of an unarmed Black man, this time in Wisconsin — Melania Trump urged protesters to channel their furious energy into positive change, not wanton destruction. She also resisted the urge to ""divide the country further"" by beating up on Democrats.

But she raised eyebrows by framing her husband, notorious for playing fast and loose with the truth, as an honest and authentic human being.

""Total honesty is what we as citizens deserve from our president,"" she said. ""Whether you like it or not, you always know what he's thinking.""

Trump has been putting the power of the presidency under a brazen partisan spotlight, and did so again Tuesday, pardoning a convicted bank robber who now helps prisoners reintegrate into society and presiding over a naturalization ceremony for five new American citizens. His wife's speech was delivered from the White House Rose Garden.

And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's pre-taped speech from a Jerusalem rooftop, coming in the middle of a diplomatic mission, did not escape the attention of some members of Congress. Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is accusing Pompeo of violating federal law by mixing government business with partisan interests.

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""","INVERMAY, Sask. — People could always tell when Aaron Ogden entered a room.

The 19-year-old had a big presence, said his father, Mark Ogden. He was a prankster, a one-of-a-kind character who would sit and talk to anybody as if he'd known them for years.

""He wasn't afraid to make friends,"" Ogden, 50, said in a phone interview. ""This is just the way he was.

""Really easy to talk to.""

People remembered the young man's outgoing personality at his funeral this week. He died in a Calgary hospital last Saturday after collapsing on a run.

His father, a trucker, was able to be by his son's side.

He said a major blood clot had formed around a stent placed in his son's aorta. The stent was necessary after he survived a serious highway accident on his way to work last year.

""It was a miracle, really.""

Ogden said while in hospital before his death, his son told him he was supposed to go for a CT scan in June while still living in Saskatchewan near Yorkton.

It was a routine checkup on the stent, but the appointment was postponed because of restrictions around the COVID-19 pandemic and never rescheduled.

""I didn't think nothing of it at the time, but I mulled it over ... as we watched him decline,"" Ogden said.

""It hit me. He was trying to tell me: 'This shouldn't have happened.'""

The father believes that had his son's scan not been cancelled, doctors might have found the blood clot in time.

Ogden wants all postponed hospital procedures done immediately.

""People's lives are being lost,"" he said. ""These COVID rules are way too far.""

Ogden believes the Saskatchewan Health Authority bears responsibility for his son's death.

""Somebody needs to be held to account.""

The health authority halted hundreds of non-urgent surgeries, procedures and diagnostics in March to brace for the pandemic.

Two months later, when the government felt it had a handle on the spread of the novel coronavirus, it announced the resumption of health services would be staggered.

""Emergency and urgent patients are the priority for services, including diagnostic imaging,"" said Corey Miller, vice-president of provincial programs at the health authority.

""The determination of the priority is based on the evaluation of the referring physician in consultation with the patient.""

Miller said they are reviewing Ogden's case and have reached out to his family.

He said the health authority is working through the backlog of exams that were delayed during the first few months of the pandemic.

More than 1,500 CT appointments which had been booked were postponed, he said.

Ogden questions why something like a CT scan couldn't be performed in Yorkton, where the risk of COVID-19 was low.

As of Friday, health officials reported five active cases in the region, which has only seen 33 infections in total since the pandemic hit Saskatchewan.

Cheryl Camillo, a professor with the University of Regina's Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy, says speaking generally, delaying non-essential services to respond to COVID-19 was the responsible thing to do because the virus was new and spreading quickly.

""The risks are that some people don't get the essential and urgent services because so much of the workforce and the resources of the health system move towards responding to COVID,"" said the health systems researcher.

""It's very human for people to get frustrated because health care is something that is so personal.""

She says another risk of scaling back is that people can lose confidence in a health system some may perceive as having overplanned for the pandemic.

Health officials are in the tough spot of having to prepare for the worst case scenario and what could be a rapid change in case numbers, she says.

During the pandemic Camillo's own grandmother died in a long-term care home in the United States from isolation and depression, she says.

""I suffered an individual loss of my otherwise pretty healthy grandmother, but despite how profoundly sad that makes me, I understand and would defend the care home's decision to lock down.

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""

“That’s a lot of money — more than we can afford, basically,” Jennifer said in an interview from the Cayman Islands on Tuesday.
On top of the foreign buyer tax, there is B.C.’s speculation and vacancy tax of two per cent, plus the usual costs associated with a property purchase, such as lawyers fees.
Born in the Cayman Islands, the Dilberts attended university in eastern Canada.
Jennifer suggests that people in their position could be grandfathered in some way so that they are not required to pay the foreign buyer tax.","A retired Cayman Islands couple is under contract to buy a Victoria condo this fall, but when that happens they will also have to pay $120,000 in foreign buyer tax for a brand-new unit that they can’t visit because borders are closed due to the pandemic.

Jennifer and Leonard say they are stuck in a situation they never expected.

article continues below

They signed a pre-sale agreement in June 2017 to buy a condo for $600,000 in the Wade development in the 1100 block of Pandora Avenue. They put down $90,000 as a deposit.

They were surprised in 2018 when B.C. announced that a foreign buyer tax of 20 per cent of the market value of a home would be applied in Greater Victoria.

That means once the sale closes and the Dilberts receive legal title to their fourth-floor unit, they will owe an additional $120,000 to the province.

“That’s a lot of money — more than we can afford, basically,” Jennifer said in an interview from the Cayman Islands on Tuesday.

Leonard said: “It is a very difficult situation to be in. We have a limited income stream.”

The Dilberts are retired civil servants receiving pensions, living in the West Bay District of Cayman Islands in the Western Caribbean.

On top of the foreign buyer tax, there is B.C.’s speculation and vacancy tax of two per cent, plus the usual costs associated with a property purchase, such as lawyers fees.

The other concern is that the ability to travel between countries has changed now and possibly long into the future. The couple has no idea when travel may be feasible again.

Born in the Cayman Islands, the Dilberts attended university in eastern Canada. In 1999, they bought a house in the North Quadra area when their daughters were teen­agers.

Jennifer took work in London for a time. While there, she was made a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for public service in the Caymans. She received the honour from the Queen at Buckingham Palace.

The Dilberts eventually sold their Saanich home and invested in the Wade development. They were attracted by its low-rise profile, environmentally friendly features, such as extensive gardens, and proximity to downtown.

Leonard writes contemporary poetry and enjoyed the artistic culture of Victoria, often reading his work at the Mocambo Cafe’s open-mike sessions. They loved attending lectures at UVic, shopping and going to restaurants downtown.

“The place is a part of us,” he said.

He said they especially love the West Coast and describes Victoria as the “best of all worlds.”

“This is not about us speculating in the market,” Leonard said. “The whole thing is heartbreaking to me.” They were most recently in Victoria in October of last year and expect the condo to be finished in a month or so.

The Dilberts’ plan was to retain their home in the Cayman Islands where their elderly parents and grandchildren live and also visit friends and spend time in Victoria.

They were most recently in the capital region in October 2019.

But now, they have their unit on the market, hoping to sell the agreement to purchase the two bedroom and den condominium prior to taking title, in order to avoid the foreign buyer’s tax. The unit is for sale at $649,000.

Jennifer suggests that people in their position could be grandfathered in some way so that they are not required to pay the foreign buyer tax.

Brett Jones, real estate agent for the Dilberts, said: “I think during COVID, the foreign buyer tax should be suspended for people to close on their property for the purpose of reselling it.”

He’s not calling for an exemption so that buyers can use a home because that would defeat the purpose of it — the government brought it in to create more affordable housing for British Columbians.

“But it is penalizing people that planned on purchasing these properties and then won’t be able to use them, tax not withstanding, and it’s not really fair to pay and not be able to use it.”

Jones suggests allowing people in this situation to get a refund on the foreign buyer tax if a property is sold within six months or one year of closing.

B.C.’s Ministry of Finance does not comment on individual circumstances but said in a statement that people can contact it to discuss options regarding the speculation and vacancy tax.

There is a provision for exemptions for circumstances such as extended absence, divorce, home renovations and hospitalization.

Andrew Lees, who owns Five Star Whale Watching, brought his guests to the south side of Sidney Island, where they watched a killer whale mom and her son play in kelp beds.

Lees said the mature son was more active than his mom, known as T10. The group watched the son slap his tail and move back and forth in the kelp.

“We noticed he turned upside down and all of a sudden I saw the tail fly up and I saw the seal mid-air,” Lees said.

Lees said the guests could tell by his expression that it was a special sight. He didn’t know he had cap­tured the “breathtaking moment” until he got home and checked his camera. He was trying to steer the boat at the time and just happened to be pointing the camera in the whales’ direction when the orca put on a show.

Lees has been leading whale watching trips since 2005 and said this was a rare sight. He’s seen a whale toss a porpoise or a seal with its tail just a handful of times in 15 years on the water. More often, he sees orcas throw prey up using their mouths.

“It was the height that the seal caught that particular day and the way the male had gone on his back to do it,” Lees said. “It’s not often we see them doing it with the tail like that. It happens but, you know, that’s definitely one of those rarer activities we see out there.”

The mom and son appeared to finish the seal off underwater, which Lees said is pretty common after starting an attack at the surface.

Sometimes he can tell the whales have got their prey even when they dip below the surface, because there’s an oily sheen on the water and a whiff of what smells like sweet cucumber from the oils of the seal.

While a rare sight to witness, the behaviour is not uncommon for Bigg’s killer whales, said Jackie Hildering, an education director at the Marine Education and Research Society in Port McNeill.

The orcas will often put on dramatic displays with prey when socializing, learning or playing, she said, and may not even eat the animal.

Tossing a seal might be a particular whale’s hunting style to disable the animal,

but it’s not essential to kill a seal, which is easy prey for Bigg’s killer whales, Hildering said.

“It’s usually younger members of the population will do things like hit birds with their tails at the surface, little diving birds, and then suck them in as well as spit them back out” or carry around a piece of seal for a while, she said.

Bigg’s killer whales are “extraordinarily social” animals, and the behaviours are linked to learning and play. Younger whales can hone their hunting skills by learning to hit prey with accuracy and manipulate small pieces of prey, Hildering said.

In the case of Lees’ photo, Hildering said the whales were likely playing with the seal or trying to disable it by tossing it in the air.

She said the Bigg’s killer whales are sometimes vilified for behaviour that some people see as cruel, like playing with prey, and said it’s important to remember that the behaviour has purposes.

“There is no good or bad in nature. There’s just wild, and so this should have no judgment to it, because that ends up pushing the idea that these are somehow bad whales, which has made us make horrible mistakes in the past,” Hildering said.

As top level predators, Bigg’s killer whales shape the populations of species below them in the food chain. Their habitat extends from Alaska to southern California, and they’re found along the B.C. coast year-round.

Bigg’s killer whales, also known as transient killer whales, are named in honour of the late researcher Dr. Michael Bigg whose research led to the understanding that there are multiple populations of killer whales in B.C.

“If I pass 80 I’m going to call it Nudging 90.”kderosa@timescolonist.com","Anne Patton, 78, has done more things in the last year than most people have done in a lifetime. She endured -40C temperatures while dog sledding in Churchill, Man., trudged through waist-deep snow while snowshoeing, zoomed across a zip line and glided across — and fell into — a calm lake while stand-up paddle boarding.

Her list of adventures will unfold over the next two years as the Saanich-based children’s author aims to do 80 new things before she turns 80. Her personal project, dubbed “Embracing Eighty” and chronicled on her Facebook page, is about getting the most out of life and staying young at heart.

“I figure that as long as you’re living on this earth, you should be alive,” said Patton, who moved to Victoria with her husband in 2011 after a long career as an elementary school teacher in Regina. “My idea as a teacher was to instill passion for life. I want to be an example of living in the moment and enjoying the moment.”

Patton was inspired by a fellow writer who was trying 60 new things before she turned 60. Patton started last year just after her 77th birthday. “I thought to myself: ‘If I’m doing 80 things, I better start now.’ “

Many of the activities are done with her grandsons Seamus, 12, and Jasper, 10, who have watched her pull crabs from a crab trap, float in the ocean on a giant swan and traverse a metal tight rope and rope ladders while harnessed high up in the trees at the aerial adventure park Wild Play.

Patton doesn’t have a set list of 80 things, she’s just embracing experiences as they come to her. And she’s open to suggestions.

Some of her plans, for example taking a hot air balloon ride or going on a Segway tour, have been scuttled because of COVID-19 travel restrictions.

“I was planning to go to Scotland, you know, have some far out adventures, but I’m stuck here on the Island,” she joked. Nonetheless, new adventures seem to find her, often unexpectedly. During a family trip to Cowichan Bay in July, Patton told the on-site manager of her rented beach house that she was running out of ideas for her project.

His first suggestions — skydiving and bungy — were quickly shot down by Patton, who says she has her limits.

“He said, ‘oh, well how about a Harley Davidson ride?’ Well, that sounded so tame in comparison to skydiving that I said ‘oh sure.’ “

Patton worried she didn’t have “any of the right clothes to look bad ass.”

The man’s wife stepped in and outfitted Patton in black leather boots, a black motorcycle jacket and black helmet. “I looked like Darth Vader and sounded like him too.”

Patton jumped on the back of the Harley and was whisked away to Bowser and back. She pitched the idea of carrying on to Port Hardy but her escort had to get back to work.

Patton’s friends told her she was crazy when she said she wanted to go to Churchill, Man. in early March. Undeterred, she ticked off at least six adventures up there, including snowshoeing, dog sledding, and visiting Sloop Cove where 18th century Hudson’s Bay fur traders etched their names into some of the Earth’s oldest bedrock. There, she describes giant ice ridges pushed up by the tide “like grotesque sea monsters trying to crawl out from under the water.”

That sheltered nook on the west side of the Churchill River will be one of the settings in Patton’s upcoming young adult novel about the forced evictions of people living in the Scottish Highlands, called the Highland Clearances, beginning in the mid-18th century.

Patton said her spontaneity and try-it-all-once attitude keep her young and close to her five grandchildren, aged 12 to 21.

“They’re young, spunky people. I don’t want to look like an old fogey. I want to be someone they remember fondly.”

Patton hopes that after she dies, her grandkids will laugh as they share memories and say: “Remember how crazy Nana was?”

Patton turns 80 on March 1, 2022. She’s not worried if she doesn’t find 80 things by then.

She figures she’ll have to keep going anyways because she wants to see the solar eclipse which is set for October 2023. “If I pass 80 I’m going to call it Nudging 90.”

Her story goes back to 1989, when the then 14-year-old found herself on Vancouver’s Granville Street after fleeing traumatizing violence.
The streets were full of such kids, gravitating to their own sub-cultures: criminals, punks, goths, racist skinheads, non-racist skinheads….
There were high school kids, business guys in Armani suits.
McMurter got into program in which street kids got restaurant training while working at a cafe.","Somewhere between the two extremes — those who want to hug all the messed-up people on the street, and those who would happily hose them into the Inner Harbour — stands Sue McMurter.

On one hand, she is solidly for law and order. She has little patience for the ivory tower lefties on city council, the ones whose view of street life is filtered by ideology, the cop-bashers who don’t understand what the police really do. She is tired of the discarded needles in her Burnside-Gorge neighbourhood, of the stranger’s hand rattling her door at 4 a.m.

article continues below

On the other, she calls the conversion of area hotels into temporary housing “a good start.” And long before the province announced $36 million for youth treatment centres this week, McMurter was passionately arguing the urgent need for such facilities, particularly here on Vancouver Island, where none exist. She has nothing but sympathy for people like the young woman she found living in a tent the other day, unaware of the help available to her.

For McMurter, 45, has a rare perspective: Three decades ago, she was a street-entrenched runaway. And she knows that if you want to paint a picture of an individual, you can’t use a broad brush.

Her story goes back to 1989, when the then 14-year-old found herself on Vancouver’s Granville Street after fleeing traumatizing violence. She survived by couch-surfing, panhandling, living in squats with other broken, bullied teens. The streets were full of such kids, gravitating to their own sub-cultures: criminals, punks, goths, racist skinheads, non-racist skinheads….

Knowing that she needed an education, she bounced around a series of schools, where no one paid attention to the honour roll student who would be there for awhile, then be gone.

At 15 she asked about getting government help, but because her family home was in the Fraser Valley she was sent to a welfare office in Aldergrove, where a social worker basically told her to stop whining and go away. Great. Already feeling like she didn’t matter, she had it confirmed by officialdom. “The world’s telling me I’m a complete piece of shit.”

So she stayed on the streets where, because she wasn’t crossing paths with the police or creating problems in school, she was effectively invisible. No one saw that she was anxious and depressed. No one paid attention to the drinking and the drugs.

She avoided some of the traps, though. “Pimps are looking at me and I’m, like, ‘I know what you’re after. Go away.’” She scrambled for jobs where she could find them, even working at a high-end south Granville salon until customers complained she was too young.

It wasn’t until she was 16 and starving that a friend dragged her to the provincial government’s adolescent services unit in search of meal vouchers to a local restaurant. “Where have you been all this time?” asked the man in charge. “I came in here before and you guys sent me away,” she replied.

After that, McMurter was taken into government care, which first meant a room in an infamous flophouse, then — thankfully — a spot in a group home for girls run by a wonderful woman named Lenox who provided structure and, more importantly, caring. McMurter went to alternative school, where she thrived. “I didn’t have the obstacles the other kids had.”

In fact she did so well that she outgrew the group home — which proved to be her downfall. Deemed strong and competent enough to live unsupported, she moved out on her own at age 18. Without the structure provided by Lenox, it was a disaster. She found herself surrounded by addicts. It was 1993, the year the China White heroin wave broke over Vancouver. “B.C. Ambulance personnel were having nervous breakdowns. They were hauling bodies out of dumpsters.” It wasn’t only the street addicts who were dying. There were high school kids, business guys in Armani suits.

“It was not just the Downtown Eastside. The ugliness was absolutely everywhere, and there was a gang turf war exploding.”

Then, far away in Ontario, her grandmother died. “That was a massive hit to me, losing her. My grandma was the one person in the world who loved me, and she was gone.” McMurter was closing in on her 19th birthday, which in those days meant aging out of government care, falling off a cliff. She was scared.

“My whole peer group was going downhill with all the heroin that’s around,” she said. She found herself alone in an East Van slum, no job, no school, nothing. “I felt completely abandoned by the people who were supposed to be taking care of me.”

Back then, when youth in care turned 19 they would get shuttled down the street to the adult welfare office, assigned to a formidable woman who would admonish them to get a job. Blunt advice, but the alternative was the treadmill in which the ambulance sirens began as soon as the welfare cheques were cashed.

McMurter got into program in which street kids got restaurant training while working at a cafe. That went well until her anxiety caught up to her and, instead of helping her work through it, her government-funded employer dumped her. What made things worse was that the job had made her ineligible for social assistance, so, unable to pay her rent, she found herself on the street again. “Thanks, guys.”

She drifted to Denman Island where, while working in a restaurant and living in a tent, she turned 20. Then came a similar job in Invermere, then other towns. She was still self-medicating, but the more she distanced herself from her old life in Vancouver, the more she met new kinds of people, saw more possibilities.

She was 23 and living in Calgary when she got clean.

What was the catalyst? “Just knowing that that there’s more to the world, and being smart enough to know I didn’t want to die in a gutter…. Knowing I was capable of being more than that.”

She focussed on gaining the life she wanted, not quitting the one she wanted to leave. It worked. “I’m someone who came out the other side.”

So now she is married and has a government job — and the perspective that comes with lived experience. The latter allows her to eschew that broad brush being applied to both campers and the used-to-be homeless now living in temporary housing. The actions of some shouldn’t leave them all branded as criminals. Nor are they all little lost lambs.

“The little lost lamb talk has to go away,” she says. Social justice warriors can’t excuse anti-social behaviour. “You can be compassionate and have boundaries at the same time. You can take care of people without letting them burn down your house.”

But you do need to take care of people, which means that it’s not good enough to offer harm-reduction strategies that aren’t accompanied by treatment. “Sure it gives them clean supplies, but where’s the incentive to stop?” So, yes, those youth-treatment beds are desperately needed. So are treatment beds in general. People in need matter, even when made to feel that they don’t.

Their latest findings, however, have cast those earlier discoveries in a more sobering light.

In the first published study coming out of the expeditions, the scientists report that many of the newly observed species might already be on the way out.

“What we have found is evidence of climate change in the deep sea,” said Cherisse Du Preez, a marine biologist with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and a member of the seamount expeditions in 2018 and 2019.

“It isn’t what we were looking for when we went out there. We went out there to catalogue the life. But what we found is that ocean acidification is rising, the oxygen is dropping.

“We have a 60-year time series that shows that this is significant and we’re finding this is having an impact on the animals that we’ve just newly discovered are down there.”

Du Preez and fellow scientists Tetjana Ross and Debby Ianson report that local extinctions in the deep sea will become common within a few decades if the trend persists.

“We were surprised that the changes were happening as rapidly as they were that deep in the ocean, because this sort of signal we expect to be communicated closer to the surface,” said Ianson, a biogeochemical oceanographer with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.

Ianson and Du Preez both said they hope the paper sounds an alarm.

“What we want to do is warn people that now’s the time to mitigate every direct human impact that we can, because we have to buffer these animals from what’s about to happen to them,” Du Preez said.

In that sense, she said, their research underlines the importance of work being done by the Canadian government and First Nations along the coast to create large marine protected areas to shield creature from seabed mining and harmful fishing practices.

The Explorer Seamount, for example, an underwater volcano that rises 2.5 kilometres from the ocean floor and rivals Mount Baker in height, sits at the centre of 133,000 square kilometres of ocean that Canada declared an Offshore Pacific Area of Interest in 2017.

At the time, the federal government said it intended to make the region one of Canada’s largest Marine Protected Areas by 2020.

Ianson said Canadians can only do so much to reduce the worldwide emissions that are causing the planet to warm.

“You know, that part is something that’s a global problem,” she said. “But what we can do is actually say, ‘Hey, we’re not going to put more stress on these creatures. We’re not going to fish them. We’re not going to allow deep-sea mining or things like that.’

“In a way, that’s the feel-good story because we can do something about this,” she said. “And hopefully people realize that climate change is progressing a little more rapidly than many things can adapt.”

Du Preez admitted that it’s been gut-wrenching for scientists to find so many new species in recent years only to learn that many of them are facing extinction.

“You have no idea,” she said. “It’s very strange, because we’re working with taxonomists to identify these animals, to name them.

“So we’re discussing these animals that are brand new to science, and we’re explaining how it is that they may no longer be around very long. That’s very sobering.

“But nature’s a remarkable thing and if we can just give them a wide berth and buffer for these impacts, they stand a better chance.”

Some perfectly harmless — though somewhat menacing-looking — insects are being mistaken for the Asian giant hornet, said Paul van Westendorp, an apiculturist with the provincial government. He’s the point person on the team tasked with flushing out and destroying any so-called murder hornets, an invasive species first discovered in Nanaimo last summer.

A photo taken Wednesday in Fernwood by Noah Williams was identified by van Westendorp as a horntail wasp — an intriguing sight indeed, but no murder hornet.

“The bug is a horntail. Native, solitary and completely harmless,” said van Westendorp. “They [usually] occupy forest habitat with cut timber. The posterior includes an ovipositor used to lay eggs.

“Pretty intimidating insect, but not of any concern.”

Williams said the horntail wasp landed in a bucket of water and was drowning. He couldn’t believe the size of the insect, saying it was as long as a cigarette lighter.

Other insects often mistaken for the Asian giant hornet are the bald-faced hornet, yellow jacket and elm sawfly, all native to B.C., said van Westendorp.

Versions of some have been around a long time in B.C.

Bruce Archibald, a paleoentomologist with the Royal B.C. Museum and Simon Fraser University, discovered a fossilized giant horntail wood wasp during a dig near Cache Creek in 2015.

The 53-million-year-old species, which he dubbed Ypresiosirex orthosemos, was about seven centimetres in length, which is slightly larger than its modern descendants of about 2.5 centimetres.

Although they look like stingers, horntail wasps don’t have the ability to sting or bite. Females have a long, horn-like tail used to deposit eggs. Their harm is the damage the larvae can do to trees and wood in your home where they usually lay eggs.

The elm sawfly is another one mistaken for the Asian giant hornet.

The sawfly is intimidating at 2.5 centimetres in length, but they also lack a stinger and are considered harmless to humans, says Pest Control Canada. Sawflies also have ovipositor to lay eggs and have strong jaws, but use them to strip bark from trees to reach sap for food.

The elm sawfly is prevalent across North America.

The bald-faced hornet, a type of yellow jacket but coloured white and black, is a more aggressive insect. It’s also big and it packs a powerful sting when its nests are threatened.

It is strictly a predator, usually feeding on other insects, although Claudia Copley, an entomologist from the Royal B.C. Museum, told the Times Colonist last year she once saw a bald-faced hornet sting a young toad to death and carry it off.

Yellow jackets are very common, annoying at picnics and feared for their painful stings which can cause allergic reactions, but the province considers them useful in the ecosystem as they prey on flies, caterpillars and other insects.

The Asian giant hornet is usually found in eastern and southeast Asia. It got the murder hornet moniker from Japan, where there have been several documented deaths due to multiple stings.

There have only been a handful of specimens collected since a nest was discovered near Nanaimo a year ago.

Canadian and U.S. officials are co-operating to locate and destroy any new infestations with baited traps along the B.C.-Washington border.

An Asian giant hornet was discovered last November in White Rock and two specimens were found in December at Blaine, Washington.

An Asian giant hornet was collected near Langley in May. Another was taken on July 14 near Birch Bay, south of Blaine.

Sightings in the Cowichan Valley prompted the province to deploy jar traps last month in hopes of narrowing a search for a possible nest.

It’s unclear how the Asian giant hornet arrived in North America, but it is likely they hitched rides in container ships.

The species present a dire risk to honeybee populations in British Columbia, and can quickly destroy hives.

Loblaw Companies Ltd., which began offering COVID-19 testing for patients at a handful of its Alberta pharmacy locations in June, plans to expand the program to all 234 of its pharmacies in the province by Sept. 1.

The company says it has reached out to all 10 provinces to discuss in-store testing outside Alberta, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford this week acknowledging the possibility.

The swab tests are only for those with no symptoms or any known contact with coronavirus patients and may be useful for teachers returning to school or Canadians who take care of an older family member, said Theresa Firestone, head of health and wellness at Shoppers Drug Mart. Loblaw-owned pharmacy locations include Shoppers stores as well as Independent Foods and No Frills.

""It's very convenient. We're in every community. The other plus is they don't have to line up with people who may have symptoms. We've shared that with Ontario and with other provinces, so at this point we’re looking forward to what they may decide,"" Firestone said.

London Drugs also conducts COVID-19 tests in Alberta. It began offering the service at six locations during the past two weeks and plans to roll it out at nine more by October. Like Shoppers, it bills Alberta Health Services for testing costs.

The service builds on other responses to the pandemic such as online pharmacist consultations and a pilot program where patients consult virtually with doctors in a private room in the store.

London Drugs is among the pharmacy retailers beefing up their role in a health-care system grappling with an aging population.

""With the extended hours of operation, you can basically go in when our stores are open and be able to find a pharmacist to ask a question. So what we’re able to do at that point is basically help triage the system,"" said Chris Chiew, head of pharmacy at the Richmond, B.C.-based retailer.

London Drugs has also hired diabetes educators to test blood sugar levels and assist patients with weight management and diet.

Shoppers has stepped even further into the realm of physicians, opening one of three planned medical clinics with doctors who cater to a roster of patients and walk-in services.

""There are a number of Canadians who don’t have access to a family physician. And we thought there was an opportunity for us to really play a role here in terms of access,"" Firestone said.

Drugstores can also handle the bureaucratic side of health care, freeing up doctors to spend more time with patients, she said.

""Looking for PPE (personal protective equipment), sorting out their waiting rooms so that people are socially distanced, managing virtual care...we’re able to take that burden on for them,"" Firestone said.

In 2018, Shoppers launched its Wellwise store chain to sell assisted-living devices aimed at older Canadians. More recently, it began to offer tips and videos online designed to help ward off depression and anxiety.

Metro Inc. declined to comment on any attempts to provide COVID-19 testing. The bulk of the company's Jean Coutu drugstores are located in Quebec, which unlike some provinces does not allow pharmacists to conduct testing via nose and mouth swabs.

Patrick Cronin, the bank's chief risk officer, attributed the high provisions to the COVID-19 pandemic, but said he has confidence in the bank's ability to operate in such an environment.

The Canadian Association of Broadcasters issued a report on Wednesday warning of potential closures and widespread job cuts as private TV and radio broadcasters face a cumulative projected revenue shortfall of up to $1.06 billion by the end of 2022.

Most vulnerable are the country's AM radio stations, the report said, as well as other independent private radio and TV operations in smaller markets across the country.

The study, titled ""The Crisis in Canadian Media and the Future of Local Broadcasting,"" was commissioned by the CAB, which represents the majority of private broadcasters in Canada, and conducted through Winnipeg-based independent media economics consultancy Communications Management Inc.

The CAB says it's concerned about the fallout from a substantial erosion in local advertising revenues over recent months.

Radio stations may be hardest hit in the short term, the report suggests, partly due to many advertisers pulling back on their spending in the pandemic and hastening a decline in the media industry's revenues.

Private radio ad revenues are expected to be $383 million below last year, it said.

The report's projections suggest that without further government support those declines could mean as many as 50 private local radio stations go out of business over the next four to six months.

The CAB is calling on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to take swift action by establishing a ""more fair and sustainable future"" for local media.

Last month, the organization sent an emergency application to the CRTC requesting permission for broadcasters to be relieved of certain terms of their agreements, such as spending requirements on Canadian programming, for the broadcast year that ends Aug. 31.

Lenore Gibson, chair of the CAB, said broadcasters have ""done their utmost to cut expenses"" in areas such as administration, and ""the last thing that they want to do is cut into programming costs, but that's the only area that's left now.""

The CAB is urging the federal government to provide emergency regulatory relief as well as greater ""targeted support"" for the industry starting this fall.

Without greater financial measures in place, the CAB says the effects could leave many communities with only national and international media organizations to provide them with most of their news, effectively eliminating most community coverage of local politics, health and education in some regions of the country.

Bo Horvat scored twice, and Tyler Toffoli and Elias Pettersson each had a goal and two assists as the Canucks defeated the Golden Knights 5-2 at Rogers Place.

article continues below

The best-of-seven second-round series is tied 1-1. Game 3 goes Thursday.

Forty-eight hours earlier, the Golden Knights, now 8-2 in the post-season, had manhandled the Canucks en route to a 5-0 pounding in Game 1.

""For us as a team we wanted to bounce back from Game 1. We weren't happy with that,"" said Pettersson.

""We played a good game. We should be happy about it but (we need) a short-term memory and be ready for Game 3.""

Goaltender Jacob Markstrom made 38 saves for the win while Robin Lehner stopped 22 shots for Vegas. It's the first time Vegas has allowed more than five goals in a game in the return-to-play tournament.

It was the first game back for Toffoli since the opening game of the qualifying round against the Minnesota Wild on Aug. 2. The NHL is not releasing information on injuries, but Toffoli had been seen in a walking boot.

Toffoli jumped over the boards for his first shift in the first period and scored nine seconds later, taking a cross-crease pass from Pettersson to put the puck into a yawning net. He then made it 2-0 on the power play, delivering a tape-to-tape pass to an incoming Horvat, who blasted it past Lehner.

""It's fun to get back in the lineup and get a big win and tie this series up,"" said Toffoli, who had been acquired at the trade deadline from the Los Angeles Kings. He had put up 10 points in his first 10 games with the Canucks before the regular season ended March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I made some phone calls yesterday, talked to a lot of people. It was a busy day,"" said Toffoli. ""It was good obviously getting the OK from everybody (to play). I got all excited. Felt like I was coming back to my first playoff series.""

Vancouver coach Travis Green said the 5-0 loss was their worst game of the playoffs and that Game 2 was a must-win.

""You go down two (games) against that team early in the series it would be tough and just mentally, too (to come back),"" he said.

""We were better with the puck, played a more direct game. I thought we were better on our feet, quicker. That's a good hockey team. I thought we did a good job of making them defend more than we did the first game.""

Despite being down by two goals in the second period, the Golden Knights looked like they were going to run the Canucks out of the rink again.

Markstrom kept the Canucks alive as Vegas tilted the ice and turned his net into a shooting gallery, blasting away for 22 shots in the period. Vegas got one goal back from Alex Tuch before Pettersson scored on a cross-ice feed from Alex Edler to make it 3-1 heading into the third.

""That really was a back-breaker,"" said Vegas head coach Peter DeBoer. ""You're down 3-1 and you have nothing to show for the work you put in to try and get back in the game.""

Tuch added: ""We knew Vancouver wasn't happy with the way they played last game and we knew they were going to come out flying. And we decided instead of being prepared, (to) be surprised by that for some reason.""

Vancouver iced the game 18 seconds into the third on Horvat's second goal. Then the frustration finally got to Vegas.

First, Max Pacioretty grabbed J.T. Miller by the head and threw him down after the whistle for a roughing penalty. Tuch got a double minor for pummelling Jake Virtanen while the Vancouver forward lay on the ice.

Pacioretty scored late for Vegas and Tanner Pearson added the final Vancouver goal into an empty net.

Horvat had not found the scoresheet since scoring two goals in each of the first two games against the St. Louis Blues in the first round.

Pettersson has been a steady point-getter throughout the playoffs but had been shut down by Vegas in Game 1, limited to no shots on net and one blocked shot.

Markstrom, in his first playoff series, has been the locomotive pulling the Canucks' playoff train. He allowed just nine goals on 121 shots (.926 save percentage) against Minnesota in the first round while registering his first playoff shutout. He saved 29 of 34 against the Blues (.930).

The series is being played at a fan-less Rogers Place. Players are isolating between contests to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This was Williams’ fifth match since professional tennis resumed amid the coronavirus pandemic after a hiatus of nearly six months — and all five have gone three sets. She is 3-2 in that stretch.

The result against No. 13 seed Sakkari, and particularly the way the match ended, was hardly promising for Williams as the U.S. Open’s start approaches next week.

The Western & Southern Open is usually held in Ohio but was moved to the U.S. Open’s site in Flushing Meadows this year to make for a two-event, no-spectator ""bubble"" during the pandemic.

In men's play, Canada's Milos Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Andy Murray. Raonic, from Thornhill, Ont., is the last Canadian remaining in the draw.

Williams was seemingly in control early, serving for the first set at 5-3, 30-0, when things began to unravel. She missed two backhands in a row, then put a forehand into the net to set up a break point, and walked over to the stand holding her towel at the back of the court (the ball people normally handle towels for players, but not during COVID-19).

That’s when chair umpire Aurelie Tourte called a time violation. On the following point, Williams sailed a forehand long to get broken.

At the ensuing changeover, the 23-time Grand Slam champion argued with Tourte, saying: ""I mean, I’m getting my own towels. That’s not fair. You should tell me on the sidelines next time if I need to play faster. Believe me, I will. ... You didn't even give me a warning.""

While Williams eventually did grab that set, she again frittered away a 5-3 lead in the second, plus a 4-1 edge in the tiebreaker. When she sat after the second set, the 38-year-old American tossed her racket over her shoulder the way an office worker might flip a crumpled piece of paper toward a trash can.

Williams came out flat in the third set, as if she’d rather be anywhere else. She double-faulted four times in the second game, including on Sakkari’s eighth break chance, to make it 2-0 and that was pretty much that.

Hours earlier, Novak Djokovic’s neck felt much better, and his tennis looked much better, in a 6-2, 6-4 victory over unseeded American Tennys Sandgren that improved the No. 1-ranked man to 20-0 in 2020.

""Actually, I’m pleasantly surprised with the way I recovered and felt today — just overall, physically, but also with the neck, specifically, because that was a little bit of a concern,"" said Djokovic, who will be eyeing his 18th Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open. ""Going back four, five days, I did struggle quite a lot.""

Djokovic was treated by a trainer and played sluggishly in his opening match Monday, but he was at his best from the outset against Sandgren and saved all four break points he faced.

Djokovic will face 34th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff in the quarterfinals. The other quarterfinal in the top half of the draw will be defending champion Daniil Medvedev against No. 8 seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Reilly Opelka, a 6-foot-11 American who is ranked 39th, delivered 19 aces and knocked off 2019 U.S. Open semifinalist Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 7-6 (4). Opelka next meets No. 4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, whose 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4) win over No. 16 John Isner was interrupted by a rain delay of nearly 1 1/2 hours late in the first set.

Also interrupted by the weather was Raonic's victory over the three-time Grand Slam champion. Raonic, a Wimbledon runner-up in 2016, has held all 29 games he’s served so far in the tournament.

""I have done the work,"" Raonic said. ""I have put in the effort, and I'm just happy that this quickly the pieces are coming together.""

This was Murray's first tournament appearance since November. He missed time due to a pelvic injury and is playing on a metal hip after two operations on that joint.

""Didn’t play well. It was not a good day,"" Murray said. ""The positives are that I got three matches in. Physically, I pulled up OK.""

Women’s quarterfinal matchups set earlier in the day were two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka against Anett Kontaveit, former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka against Ons Jabeur, and 83rd-ranked American qualifier Jessica Pegula against No. 14 Elise Mertens.

He was 5 under after the front nine Tuesday at Ozarks National when he hit driver at the par-4 10th. The ball wound up in such heavy rough that Mickelson couldn't find it, forcing him to take a penalty stroke. He still wound up making a long putt to salvage bogey, and that gave him some momentum for the rest of the round.

""I was able to get right back to even par on the back side with a birdie on the next hole, and then I made a couple more coming in,"" said Mickelson, whose 7-under 64 left him 17 under.

That was good for a four-shot lead over Tim Petrovic and Rod Pampling, who will be his playing partners for the final round. Mike Weir of Bright's Grove, Ont., (69) was nine shots off the lead at 8 under.

""I've been putting really well,"" Mickelson said. ""Today I didn't drive it the way I've been driving it. I kind of a hung a few drives, so I'm going to the range and try to work on that now. But when I come out tomorrow I'll try to be a little bit more aggressive with the driver and see if I can make a few more birdies.""

A few more? He's already made 19 of them in his first 36 holes.

Playing in the final group and with the shadows getting long, Mickelson picked up right where he left off after his opening-round 61. He made birdie at the third and then rattled off three straight beginning at the par-4 fifth, where he nearly chipped in for eagle.

Petrovic tried to make a run at Mickelson, but even one of his career-low rounds only got him so close. His putter went cold down the stretch and a poor approach at the par-4 finishing hole resulted in bogey.

Mickelson added a bridie at the ninth, the only hole he bogeyed on Monday, after a pretty flop shot over the bunker. After the lost ball at the 10th, Mickelson responded by adding two more birdies.

The second of them at the par-3 12th was a backhanded tap-in. His approach shot barely carried onto the front edge of the green, then nestled up to about an inch from the hole.

Mickelson could still squander the lead in the final round Wednesday, when tee times were moved to the early morning because of expected bad weather in the afternoon. But given the quality of his short game through 36 holes, the more pressing question is whether he could break the PGA Tour Champions' 54-hole scoring record of 191 — shared by Bruce Fleisher, Loren Roberts, Bernhard Langer, David Frost and Rocco Mediate.

Mickelson, who decided to make his debut on the over-50 tour to continue his U.S. Open prep after he was eliminated from the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, would need to shoot 65 in his final round Wednesday to move atop the list.

Petrovic and Pampling each shot 64-65 over the first two rounds. Rocco Mediate struggled coming in and was at 12 under.

K.J. Choi was another shot back, and Steve Stricker and David McKenzie were at 10 under.

Moments later, the Chicago White Sox right-hander threw the final pitch in a truly bizarre performance.

A no-fan no-no.

With the seats at Guaranteed Rate Field empty, Giolito pitched the first no-hitter of the pandemic-delayed season, striking out 13 in leading the White Sox over the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 Tuesday night.

""2020 has been a very strange year,"" said Giolito, who conducted a postgame interview while wearing a mask. ""Obviously a lot of weird stuff going on with COVID and the state of the world, so may as well throw this in the mix.""

Sounds like he didn't mind that nobody saw it. Well, almost no one.

After right fielder Adam Engel extended on the run to catch Erik Gonzalez’s slicing drive toward the line for the final out, the hollers of Giolito’s teammates in the middle of the diamond echoed around the stadium.

""I’m just stoked for Lucas and so happy and ecstatic and emotional for Lucas,"" Engel said. ""It stinks we couldn’t celebrate the way most no-hitters get celebrated.""

The smallest crowd listed for any no-hitter in the majors over the last 100 years came in 1944, when a mere 1,014 watched Cincinnati’s Clyde Shoun beat the Braves at Crosley Field.

Nowhere close to that number on this night, not with the park that holds over 40,000 closed to fans because of virus protocols.

Suffice to say, years from now when White Sox fans fondly remember Giolito’s gem, there will not be, say, 100,000 or so people claiming they were there to see it in person.

At one point early in the game, some members of grounds crew drifted in sight, but that was about it outside of the teams.

An All-Star last year, the 26-year-old Giolito (3-2) matched his career high for strikeouts set in his previous start against Detroit.

Only a four-pitch walk to Gonzalez leading off the fourth inning got in Giolito’s way of perfection. That was only runner he permitted while throwing 101 pitches

""I’ve been working for this type of game for a while now and it’s really cool that we got it done,"" Giolito said.

Giolito relied on his changeup and fastball to make quick work of the Pirates, who came into the game batting just .229 and have the worst record in the majors. Six of their starters finished the game hitting under .199 this season.

The White Sox rushed toward the mound after the final out in Giolito’s first career no-hitter. Giolito hugged catcher James McCann as the Chicago players joined the party.

The South Side of Chicago normally rattles with fireworks after a home win -- this is the club that gave the game the exploding scoreboard -- but the park remained silent as the dugout emptied.

Giolito, meanwhile, was locked in his own zone in the later innings, fully aware of what was at stake.

""After the seventh, six more outs, looking at who I was facing, became very, very, very possible,"" he said, ""and then we were able to get it done.""

Giolito said his approach never wavered.

""Just staying with the same, like, mental routine for every single pitch. One pitch at a time. Full focus, full execution, straight through the target,"" he said.

Giolito pitched the 19th no-hitter in White Sox history — second most to the Dodgers' 23 — and first since Philip Humber threw a perfect game at Seattle in 2012. This was the seventh time the Pirates have been held hitless, with Washington’s Max Scherzer having done it in 2015.

White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson made a nifty play on a grounder by Bryan Reynolds up the middle in the seventh to preserve the gem, helped by first baseman Jose Abreu’s stretch at the bag.

In the ninth, Gonzalez hit a liner that Engel, a fleet centre fielder for most of his career, caught on the run at knee-high height.

""Yeah man, I think I got it,"" Gonzalez said. ""With that at-bat, I was a little bit mad because I don’t want to be part of history.""

Giolito improved to 30-28 in his big league career. He made his debut with Washington in 2016, then was traded after that season to the White Sox in a package for outfielder Adam Eaton.

Giolito gave up a major league-high 118 earned runs in 2018, his first full season in Chicago.

""I was pretty much bottom of the league in almost every stat,"" Giolito said. ""I kind of had to ... learn from failure to learn my true potential.""

He added: ""I always envisioned that I’d throw a no-hitter in the big leagues.""

Giolito threw the first no-hitter at Guaranteed Rate Field since Minnesota’s Francisco Liriano did it in 2011.

The White Sox, who’ve won eight of their last nine, ended the Pirates’ season-best winning streak at three games.

Giolito was dominant in his previous start, too, fanning 13 against Detroit and allowing just three hits in seven innings. The victory over Pittsburgh was his third career shutout.

Chicago’s first three batters reached in the second and all three came home one at a time after Engel’s groundout and singles Anderson and Eloy Jimenez. McCann added a sacrifice fly in the third off Steven Brault (0-1).

TRAINER’S ROOM

Pirates: RH reliever Keone Kela was available to pitch after leaving Friday’s loss to Milwaukee with forearm tightness. … Infielders Colin Moran (collision) and Kevin Newman (abdomen) also were on the bench after leaving Sunday’s game.

White Sox: McCann stayed in the game after being struck near his left hand by a second-inning pitch from Brault. ... Jimenez appeared to be getting treatment near the mound after the celebration, but manager Rick Renteria said he walked off under his own power.

His team gave up a goal he felt shouldn't have counted three minutes into the opening period and had a subsequent equalizer called back on a razor-thin offside challenge.

article continues below

Down 1-0 in the series and playing well, Tampa Bay then grabbed its first lead in more than 110 minutes of action midway through the third period only to see Boston tie it up with under four minutes to go in regulation.

""Adversity strikes in the weirdest ways,"" Cooper said. ""You never know when it's going to happen.

""Sometimes you're just dealt ... a sandwich that doesn't taste very good, if you know what I mean.""

And deal with it they did.

Ondrej Palat scored at 4:40 of overtime as the Lightning defeated the Bruins 4-3 to even their second-round playoff series 1-1.

Blake Coleman added two goals in regulation for the Lightning, while Nikita Kucherov had the other. Andrei Vasilevskiy made 22 saves to get the win.

""If there was one message that was going on it was we liked everything that was going on about the game,"" Cooper said. ""I know it sounds so cliche, but we just had to stick with it. Some teams, if you have mental weakness at all, you're probably sitting there saying, 'Poor us.'

""But it's just not been this group. That's not how they operate.""

Brad Marchand buried his second of the night to tie things with under four minutes left in the third period for the Bruins, while Nick Ritchie also scored. David Pastrnak added two assists for Boston, which got 36 stops from Jaroslav Halak.

The teams don't have much time to digest the result, with Game 3 of the best-of-seven matchup set for Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET back inside the fan-less Scotiabank Arena.

Tampa, which beat the Columbus Blue Jackets in quintuple overtime of Game 1 in the opening round before closing out the series in the extra period of Game 5 on a pair of goals from Brayden Point, got the winner after Boston couldn't clear its zone.

Patrick Maroon tried a wraparound that Halak stopped, but Palat was there to bury the rebound to score his first of the post-season and send the Lightning pouring off their bench in celebration.

""It's obviously big-time frustrating any time you lose a game and especially in that fashion,"" Bruins centre Sean Kuraly said. ""We thought we were trending in the right direction, (thinking) momentum may be swinging our way. You get the puck close to the blue line a couple times and you don't get it out, and against a good team that's what happens.

""It ends up in the back of your net.""

Acquired prior to February's trade deadline from the New Jersey Devils, Coleman gave Tampa its first lead of the series at 10:40 of the third after taking a stretch pass from Victor Hedman. The Lightning centre moved in alone on Halak and snuck an off-speed shot through the five-hole after getting slashed by Bruins defenceman Connor Clifton.

Boston, however, responded with 3:58 left in regulation when Marchand finished off a pretty passing play. With the Bruins in the middle of a change — Patrice Bergeron would normally be on the ice — Kuraly took a feed from Pastrnak and quickly found Marchand to bury his sixth and knot things up.

The Bruins, who triumphed 3-2 in Game 1 on the back of Halak's 35-save performance, took a 2-1 lead with 5:27 left in the second on a power play when Pastrnak faked a one-timer before sliding a pass to Marchand at the side of the net.

Tampa responded 56 seconds later after some great work from Point. The diminutive centre twisted and turned in the Bruins zone before finding Kevin Shattenkirk, whose shot was tipped in by Kucherov for his third.

The Lightning dressed seven defencemen with Ryan McDonagh (undisclosed), who has averaged a team-high 26:07 of ice time in the post-season, out injured after leaving midway through the third period of Game 1. Veteran blue-liners Luke Schenn and Braydon Coburn drew in, while Carter Verhaeghe was scratched up front.

Boston owned the best record in the NHL when the league suspended its season because of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, but dropped to the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference after losing all three of its games in the round-robin portion of the restart.

The Bruins found their groove in the first round of the usual 16-team playoff bracket, disposing of the Carolina Hurricanes in five games.

Tampa, meanwhile, had the second-best mark in the East and was fourth overall when the schedule was halted. The Lightning finished second in the round-robin and then downed Columbus.

The Bruins jumped out to a 1-0 lead at 3:14 of Tuesday's first period after Tampa defenceman Zach Bogosian's stick disintegrated at the offensive blue line. Boston broke the other way, with Ritchie stuffing his first past Vasilevskiy, who thought he had the puck covered — much to Cooper's chagrin.

The Lightning responded a couple minutes later when Barclay Goodrow tipped Coburn's point shot up and over Halak. The Bruins, however, correctly challenged for offside after Point was a fraction of a second too slow exiting the Boston zone on the tag up.

Cooper fired a number of expletives at the officials when the call was reversed, but was back smiling on the bench after a surprising burst from an unlikely source eventually knotted the score.

Bogosian, a bruising blue-liner known mostly for his physical play, split two Boston defenders, and as he was getting knocked down fed a diving Coleman, who slid his second past Halak before crashing into the net at 12:42.

""I saw Bogo picking up some speed,"" Coleman said. ""He just kind of had that look in his eye like he was about to do something. I just made it a point to get up into play with him, try to give him an option.

""He made a heck of a play.""

It was also the first sign the Lightning weren't going to be fazed by that early adversity.

""Any time there's a mishap, you just turn the page,"" Cooper said of his roster. ""It was needed tonight, I'll tell you that, because they need to be rewarded for the work they were doing.

""And in the end, they were.""

The All-Star guard scored 35 points and the Los Angeles Clippers rolled past the Dallas Mavericks 154-111 on Tuesday night to take a 3-2 lead in their first-round Western Conference playoff series.

George had shot 29% in the series and endured fans' wrath on social media. He said he spoke to the team psychiatrist before Game 5.

""I mean, whatever it was, the bubble got the best of me,"" George said. ""I was just in a dark place. I really wasn’t here. I checked out. The past couple of games, it was just difficult.""

George said it didn't feel like the playoffs until his teammates decided to create the atmosphere that was lacking inside the NBA's Walt Disney World bubble.

""I came in with that mindset that this is Staples, we’re at home,"" he said. ""The place is packed. I really had to psych myself up. I thought the whole team took that and we ran with it. We created our own energy. We decided to dictate this game.""

Kawhi Leonard scored 32 points and Montrezl Harrell added 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers, who set a franchise record for points in a playoff game. Los Angeles can clinch the series on Thursday.

Dallas' Luka Doncic, who hit a game-winner at the buzzer in Game 4 to cap off a 43-point triple-double, was held to 22 points on 6-for-17 shooting.

Dallas coach Rick Carlisle was ejected in the third quarter of the testy game, which included six technicals and a flagrant-1 foul.

Doncic said Clippers forward Marcus Morris might have stepped on his ankle intentionally early in the third quarter.

""I don’t want to talk to him,"" Doncic said. ""He’s just saying a lot of bad stuff to me all the game. I don’t want to talk to him. I’ve just got to move on. Like I said, everybody’s going to have their own opinion. I just hope it wasn’t intentional. If that was intentional, that’s very bad.""

Mavericks centre Kristaps Porzingis sat out with right knee soreness. It was the second straight game the 7-foot-3 Latvian missed.

Leonard scored 22 points and Paul George scored 18 to help Los Angeles take a 76-52 lead at halftime. The Clippers shot 61% in the first half and led by as many as 27 points.

The Clippers continued the onslaught in the second half, bumping the lead to as many as 45 points.

""Tough game,"" Carlisle said. ""Very poor performance by us. It was disappointing. It was very physical. We just need to have a stronger physical disposition to start the game and throughout. We’ve got to get some more traction at both ends of the floor.""

TIP-INS

Mavericks: Doncic was issued a technical foul in the second quarter. ... G Tim Hardaway Jr. was called for a flagrant-1 after winding up and hitting George in the face on a drive. ... Assistant Stephen Silas took over as coach after Carlisle was ejected.

Clippers: Shot 67% from the field in the first quarter. ... Hardaway and Morris were called for double technicals in the second quarter. C Ivica Zubac was called for a technical in the third.

BIGGER THAN BASKETBALL

Clippers coach Doc Rivers was emotional while discussing the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which has sparked national outrage and some violent protests. Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back while his three children watched.

""That video, if you watch that video — you don’t need to be Black to be outraged,"" Rivers said. ""You need to be American and outraged. How dare the Republicans talk about fear. We’re the ones that need to be scared. We’re the ones having to talk to every Black child. What white father has to give his son a talk about being careful if you get pulled over? It’s just ridiculous. It keeps going. There’s no charges. Breonna Taylor — no charges. Nothing. All we’re asking is you live up to the Constitution. That’s all we’re asking -- for everybody. For everyone.""

CARLISLE'S EJECTION

Carlisle described what led to his ejection. Hardaway had the ball at the free-throw line, and then Rivers was granted a timeout.

""My understanding in that situation is that once a shooter has the ball, a timeout cannot be called by the opposing coach,"" Carlisle said. ""I thought the call was wrong. So I was asking about it and wasn’t getting a great explanation and then it turned into a technical and then another technical. I’m just standing up for my team.""

Game 6 is Thursday.

During a press conference Wednesday morning, Isobel Mackenzie, B.C.’s seniors advocate, announced that her office was conducting a new survey of people’s experience with visit restrictions when they were mandated in March during the height of the pandemic.

The survey will ask questions about people’s visits to care homes before the pandemic, how often they visited, or, for residents, how often they received visitors and what types of activities they did during these visits, according to Mackenzie.

“Without a doubt, one of the most heart-breaking sacrifices that has been required of seniors and their loved ones has been for those 40,000 or so seniors who live in long-term care and assisted living that went without visits for over three months and who are still struggling with our revised visit limitations that for some are bearing very little resemblance to their pre-pandemic visits,” said Mackenzie.

While B.C. proceeded with an ease of restrictions on June 30 that allowed for one designated visitor per care home resident, Mackenzie said her office wanted to know more about how that arrangement was working for seniors and their families, and how it has ultimately affected their health and well-being.

Many seniors and their families throughout the province have contacted her office and described how they were struggling with social isolation due to visitor restrictions.

“We need a balance. And the question is: where is that balance? Yes, we want to keep people safe from COVID-19, but what are we keeping them safe for if it’s not to enjoy what’s left of their life,” said Mackenzie.

Since the pandemic started, outbreaks of the virus at seniors care facilities have accounted for the majority of B.C.’s more than 200 deaths, including a man in his 80s who passed away from the virus at North Vancouver’s Lynn Valley Care Centre in March and became the first documented case of someone dying from the novel coronavirus in Canada.

Mackenzie’s office plans to publish a report in October that outlines the experience of seniors living in long-term care, as well as that of the family members of those residents, under the COVID-19-era visit restrictions. The report will offer suggestions to help make the visit experience better while still maintaining safety, she said.

“That will help us understand how we can shape a visit policy that we can live with for the next year,” she said.

The survey is available at www.carehomevisits.ca. The link will be shared with long-term care and assisted-living staff who can help residents complete it, according to Mackenzie.

Care home residents or family members can also call 1-877-952-3181 to have a copy of the survey mailed to them for completion, or to complete the survey over the phone.

Feedback is being accepted for the provincewide survey until Sept. 30."

Out of the 22 cases, 14 have been residents and eight are staff members, said the email. The outbreak started with one staff member.

“Ten residents with COVID are being cared for by our clinical team in isolation areas,” says the email. “One resident and one staff member have recovered and sadly we’ve had three residents pass away. At the direction of Fraser Health (FHA) we have tested 200+ residents and staff, with the vast majority of tests coming back negative.

The latest positive cases follow three other “outbreaks” – the term used by Fraser Health – at Burnaby care homes.

One worker at Stay Fresh in Metropolis at Metrotown tested positive and that store was closed temporarily. Read more about that here.

According to an update by provincial health officials on Tuesday, there were 58 new cases identified, including one presumed, or ""epi-linked"" case, meaning that since the pandemic started, B.C. has discovered 5,242 cases of COVID-19. Of those patients, 4,114 have recovered, and 203 have died.

Those battling infections who are not in hospital are self-isolating at home. There are also 2,675 people who are under active public-health monitoring as a result of identified exposure to known cases.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections in the province by health region is:

• 1,683 in Vancouver Coastal Health (up 32);

• 2,762 in Fraser Health (up 23);

• 168 in Island Health (up two);

• 425 in Interior Health (no change);

• 128 in Northern Health (up one); and

• 76 people who reside outside Canada (no change).

Fraser Health's interim chief medical health officer Elizabeth Brodkin, on August 25, mentioned two situations where there has been COVID-19 at hospitals.

She said a COVID-19 outbreak has taken place at Langley Memorial Hospital, which involved a single patient who was released and then tested positive for the disease. Brodkin declined to say when the patient was at Langley Memorial Hospital, and released, in order to protect that person's confidentiality. News of the incident arose on August 25.

She added that at Royal Columbian Hospital one staff person tested positive after having conducted surgery in an operating room. Brodkin said that this case was likely contracted in the community so it is not officially considered an outbreak at the hospital.

Antibodies work to bind a virus – such as COVID-19 – and target it towards the immune system, which would then go forth and destroy the virus, said Lobo.

The Canadian Coalition for COVID-19 – which includes Richmond-based SignalChem – has spent months developing and sequencing antibodies taken from the blood of a llama immunized against COVID-19.

The coalition is now making that data available to researchers around the globe for free in an effort to help accelerate the development of a treatment for the coronavirus.

SignalChem was approached by a Vancouver-based biotech company, NovoBind, earlier this year when the pandemic was still at its height in China, about forming the coalition along with other Canadian biotech companies, and launching the project, said SignalChem’s technical project manager Paolo Lobo.

Typically, said Lobo, when it comes to research or vaccine and treatment development, there’s a goal of making money or publishing in a high-end journal.

“As a result, people end up hiding or protecting their own work until its ready, rather than getting it out there for free so the quickest and most efficient progress can happen,” he said.

“The whole idea behind this is to just get it done and forget about the money, forget about publishing, and hope that it can make a much quicker impact.”

Nanobodies are fragments of antibodies, created by analyzing a genetic sequence, and llamas have been increasingly used by researchers for both treatment and vaccine development.

SignalChem’s strength is creating proteins, said Lobo, which is the first step in any immunization project.

The company created a COVID-19 viral protein – essentially a small portion of the virus, similar to a vaccine – which, in March, was sent to Ontario, where coalition partner Cedarlane injected the sample into Maple the llama (the llama, said Lobo, is fine).

Maple then created antibodies against the virus, and Cedarlane took a small blood sample from the llama to send back to B.C. in June, where it was used by NovoBind – which initiated the project and coalition – to isolate the antibodies’ genetic sequence in June and July.

“With those sequences, people can now make nanobodies that can, ideally, treat COVID,” said Lobo.

Antibodies work to bind a virus – such as COVID-19 – and target it towards the immune system, which would then go forth and destroy the virus, said Lobo.

In this case, the nanobody has the same effect, acting like a socket that plugs into the virus so that it can’t invade the immune system. Its small size means that it’s able to get into areas that the larger antibodies couldn’t reach.

“And then, because (the virus) cannot invade, it’s basically floating around vulnerable to your immune system,” said Lobo. “A virus is very simple, if it cannot invade (your cells), it cannot replicate, and that’s it – it’s dead.”

Llamas create antibodies that are quite simple, said Lobo, in comparison to the more complex ones generated by people – imagine, he said, human antibodies as Optimus Prime, while llama antibodies are “just the arm that would punch (the virus).”

“So right off the bat, it’s much simpler than our antibodies, which is a really good thing for people who are trying to mass-make antibodies, because they’re more stable when they’re not that complex,” said Lobo.

It’s also much cheaper and more efficient to create nanobodies from llama antibodies, Lobo added, as opposed to “trying to assemble a full transformer.”

“The antibody itself, it’s easy to break up into even smaller pieces that just bind the virus, and that’s all they need to do to stop it from invading human cells.”

Lobo said that these nanobodies, however, are more of a treatment for COVID-19, rather than a vaccine, as they won’t provide a person’s immune system with the information needed to develop its own antibodies against the virus – which is what a vaccine does.

The coalition has now released the 51 genetic sequences isolated by Novobind so that other researchers – including SignalChem – can perform tests to see if there is a “magic nanobody in there that is going to very nicely treat COVID” – meaning the nanobody is effective at neutralizing the virus so that it can’t get into a human cell – said Lobo.

“We hope there will be more people involved that will pick it up and start testing these sequences and see what they can do to try to get them to work,” he said.

While the sequences have been released under an open source model, researchers seeking access to them will be required to sign a pledge, said Lobo.

“(The pledge) says that if something huge comes of this, and we are able to make this amazing treatment, that it be available to everybody, including the places or people that cannot afford it, so that they don’t just have this amazing drug that is too expensive.”"

According to an Aug. 24 internal memorandum seen by The Tri-City News, a contracted employee working with Certispec — a laboratory testing company responsible for quality control — came down with symptoms of COVID-19 after working a dayshift on Saturday, Aug. 22.

“Earlier this evening, PCT received confirmation that one of Certispec’s workers tested positive for COVID-19 today,” wrote PCT operations manager Beau Storey to staff, later writing the worker immediately began 14 days of isolation.

Representatives for both PCT and Certispec have confirmed the case to The Tri-City News and both said they have completed their own internal investigation.

“The jobs that we do are mainly outside,” said Certispec regional operations manager Garth Collyer. “We don’t have any interaction with the public and we have limited interaction with the terminal staff.”

The port acts as a major waypoint for sulphur, potash, canola oil and ethylene glycol — a high-grade antifreeze used in the production of synthetic fibres like Gore-Tex — which arrive to Port Moody aboard Canadian Pacific trains before getting shipped overseas.

The employee is one of about three Certispec workers usually onsite at the facility. Tasked with gathering samples of ethylene glycol, the employee worked alone, wore personal protective equipment and used his own vehicle, according to the internal memo.

Collyer said one other staff member was contacted by Fraser Health, but that based on limited interaction with the man now in isolation, the contact tracing ended there.

Fraser Health has yet to respond to the status of its contact-tracing investigation.

After interviewing the foreman and other workers from that shift, Certispec and Pacific Coast Terminals found the person who fell ill with the virus had only worked once since Aug. 10 and did not come in contact with anyone else at the facility.

Following their investigations, the memo says “any risk from the incident would be extremely low, if not negligible.”

The Port Moody case comes as COVID-19 hospitalizations rise to an 11-week high across B.C. As of Aug. 25, there are a record 925 British Columbians battling the virus across the province after a record single-day case total of 107 over the weekend."

There were 58 new cases identified overnight, including one presumed, or ""epi-linked"" case, meaning that since the pandemic started, B.C. has discovered 5,242 cases of COVID-19. Of those patients, 4,114 have recovered, and 203 have died.

Those battling infections who are not in hospital are self-isolating at home. There are also 2,675 people who are under active public-health monitoring as a result of identified exposure to known cases.

Some good news is that there have been no new deaths as a result of the novel coronavirus that first appeared in B.C. in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections in the province by health region is:

She added that at Royal Columbian Hospital one staff person tested positive after having conducted surgery in an operating room. Brodkin said that this case was likely contracted in the community so it is not officially considered an outbreak at the hospital.

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

We continue to test everyone with possible COVID-19 symptoms, so please do not hesitate to call if you become ill.
Our local medical clinics remain open Monday to Friday, with the Gibsons Medical Clinic providing additional hours on Saturday mornings.
Please check the Coast Reporter and The Local Weekly for periodic updates on COVID-19 in our community.
Sincerely,The Sunshine Coast COVID Physician Task ForceDr Jennifer BaxterDr Ted KrickanDr Herman MentzDr Brian NelsonDr Daren Spithoff","Dear Fellow Sunshine Coast Residents:

Over the last two weeks, we have seen provincial COVID-19 numbers double again, with an average of over 80 new cases per day. As per the BCCDC, there have been 50 new cases in the North Shore Coast Garibaldi region, which includes the Sunshine Coast, over the past two weeks. While this does not give us any information about our local numbers, it is safe to assume that COVID-19 is in our community as well.

article continues below

Although we have not had a community or health facility outbreak here on the Coast, we cannot take this for granted. We are only one house party or family gathering away from the rapidly increasing numbers that we are seeing elsewhere in the province and around the world, and we must continue to protect ourselves, our families and our community as best we can.

We cannot overemphasize the importance of maintaining every precaution to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It starts with our bubbles, the people we have chosen to interact with in close proximity without masks, social distancing, or other precautions.

Please keep your COVID bubble as small as possible; it should include household members, and no more than a few close friends. Your bubble should not include people who are a part of other bubbles, as this expands your bubble to everyone in those other bubbles. If your bubble includes dozens of people, the risk of a community outbreak increases, and it becomes very difficult to limit the spread of COVID-19 should anyone in your bubble become infected.

For interactions with people outside of our bubbles, we must do everything we can to limit the spread of COVID-19. Maintain two metres between yourself and those around you. Meet up with friends outdoors whenever possible. Wear a mask if you are in a store or a bus or another place where you can’t maintain social distancing. Wash your hands frequently, especially after touching surfaces that may have been touched by others, or before and after touching your face or your mask.

If you are younger and in good health, you are at lowest risk for complications due to COVID-19, but highest risk for transmitting COVID-19 without even knowing you have it. Please take every precaution that you can to avoid being THAT person.

We anticipate that the number of new cases in the province will continue to rise over the next number of weeks and months. Although the majority of current infections are in people under 40, the more people who are infected, the higher risk there is to our more vulnerable community members.

If we do have a community outbreak, we are all going to need to step up as a community to get through this, and we would encourage everyone to think about how you can help if this happens. This may range from checking in on a friend or neighbour who is more vulnerable, to helping deliver groceries or other necessities (in a safe way), to taking on caregiving responsibilities for a close friend or family member. If we all continue to work together, we will get through this.

If you do develop new cold or flu symptoms (no matter how mild), please stay home and self-isolate until you have been assessed. Do NOT go to work. Do NOT hit the drive-through on your way home. Do NOT go shopping (unless it’s online). Do NOT meet up with others. Do call your family doctor or the Respiratory Assessment Clinic (Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.) to arrange for further assessment and testing, if indicated. The Respiratory Assessment Clinic can be reached by phone or text at 604-740-1252 or by email at coastrespclinic@gmail.com.

Please note that even if you have a negative swab you should continue to stay home and self-isolate until your symptoms have resolved. If your symptoms worsen, please do not hesitate to call the Respiratory Assessment Clinic for further assessment.

We continue to test everyone with possible COVID-19 symptoms, so please do not hesitate to call if you become ill. If you have more severe symptoms and believe you may need to be admitted to hospital, please go to the Sechelt Hospital Emergency Department. If you need an ambulance, please call 911. Please remember that the Emergency Department is open and safe for anyone with a medical emergency.

With respect to non-emergent non-COVID-19 health issues, all of our family medicine clinics are currently booking their own patients, as well as people without a local family doctor. Our local medical clinics remain open Monday to Friday, with the Gibsons Medical Clinic providing additional hours on Saturday mornings.

In order to provide as safe an environment as possible for both patients and staff, the majority of medical care will continue to be provided virtually. This is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. If you have a medical issue that requires a physical assessment, an in-person appointment will be arranged.

If you are worried that you may have been exposed to COVID-19 after hearing about an outbreak in an area you have visited recently, the dates and locations of COVID-19 public exposures are online for each health region (Vancouver Coastal Health, Fraser Health, Interior Health, Vancouver Island Health, Northern Health).

Health Canada has also created COVID Alert, a new app for iOS and Android that will notify you if you have been near anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19 (and has the app). It is completely anonymous and does not share your location or any identifying information. It is currently only active in Ontario, but is expected to be launched Canada-wide soon, so not a bad idea to download the app if you are interested in having an extra layer of protection.

Please check the Coast Reporter and The Local Weekly for periodic updates on COVID-19 in our community. As local parks, programs and facilities open up, please visit the SCRD, the Town of Gibsons, and the District of Sechelt websites for updates.

Keep well, wash your hands, keep your distance or wear a mask, stay local if you can, and please keep doing everything you can to keep our community safe!

Sincerely,

The Sunshine Coast COVID Physician Task Force

The national project was launched by Roberta Timothy, an assistant professor with the University of Toronto's Institute for Pandemics.

Timothy says many members of the Black and Indigenous communities already avoid interacting with the health-care system mostly due to experiences with racism and biases.

During a global pandemic, Timothy says that can have grave consequences for the well-being of those communities.

""People will seek help when it's an emergency and by then it's too late,"" she says. ""Because of the bias, because of anti-black racism, because of violence they experience, their health becomes more at risk.""

Timothy says there's a need for more data to effectively understand the impact of COVID-19 on racialized communities.

The Ontario government refused to collect race-based data earlier in the pandemic, but it was forced to change course in June. Now it mandates the collection of data around race, income, household size and language when following up with people who've been infected with COVID-19.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Health said the government is engaging with people from racialized communities and other health equity experts regarding the data collection.

""We plan to share findings of this data collection, informed by this engagement,"" David Jensen said in an email.

Jensen said the ministry is concerned about the spread of the virus in ""certain groups of people and in certain neighbourhoods,"" and would welcome additional insights and information about how COVID-19 is affecting racialized communities.

Early data compiled by Toronto Public Health showed that 83 per cent of COVID-19 cases occurred in racialized people. Black people represented 21 per cent of cases in Toronto, but only nine per cent of the city's population.

""There is growing evidence in North America and beyond that racialized people and people living in lower-income households are more likely to be affected by COVID-19,"" said Dr. Christine Navarro, associate medical officer of health for Toronto.

""While the exact reasons for this have yet to be fully understood, we believe it is related to both poverty and racism.""

Timothy's project will collect more data about how Black and Indigenous people interact with the health-care system, but also about economic impacts, evictions, support networks and essential work being done by marginalized communities.

""An underlying part of the project is not only to bring better data, but to support the community in strategizing and finding interventions to find how we get through this,"" said Timothy.

Rudayna Bahubeshi, a Toronto resident and post-graduate student in public policy, says she has first-hand experience with racism in the health-care system. During a stint in a mood disorder ward when she was 18, Bahubeshi said a nurse mistook her for a 30-year-old patient — the only other Black person in the ward at the time — and tried to make her take the other person's medication.

Bahubeshi says she argued but was ignored, and believes her race was a factor in the way she was treated by staff. She says the nurse only realized the mistake when the other patient happened to walk by.

In another hospital visit during the pandemic, Bahubeshi says she was taken to a ""COVID ward"" because she had fever. She says staff would not answer simple questions about whether there were risks involved with using a shared washroom, or about the fact that some staff weren't wearing PPE.

""The way she (the nurse) was engaging with me was very much that I was the problem,"" says Bahubeshi. ""When I talked to a doctor afterwards they told me I was fully in the right and that was unacceptable.""

Bahubeshi says experiences like those erode her trust in the public health system and its ability to provide quality care for her. She says more data about the experience of Black people in health care will be a first step in the right direction.

""The fact that we don't have race-based data is a way we've decided that Black communities are not a priority,"" said Bahubeshi.

Timothy's national project is set to begin in a few months, and will involve surveys and focus groups among Black and Indigenous Canadians.

Eric Caire, minister responsible for digital transformation, said Tuesday the app isn't needed at the moment because the province's infection rate is in decline.

""Given that the pandemic is under control ... in Quebec with the measures in place, the government of Quebec has decided not to go ahead with a contact notification application app,"" he said.

But, Caire added, health officials are still doing the groundwork needed to deploy a contact tracing app if it becomes necessary in the future.

The free and voluntary COVID Alert app uses random Bluetooth codes, not location data, to notify users if their phones have recently spent time near the phone of a person who later tests positive for COVID-19.

The app is linked to the Ontario health system and the federal government said it planned to deploy the technology across the country.

Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said Tuesday that federal officials would like as many Canadians as possible to download the app.

""Sometimes Canadians or people who reside in this country do travel interprovincially,"" she said in Ottawa. ""Having an application that can apply across jurisdictional borders is very helpful.""

Tam added, however, that the app was only ""one layer of protection,"" in addition to all the other measures governments were taking to control the pandemic.

Quebec Health Minister Christian Dube said Tuesday his province remains open to using the technology but wants more time to evaluate it and to address public concerns. ""I think we didn't say no. We said we don't need it right now.""

An online public consultation conducted in July and early August indicated that 77 per cent of the 16,456 Quebecers surveyed believed the app could be useful, and 75 per cent said they were ready to install it.

Dube said the numbers suggest there's still ""nervousness"" surrounding the idea of the app, even though most Quebecers are open to it under certain conditions.

But Premier Francois Legault, speaking in St-Hyacinthe, Que., later in the day, said many Quebecers, as well as the province's three main opposition parties, were uncomfortable with the technology.

""What we see in Quebec is that at least a good part of Quebecers are scared about protecting their personal data,"" he said. ""So they don't agree with this tracing application.""

A number of experts who testified in front of a Quebec legislative commission also expressed concern about contact tracing apps.

Legault said that if an app is needed, he'd prefer to use one developed in Quebec.

Dr. Theresa Tam made the comments during a news conference Tuesday while responding to the Statistics Canada survey, which found nearly one-quarter of respondents unlikely or unsure whether they would get a COVID-19 vaccine.

Many experts and political leaders have touted the successful development and widespread rollout of a vaccine as essential for an eventual return to normalcy, including the full reopening of economies and ending physical distancing.

More than 76 per cent of respondents in the Statistics Canada survey indicated they would likely get inoculated if and when a vaccine is ready. Yet 14 per cent said they were somewhat or very unlikely to do so. Nine per cent remained unsure.

Those who indicated they were unlikely to get a vaccine were asked to identify the reasons for their reluctance. More than half cited a lack of confidence in its safety while a similar number said they were worried about potential risks and side effects.

About one-quarter of respondents, who were allowed to give more than one answer, said they did not consider it necessary to get the vaccine while about 10 per cent indicated they did not believe in vaccines at all.

More than one-third said they would likely just wait until the vaccine seemed safe.

The survey also indicated younger Canadians and those who don't have a university degree are more likely to be hesitant or nervous about a vaccine than those who are older and more educated.

The crowd-sourced survey of around 4,000 Canadians was conducted between June 15-21. It cannot be given a margin of error because the participants do not represent a random sample.

Asked about the survey, Tam underscored the importance of ""vaccine confidence,"" describing it as integral to the successful rollout of vaccine.

She went on to promise that regulators won't take any shortcuts with safety despite the government agreeing to several changes to the clinical-trial process to get a potential COVID-19 vaccine developed faster.

""Just because it's an accelerated process to get vaccines for Canadians does not mean we're going to shortchange anything on safety and effectiveness,"" Tam said. ""I do have confidence in our regulatory system.""

Tam also took aim at the spread of falsehoods about vaccines online.

""I do think social media and internet companies do have responsibilities in terms of their role in the space,"" she said.

""So I would look towards different partners, different government departments also coming together to look at how we better address some of the misinformation that's in that space.""

She is not the first to speak out on this issue, as some have blamed the growing number and influence of anti-vaccination groups online for a resurgence in childhood diseases such as measles.

Facebook announced last year that it would be cracking down on so-called ""anti-vaxxer"" groups, which included labelling posts deemed as containing false information about vaccines. The social media giant now being sued by one such group in California.

Josh Greenberg, a communications professor at Carleton University who has been studying Canadians' attitudes towards a COVID-19 vaccine, said safety concerns aren't unexpected, given the pressure governments and industry are facing to get something working fast.

Yet he said it is essential that Ottawa push back against misinformation campaigns, which have been growing in numbers and influence even as governments around the world have been slow to react.

""When you look at issues like COVID-19 and the campaign to ready or prepare the public for the eventual release of a vaccine, you're talking about a battle for both hearts and minds,"" Greenberg said.

""It's not just an information battle of trying to make sure that people have accurate information, but that you are persuading them in such a way that they trust the veracity of the information you're providing and they also trust the source of that information.""

While the world is rushing to find a vaccine for COVID-19, new reports of several people having been reinfected with the novel coronavirus after testing positive once before raise concerns that it might be a moving target.

Deputy chief public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo said the cases in Hong Kong, Belgium and the Netherlands highlight ongoing questions about immunity to COVID-19 and the need for an effective vaccine.

The extended coronavirus-induced border closure shut down two border crossings for the town of about 1,300 people, who must commute 40 kilometres through Canada to get to the rest of Washington state.

""We really need that border open to survive,"" said Tamra Hansen, who owns the Saltwater Cafe in Point Roberts.

The economy still depends on the flow of people and resources to and from the border, which closed in March and will remain closed through at least Sept. 21, KING-TV reports.

""I rely on approximately 90 per cent of my business from the Canadians, that come from the seasonal people,"" Hansen said. ""And we make our money in the summer to get through the winter.""

There is no regular ferry or air service to Point Roberts. There have been no confirmed coronavirus cases reported in the town.

In 2019, 1.4 million people crossed the border into Point Roberts. So far this year, there have been just 217,000 visitors.

Gov. Jay Inslee penned a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last Friday addressing these concerns. Inslee cited in his letter the need for a ""practical solution to this issue"" and emphasized ""unique hardships"" faced by Point Roberts residents.

It followed a similar letter to the U.S. ambassador to Canada co-written by the state's senators, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, and two other Washington state congresspeople.

The city was created because of a quirk in the Oregon Treaty of 1846 between the United Kingdom and the United States. The two countries agreed to settle their border dispute by dividing their territories in the Pacific Northwest along the 49th parallel. But that left the small area of Point Roberts on the southern tip of the Tsawwassen peninsula in American control.

Darryl Marquette, an employee at TSB Shipping in Point Roberts, says the shipping company has had boxes meant for Canada backlogged for months because of the border closures.

Residents like Brian Calder, a longtime resident who worked as a city councillor in Vancouver, have advocated for relief, saying that citizens of Point Roberts should be given an exemption to cross the border.

""Businesses here are down 80 per cent — down 80 per cent!"" said Calder. ""They can’t survive through this winter. Like, it’s not possible. I’m really pessimistic about the recovery here.""

Canada recently ironed out a plan to allow those in Alaska to cross the border at five specific ports using car placards to identify themselves.

Hansen worries, though, that the efforts of its citizens and lawmakers will be futile.

""All the other restaurants have closed down, the golf course is closed,"" Hansen said. ""Quite honestly, I probably should have just closed.""

The number of coronavirus infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some — especially older adults and people with existing health problems — it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death."

Respondents to the poll, conducted by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies, were split about the prospect of a confidence vote triggering a federal election this fall, with 42 per cent opposed to an election and 38 per cent in favour.

But if there were an election today, 38 per cent of decided voters said they'd support Trudeau's Liberals, compared to 30 per cent for the Conservatives, 18 per cent for the NDP and six per cent for the Greens.

The Bloc Quebecois were at 33 per cent in Quebec, statistically tied with the Liberals in that province at 32 per cent, with the Conservatives well behind at 16 per cent, the NDP at 12 per cent and the Greens at four per cent.

When asked specifically which party would earn their vote should Erin O'Toole be at the helm of the Conservatives, Liberal support actually bumped up one point while Conservative support dropped to 27 per cent.

However, the poll suggests O'Toole — who was crowned Conservative leader in the wee hours of Monday morning, one day after the survey was completed — is an unknown quantity for a majority of Canadians.

Asked if they'd be more or less likely to vote Conservative if O'Toole was at the helm, fully 51 per cent said they didn't know. Another 37 per cent said they'd be less likely while just 13 per cent said they'd be more likely.

While Conservative fortunes could improve as voters get to know O'Toole, the poll suggests he will need time to make a dent in their largely positive impression of Trudeau.

Respondents rated Trudeau by a significant margin as the most decisive, intelligent, and charismatic leader and the best communicator. He was also deemed the most caring and compassionate, although on that score NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was rated a relatively close second.

Singh got top marks on honesty and integrity, with 24 per cent saying he best shows those qualities, compared to 16 per cent for Trudeau, who has been mired for months in the WE Charity scandal, and 12 per cent for O'Toole.

In Quebec, Bloc Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet was rated the most honest, decisive and intelligent and the best communicator.

On the issues that would likely dominate an election campaign in the fall, Trudeau enjoyed a substantial lead over rival leaders. (The Greens, who are in the midst of a leadership contest were not included in these questions).

He was seen as the leader who'd do the best job getting Canada's pandemic-ravaged economy back on track by 30 per cent, compared to 20 per cent for O'Toole, 11 per cent for Singh and just three per cent for Blanchet.

He was rated the best leader to manage the federal deficit, projected to hit almost $350 billion this year due to the pandemic (27 per cent to O'Toole's 23 per cent, Singh's nine per cent and Blanchet's three per cent).

He was also rated the leader who'd do the best job caring for Canadians hurt by the pandemic (35 per cent to O'Toole's 13 per cent, Singh's 19 per cent and Blanchet's four per cent)

And he was seen by far as the leader who would best keep Canadians safe from a second wave of the deadly coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (39 per cent to O'Toole's 13 per cent, Singh's 12 per cent and Blanchet's three per cent).

Trudeau last week prorogued Parliament until Sept. 23, when he intends to introduce a throne speech laying out a post-pandemic recovery plan for the country. Trudeau has all but dared opposition parties to bring his government down over the throne speech, which will be put to a confidence vote.

Leger executive vice-president Christian Bourque said Liberal support has rebounded since the WE Charity affair exploded in late June. But it could dip again if there are new revelations or when the federal ethics watchdog releases the findings of his investigation into possible conflict of interest violations by Trudeau and his former finance minister, Bill Morneau.

If it weren't for that ethical cloud hanging over the government, Bourque said the poll suggests a fall election ""would be great timing for Mr. Trudeau"" — while O'Toole is still unknown.

""I think the Conservatives need time,"" Bourque said in an interview, adding that Blanchet is the only leader for whom there appears to be no potential downside to a fall election.

The online survey of 1,516 adult Canadians was conducted Aug. 21-23. It cannot be assigned a margin of error because internet-based polls are not considered random samples.

The poll also gauged Canadians' views on the pandemic and its impact on the economy.

Forty-three per cent of respondents said they fear the economic crisis, already the deepest since the Great Depression, will get worse in the next 12 months; only 21 per cent believe it will get better while 25 per cent think it will stay the same.

Fully 77 per cent predicted there'll be a second wave of the pandemic. And 58 per cent said they think it is likely that over the next three months the country will be plunged back into lockdown, with businesses closed and citizens ordered once again to stay at home.

Despite those fears, 68 per cent said they would not take a free dose of the untested vaccine Russia has produced to immunize against COVID-19; only 14 per cent said they would take it, 18 per cent said they didn't know.

Seventy-six per cent said they remain very or somewhat satisfied with the measures the federal Liberal government has taken to deal with the pandemic; 77 per cent said the same of their provincial governments.

There has been only one new death since then, however.

“Despite the recent outbreaks and clusters that we have seen in the past week, and the rising case numbers, we still have low undetected transmission in our province,” Henry said Monday. “We are able to find and connect most people who have this disease.”

B.C. has lately ramped up testing to 4,000 to 5,000 tests per day. Henry said the test positive results remain ""relatively low."" She would be worried if the test positive numbers started climbing.

""Right now we are staying within the range of where we need to be,"" Henry said.

Henry suggested that everyone has to learn to live with the reality of the virus and not expect it to suddenly disappear.

""There are many more months of this to come,"" she said.

While Henry said that there has been a recent increase in infections among people in their 50s and 60s, the vast majority of the new cases are in younger people, and many of the sources of transmission are larger gatherings and private parties.

Last week, B.C. introduced new fines for individuals who hold large parties, and some hosts have already received $2,000 fines for hosting parties that breach the rules around physical distancing and limiting the number of people in a confined space.

""I think that it's the right thing to do and I think it's being used in the right way -- very judiciously,"" Henry said. ""We want to do it in a progressive way for those who really are breaking the rules intentionally.""

“The leadership told everyone in the store that they won’t say who has it or which department they are in,” said the employee, whose name has been withheld by the NOW due to concerns about being disciplined for speaking up. “All the team members are really scared.”

The employee who contacted the NOW says they are now afraid to go back to work.

When contacted by the NOW , Whole Foods confirmed via email that a “Team Member in our Burnaby store has been diagnosed with COVID-19,” adding that the company wasn’t going to share more details “out of respect for the privacy of our Team Members,” including the date of the positive test.

“The results were alarming,” said a news release.

A significant number of all respondents (63%) reported experiencing increased mental health issues (high anxiety, insomnia, depression) “related specifically to their housing precarity.”

Despite government programs like Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the B.C. Temporary Rent Supplement (TRS), 32% of respondents reported having to borrow, use credit, or dip into savings in order to maintain rent payments, said the VTU.

“Premier Horgan stated in March that nobody would lose their home as a result of COVID-19,” said VTU volunteer Mazdak Gharibnavaz. “But rents are so high that, even with financial supports, renters are sacrificing the basics, going hungry, and those who have fallen behind are still at risk of eviction because the protections are being withdrawn.”



The province announced recently a framework in which renters would start repaying missed rent payments and that landlords couldn’t use missed rent between March and September as a reason for eviction, unless repayments were missed.

“In a sense, the fear of healthcare workers is not so different from the bigger problem of pandemic-related racism.","Many people who show support for healthcare workers with nightly noise-making also avoid healthcare workers throughout the day.

That’s the findings of new UBC research, which claims fears have arisen among the general public about coming into contact with healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

One in four people surveyed went so far as to agree that the freedoms of healthcare workers should be restricted.

The study is believed to be the first on stigmatization of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Being around healthcare workers is not dangerous,” said Steven Taylor, a professor of psychiatry in UBC’s faculty of medicine and lead author of the study published last week by the Journal of Anxiety Disorders.

“People need to look at the facts and understand that we don’t need to add to the stress that healthcare workers are already experiencing. If we create burdens on our healthcare workers, it’s going to undermine their ability to perform their jobs properly.”

Nearly one-third believe healthcare workers ‘likely’ to have COVID-19

The research team surveyed a random sample of 3,551 people in Canada and the U.S. between May 6 and 19 to see if they would discriminate against healthcare workers based on fears they could carry the virus that causes COVID-19.

One in three respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement: “I do not want to be around someone who works in a healthcare setting.”

Statement % in agreement

Healthcare workers who work in hospitals are likely to have COVID-19 32

For the safety of the community, healthcare workers should not go out in public. 25

I do not want to be around someone who works in a healthcare setting. 33

Healthcare workers who treat people with COVID-19 should be separated from their families 31

Those who cheer provided similar answers

The researchers also asked respondents how often they participated in nightly shows of support for healthcare workers. Clapping, cheering and banging pots didn’t make a person any less likely to stigmatize healthcare workers.

“What struck me the most was this combination of people getting out there and applauding from the safety of their balconies, but also having some very strong and mistaken beliefs about the dangers that healthcare workers pose,” Taylor said.

Previous research has shown that COVID-19 is only slightly more prevalent among healthcare workers than it is among the general population: 0.14 per cent compared to 0.10 per cent. Experts believe much of this difference can be attributed to more testing among healthcare workers.

Data from this study showed that stigmatization was closely related to COVID-19 Stress Syndrome, which had been identified by Taylor in earlier research and is characterized by:

• fears that COVID-19 is highly dangerous;

• a tendency to view foreigners as sources of infection;

• avoidance of public places like supermarkets where encounters with other people are likely.

“When people become threatened by infection, they do develop phobias and become worried about coming into contact with certain groups of people,” Taylor said. “In a sense, the fear of healthcare workers is not so different from the bigger problem of pandemic-related racism. They are all inter-linked.”

While the COVID-19 pandemic does carry risks for healthcare workers, the risk of contracting the virus is not high among them. Workplace stress is a much bigger problem, and stigmatization only compounds that mental health risk.

The researchers call for clear, sensible public education campaigns to help people understand that healthcare workers pose little risk to the public."

As B.C. gets set to open schools, the Ambulance Paramedics of BC want to help alleviate anxiety among parents by sharing some tips to ensure children – especially the younger set – wear masks and wash their hands properly.

article continues below

“Every year at the start of the school season, we educate parents and children about hazards of the road,” said Troy Clifford, president of Ambulance Paramedics of BC. Who would have thought we would add a pandemic to our public education?”

“Research shows that children as young as three understand the concept of germs,” said Megan Lawrence, public education director with the Ambulance Paramedics of BC. “Good hand hygiene starts at home and now we need to take it to classrooms.”

Lawrence offers these tips for parents:

Put glitter on your child’s hands and let them play with a few toys. After a few minutes, together with your child, examine where the glitter is – all over the toys and likely their face and body. Explain that germs will stick to everything, just like glitter, and that is why washing hands thoroughly is important.

Remind your child to sing “Happy Birthday” twice before they finish washing their hands.

Be sure to teach them to rub their fingertips during hand washing.

To help children avoid touching their face, keep hair shorter or put long hair in a ponytail to reduce the temptation to adjust hair and touch face.

Consider using sunglass lanyards on masks for younger children to avoid having them get dropped or lost.

Let your children pick a personalized mask so it feels less clinical and reflects their individuality and personal style.

Rules of the road

B.C.’s ambulance paramedics are also reminding drivers to respect school-zone speed limits and watch for children who don’t necessarily know the rules of the road. Also, parents need to be vigilant and patient during drop-offs and pick-ups.

“Never call your child from across the road because your child may assume it is safe to cross,” said Lawrence.

Here are some tips for students:

Be visible – wear bright colours and reflective gear so others can see you

Make sure traffic has stopped and make eye contact with drivers before stepping out on the road to cross the street

When possible, walk on sidewalks or pathways. If you must walk on the road, never walk with your back to oncoming traffic.

Don’t text while walking or cycling.

If you are wearing headphones, keep one earbud out and the volume low. You need to see and hear what is going on around you."

The 54-year-old, a second-generation long-haul driver from Windsor, Ont., worried his exposure while transporting whiskey and wine between Quebec and Kentucky would risk his own health as well as his family's.

""It's always in the back of my mind. I've got a wife at home that's asthmatic, I've got a daughter that's asthmatic"" — both of whom help take care of his 80-year-old father and 94-year-old father-in-law — he said.

""There's still an underlying stress there,"" Wye said in an interview from a truck stop in Cornwall, Ont. ""You find yourself some days just staring at the sky, counting to 10 and screaming every once in a while.""

Wye has stayed on the road — eating almost exclusively in his cab from March through June to avoid potential exposure in public venues — but many big-riggers closer to retirement age have opted to park their tractors due to health concerns.

As the coronavirus mushrooms across the U.S., their absence has thrown up an additional barrier to fleets scrambling to meet demand for essential goods while aggravating fears of a longer-term driver shortage.

Higher demand for essential goods and food products is fuelling growth at a handful of companies, such as International Truckload Services Inc., which has nearly 600 trucks and counting.

""For anyone that's hauling essential items, we're busy, busy, busy,"" said Monty Chrysler, head of recruitment and training at the Belleville, Ont.-based outfit, which largely ships paper towels and diapers these days. ""We're bringing on new trucks all the time. We're very lucky.""

But many trucking schools remain closed, so new recruits are unavailable. Meanwhile about 35 of Chrysler's drivers have asked to take a leave of absence or stay on this side of the border.

""These are usually older drivers, getting into their late 60s early 70s, that are really feeling vulnerable,"" he said.

Many truckers have exited the sector voluntarily.

""The concern employers were raising there was, 'Have we lost these drivers for good?'"" said Angela Splinter, who heads trade group Trucking HR Canada.

While companies specializing in short-haul delivery, groceries or medical supplies struggle to find workers, those focusing on long-haul or business-to-business shipments find themselves shrinking with the economy. Firms that ship automotive parts and manufactured goods ground to a halt amid the broader economic contraction last spring.

""It was much like feast or famine,"" Splinter said.

More than three-quarters of employers have laid off workers due to COVID-19, according to a June survey by her trade group.

Employment in the trucking and logistics sector contracted by about 10 per cent or 72,000 jobs — drivers accounted for roughly one in two of those — in the first half of 2020 due to the pandemic.

The resulting sales decline will cost the industry an estimated $3.2 billion this year, said a July report by the Conference Board of Canada and commissioned by Trucking HR Canada.

For Nachhattar Singh Chohan, who runs a 20-truck operation out of Mississauga, Ont., the uptick in sanitizer and food shipments hasn't made up for the loss of freight revenue he's seen in areas ranging from plastic to fertilizer and second-hand clothing.

""Business is at 50 per cent,"" said Chohan, who also operates a truck-wash at his lot, where drivers unload their concerns.

""They're feeling very scared... They eat in the truck. They sleep in the truck. They say, 'We don't want to bring disease to our families,'"" he said.

The pandemic has put pressure on an aging workforce. Up to 60 per cent of the trucking sector is older than 45 compared with 45 per cent of the Canadian workforce, according to the Conference Board of Canada.

""What we've seen is that that demographic is retiring at a faster rate during the pandemic,"" said Stephen Laskowski, head of the Canadian Trucking Alliance.

While truckers' front-line role delivering critical supplies during the pandemic has come into sharper focus, the tough work circumstances — weeks on the road, low pay at the outset — tend to fan impressions of an industry sometimes associated with unglamorous lifestyles, potentially repelling young recruits, he said.

Meanwhile the constant strain of tight delivery deadlines and health worries can take a psychological toll, leading to potential burnout.

""It was very unnerving when it first happened,"" Dave Wye said of the initial virus outbreak. ""It was very stressful. ‘How serious is this? Are we going to die?'""

A substantial recovery is at least six months away, said Chrysler.

""I think most of us thought we'd be over the hump by now, but really we're just knee-deep into it...I don't like to preach doom and gloom but I think that's the reality.

""It's a changing world, for sure, and I'm not sure it'll ever go back to the way it was.""

Columbus and Toronto each rallied from three-goal deficits during their preliminary round series.
""It would’ve been a good day for us to get out with them, but hey, that didn’t happen,"" Bowness said.","The hotels might be posh, their amenities and service first rate, and yet life inside the NHL’s two playoff bubbles isn’t exactly glamorous.

Having spent nearly a month cooped up at the tunnel-connected hotel-arena complex in Edmonton, Alberta, Rick Bowness acknowledged there’s times he’s had to coax himself to step outside to bask in the sun and breathe in some fresh, nonfiltered air.

article continues below

""If people think living in a bubble is great, it’s tough. It’s mentally tough. And everyone’s making the best of it,"" the Stars interim coach said after Dallas advanced to the second round with Game 6 victory over Calgary last week.

""It’s not your typical playoffs. It’s not, where, OK, you play, you jump in your car and you go home or whatever. It’s none of that. It’s play, go back to your room,"" Bowness said, beginning to laugh. ""This isn’t as easy as you think it is.""

Bowness emphasized he wasn’t complaining, but simply noting the challenges that come with the NHL’s most unusual playoffs, which haven’t yet reached the halfway mark in a bid to award the Stanley Cup by early October — or sooner.

""Listen,"" he said. ""Until you live in this, you have no idea what we’re doing, what we’re going through.""

The potential for NHL bubble fatigue is real.

The close confines, daily COVID-19 testing, lack of freedom to venture beyond the security fences surrounding hotels and arenas in Edmonton and Toronto, and the separation from loved ones can weigh heavily on everyone. Teams have access to outdoor stadiums in both cities, and the NHL has arranged golf outings on off days, in which players are bused to and from the facilities with no access to those outside the bubble.

""It’s hard when you’re in that type of environment because it’s almost like you’re in prison,"" Blackhawks general manager Stan Bowman said after Chicago was eliminated by Colorado in five games in the first round.

""When the pandemic hit, you could still leave your house, you could walk outside and get some fresh air,"" Bowman added. ""But here, I think it’s the mental toll that you’re kind of trapped. You can’t go anywhere. And over time, it does start to get to you.""

Arizona Coyotes coach Rick Tocchet noted the bubble-related challenges during his team’s three-week stay, which ended with back-to-back 7-1 losses to Colorado.

""It's basically monotonous every day. We had 2 1/2 blocks with nothing to really do other than hockey. This is where mental will comes in,"" Tocchet said. ""The teams that go far, obviously you got to have the talent. But you also have to have the strong mental fortitude to get through that for sure.""

NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly wrote in an email to The Associated Press that the league is ""actively trying to minimize the length"" of the playoffs ""in part due to the dynamics and constraints of ‘bubble life.’""

That was evident Friday, when the NHL scheduled the second round of the playoffs to open before the first round was complete. And with the conference and Cup finals set for Edmonton, the two East finalists will likely have only two days to acclimate to their new surroundings upon travelling from Toronto.

""We will continue to pursue all ‘move up’ opportunities aggressively as we go forward,"" Daly wrote.

He added the NHL is still checking with health authorities on whether family members will be allowed to enter the bubble before or during the conference finals.

In noting the bubble challenges, Boston Bruins forward Brad Marchand said players can also use them as motivation.

""We’re all sacrificing to be here, so I think the drive is there to want to make it all worth it,"" Marchand said.

""So when you get on the ice, you want to win, because otherwise this whole thing is for nothing,"" he said. ""It’ll be worth it if we win. So it’s that fear of losing, I guess, that kind of drains you mentally, and being away from the family.""

Teams arrived at their hub cities on July 26, before playing an exhibition game, followed by a two-part preliminary round. The bottom 16 teams competed in a best-of-five elimination series, while each conference’s top four teams played a round-robin tournament to determine seeding.

The first round began on Aug 11 and lasted just 11 days.

There were no series sweeps in the first round for just the fourth time since the 2005 lockout, with no series going the maximum seven games — the first time that’s happened in the first round since 2001.

Overall, a combined 43 games were played, which matched the second-lowest total since 41 games were needed to complete the first round in 2000.

Though it’s unclear what those numbers reflect, Bowness said the notable momentum swings within a series or even a game were ""absolutely"" the result of life in the bubble.

Columbus and Toronto each rallied from three-goal deficits during their preliminary round series. Dallas did the same in a series-deciding 7-3 win over the Flames.

""The way we’re living and playing, that’s going to lead to a lot of emotional swings,"" Bowness said. ""Give our guys credit, they battled back.""

In a bid to break the monotony, Bowness scheduled a mandatory fun day for the Stars at Edmonton’s Commonwealth Stadium on Friday.

""We need to get out of the hotel. We need a mental break,"" he said.

The players repaid Bowness with a 5-3 series-opening win over Colorado a day later. The only drawback was Bowness and his staff couldn’t join them because they had to spend Friday at the hotel prepping for the Avalanche.

""It would’ve been a good day for us to get out with them, but hey, that didn’t happen,"" Bowness said. ""And we knew when we came into this bubble, you roll with the punches.""

That’s why getting a flu shot this fall is “more important than ever,” according to Dr. Ran Goldman, a professor at UBC’s faculty of medicine and pediatrician at BC Children’s Hospital.

“When you have another virus circulating like COVID-19, the risks that people will have to take on themselves not being immunized are going to be larger,” he said.

“I think by immunizing against influenza we’re at least reducing and mitigating some of the concerns... Also, the symptoms are going to be quite similar – it’s going to be really hard to differentiate between the two, and with that, it’s going to be a public health concern.”

Once someone has a viral infection, their immune system is reduced to a point where they can catch other infections, said Goldman, so, someone with the flu could catch COVID-19 – and vice versa – or catch both viruses at the same time, based on early reports from China.

Furthermore, a viral infection could also expose the immune system to a bacterial infection, putting people at an even higher risk of complications, including pneumonia or blood infections.

“So having any of those viruses, not to mention both, does expose you to more immune-related conditions and complications, including death,” said Goldman.

“That’s the danger we’re facing. And if we do have a way to mitigate one of them, such as influenza…we should try, please, to do that.”

People who are already immunocompromised, such as those with chronic illnesses or older individuals, would also be at higher risk being exposed to more than one virus.

Testing will also need to increase to a point where the province can respond to any local epidemics, said Goldman.

Earlier this week, Vancouver Coastal Health announced it was expanding hours at test sites in Richmond and Vancouver, where it also opened a new assessment centre. The province is also working on increasing its capacity and is hiring 500 more contact tracers ahead of the fall.

In a recent study, surveying nearly 3,000 families across six countries, Goldman found that more parents – 54 per cent – plan to vaccinate their children against the flu this year. That’s an increase of 16 per cent from last year. But, he said, it's important to reach the other half of parents still on the fence about vaccinating against the flu.

Immunizing is especially important as children return to in-class instruction this fall, as there could be greater spread of both influenza and COVID-19, said Goldman.

“So if we immunize children against it (the flu), we may reduce the risk for themselves, but also for their parents and grandparents and the community.”

Goldman also said that the public health measures in place against COVID-19 – including school cohorts, hand-washing, social distancing and staying home if you have any symptoms – may reduce the risk, “but not eliminate it.”

“By that, I mean there’s still going to be epidemics locally of both influenza – and likely of COVID-19 – just like every year.”

Goldman said he believes B.C. was “very fortunate” to flatten its curve earlier this year, but people will still need to follow health measures heading into the fall and upcoming flu season to ensure the curve remains as flat as possible and hospitals aren’t overloaded.

The flu vaccine is typically available around October, coinciding with the start of the influenza season which runs until March, although that can vary depending on weather, how active people are, and where epidemics start, said Goldman.

And while he said it will be “interesting” to see how the flu season unfolds this year – with some speculating that it may not be as bad given social distancing and increased hand washing, for example – Goldman said he wants to make sure people are protected.

“It’s hard to know when it’s going to hit the most, but we need to be ready the minute it comes at our doors.”"

Blair, a mother of two, is a teacher and education assistant at Stein Valley Nlakapamux School, a First Nations registered independent school near Lytton, B.C., which resumed classes nearly a month ago.

The Ministry of Education said the school is the first in B.C. among public and independent schools to have started the 2020 to 2021 school year.

The school operates on a year-round schedule, with extended breaks for students and teachers four times a year, which line up with culturally significant times for the Nlaka'pamux Nation.

Stein Valley Nlakapamux School has been in session for four weeks, with the first three weeks allowing students to attend on alternating days to reduce class sizes. Full classes resumed last week, and the current semester is set to run until Oct. 2.

The Nlaka'pamux Nation hasn't seen any COVID-19 cases to date.

Blair is a kindergarten teacher and special education assistant at the school, where her kids are in kindergarten and Grade 3.

She said she was concerned about the kids' ability to follow physical distancing guidelines and other COVID-19 protocols.

""It's a scary time to be making the decision to be taking your kid back to school or not,"" she said. ""I'm so thankful that we have the ability to have such small class sizes and have all these extra precautions in place so my kids and my family are safe.""

School administrator Edith Loring-Kuhanga said the school was running through its reopening plan before the Ministry of Education had released its own initial COVID-19 guidelines at the end of July and into early August.

Teachers are set to return to B.C. public schools on Sept. 8, with students reporting to classes two days later.

""We had to just kind of create our own (guidelines). It was a little bit nerve-racking,"" said Loring-Kuhanga. ""Some of the parents and the staff were concerned we were going to be guinea pigs ... and what if it fails?""

The school decided to take as many safety precautions as it could, she said.

Students are screened three times before entering a classroom, personal protective equipment is available to the 40 staff members and each classroom was cleared out to allow for greater physical distancing.

School staff went through the province's latest guidelines line-by-line and found that they're doing more than what is required, said Loring-Kahuna.

""Our board has been very adamant that they dont just want us to meet the standards, they want us to exceed them,"" she said.

Despite staff worries over children understanding the new reality of COVID-19 safety measures, Blair said students have been quick to follow the new guidelines.

Parents across the province have expressed concern about the safety of schools when they reopen, and while Blair says she understands those worries, she urged parents to trust teachers.

""Parents need to trust that teachers and the staff at schools are going to be working their very hardest to follow the protocols and do the very best they can to keep everyone safe,"" she said. ""Everybody is doing their best. Mistakes might be made but that's how we learn and we can correct the mistakes as we go.

But she added that the Ministry of Education should be stricter on class sizes when class resumes to better manage safety concerns.

In a statement, the Ministry of Education notes that First Nations independent schools are exempt from the provincial government's requirements to fully open.

""The health and safety of teachers, students and staff is our top priority,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""The government's restart plan enables schools to deliver learning within the BCCDC’s comprehensive health and safety requirements.""

Early Sunday, Victoria police fined a party guest at a Fort Street apartment suite $230 for violating the COVID-19 Related Measures Act.

The 18-year-old male guest refused to co-operate and leave when police broke the party up, said Const. Cam MacIntyre.

“It’s disappointing and frustrating,” MacIntyre said. “It’s incredibly reckless.”

Officers were called to the multi-unit residential building in the 1000 block of Fort Street for a noise disturbance.

Patrol officers arrested the man for obstructing a peace officer and served him with a $200 violation ticket under the COVID-19 Related Measures Act “for abusive or belligerent behaviour at a social gathering,” plus a $30 victim surcharge levy.

The guest was released at the scene and left the area, police said. No additional violation tickets were issued, MacIntyre said.

Police said 15 people were at the party — too many to allow for physical distancing, MacIntyre said, but far fewer than on Friday night, when an estimated 40 to 60 youth were packed inside the one-bedroom suite.

The room was so crowded and hot Friday there was condensation on the windows and the party attendees were sweating, police said.

The host, a young adult male who had been warned previously by police, was issued a $2,000 fine, plus a $300 victim-surcharge levy.

Victoria police will now be monitoring the resident of this suite, MacIntyre said. Further violations could result in more significant tickets and even criminal charges of mischief.

Police can recommend charges if violation tickets do not prove to be effective deterrents, or in cases of egregious contraventions or for repeat offenders. On conviction, penalties of up to $10,000 may be levied, according to the province.

“We are not going to tolerate this kind of behaviour,” MacIntyre said. “It’s unacceptable as it puts public health at risk.”

About 45 minutes prior to attending the party Sunday morning, police officers were at the scene of a violent robbery, MacIntyre said. These are the types of calls that police need to focus on rather than fining people who can’t practise “simple consideration” for others during a pandemic, he said.

Under orders issued by the provincial health officer, organizers and hosts of events must ensure physical distancing of two metres between guests, take names and addresses of all attendees, and provide hand sanitiation amongst other provisions. Gatherings are limited to 50 people or fewer.

This is the sixth straight month when the province’s legal cannabis retailers have sold a record-high value of products.

A similar trend is happening nationwide, although the year-over-year rise in sales is not as substantial as it is in B.C.

Canadian legal cannabis retailers sold more than $201 million worth of cannabis in June, which is about 119% more than the nearly $91.7 million in cannabis sales that the nation’s cannabis retailers sold in the same month a year ago.

Many of the reasons that June sales soared are the same as those for why sales surged in March, when BIV last examined the significant rise in cannabis sales, and the government revenue that comes with those increased sales.

They are:

•more legal stores;

•fewer black-market stores;

•newly legal product categories, such as edibles; and

•improved product quality.

One thing that has changed since March in B.C. is that the government now allows legal private retailers to conduct e-commerce transactions, although customers must still pick up their purchase at physical stores, and not have the products delivered.

B.C. had issued 135 retail licences to entrepreneurs who wanted to open cannabis stores in October, 2019, just before the one year-anniversary of Canada legalizing adult-use cannabis consumption.

That number leaped to 176 by the end of 2019 and then to 254 by May 27, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth told BIV on May 27.

The province’s website on August 21 listed 264 licences granted for retail cannabis stores.

Sales for cannabis in B.C. have risen in each month sequentially since January, after sales had suffered a slight dip in December.

B.C. ranked fourth among provinces for cannabis sales in June, behind:

Glenlyon Norfolk does not have a boarding school for international students, who live with the parents of other GNS students, said head of school Chad Holtum.

Before moving in with the local families, 21 students coming from other countries will be quarantined in a boarding house in Victoria. The school educates children from kindergarten to Grade 12, but Holtum said the students in quarantine are in high school.

Students will be met at the airport by GNS staff and taken to the boarding house, which will be supervised around the clock by support staff. Students will be given three meals a day and can participate in online orientation programs to keep them busy.

Holtum said the school is following guidelines from the federal government, which lay out how food is delivered, what programs can take place and when students can leave their rooms to get some fresh air.

Staff will also be checking in to make sure students are not feeling isolated.

“There is a piece where we have to talk to kids about mental health and what they’re going through and we want to support every element of that,” Holtum said. “When everyone is safe and healthy, we will introduce the international students to their host family.”

International students make up 12 per cent of Glenlyon Norfolk’s student population of about 700, he said. About 15 or 16 international students were not able to get visas to study in Canada due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, he said.

Brookes Westshore, an international baccalaureate boarding school in Colwood, has about 20 students currently in quarantine on campus, said head of school Jerry Salvador. There are separate quarantine floors for boys and girls, monitored by a house parent.

When students want to get some exercise and fresh air, they walk around the courtyard with the house parent six feet away.

Salvador admits it’s a bit sad seeing the students do their solitary laps around the courtyard.

“They isolated but they’re not alone,” he said. “The kids have been fabulous at respecting [the quarantine rules]. They know this is serious. They appreciate that this is what they have to do to be safe.”

The school serves 300 students, 150 of whom are boarding students. Of those, about 120 are typically from outside Canada. This year, only about 60 to 70 international students are expected, Salvador said.

“The fact that we just can’t get study permits for new students has really affected us,” he said. Salvador also said some students have had trouble finding flights from their home country to Canada. The school has had to layoff three positions as a result of the loss in revenue.

“This has definitely been a challenging year — but it’s a challenging year for everybody,” Salvador said.

Brentwood College expects its international students will be arriving by Monday to start their two-week quarantine in a downton Victoria hotel.

At a cost of $2,000, students can stay in a room at the Hilton’s DoubleTree hotel in downtown Victoria, where they will be chaperoned at all times.

According to the college’s quarantine plan, students will be greeted at the airport by Brentwood staff and transported to their quarantine residence. They will be provided three meals a day, undergo daily health checks, have daily visits from staff and have the option for daily physical activities or online orientation meetings.

Private school students can expect in-person classes to operate under the same protocols set for public schools by the Ministry of Education: physical distancing, regular cleaning, hand washing and the use of masks when physical distancing isn’t possible. Like public schools, private schools will operate cohorts of up to 60 students for elementary and middle school students and up to 120 students in high school.

At St. Michaels University School, boarding houses will be arranged as separate cohorts of students who will be allowed to be in close contact. Visitors won’t be allowed in boarding houses during the first few weeks of school.

SMUS says boarding rooms are laid out to allow maximum distancing between roommates and each room has its own bathroom. Meal times in the dining hall will be staggered and students in cohorts will eat together.

Any boarding student who exhibits COVID-19 symptoms will be placed in an isolation ward which is physically separated from the rest of the boarding house until their test results determine whether they’re healthy enough to return to the school community.

If rising case numbers prompt public health officials to recommend that schools suspend in-person classes and switch to online learning, SMUS said boarding school students will remain isolated together on campus.

With the number of new novel coronavirus cases rising throughout the province, the B.C. Ministry of Health announced earlier this week that it would be ramping up its number of assessment centres following delays and long lineups at some COVID-19 testing locations.

There were 50 new active cases of COVID-19 in the North Shore-Coast Garibaldi health region, as of Aug. 20.

The B.C. Centre for Disease Control now releases regional stats on diagnoses of the virus every two weeks. Much like the rest of the province, the North Shore region has seen its caseload spike, in this case, almost double the previous reporting period.

“The new North Vancouver COVID-19 assessment centre is the second to open this week in the region and will help ensure that assessment and testing is broadly available to people experiencing symptoms, when they need it,” stated Health Minister Adrian Dix, in a press release from VCH.

Since the pandemic began, there have been 338 confirmed cases in the region, which includes North and West Vancouver, Whistler, Squamish and the Sea to Sky corridor plus the Sunshine Coast and Powell River.

A new testing site was opened in the parking lot of Vancouver Community College in Vancouver earlier this week, while the hours at a COVID-19 testing centre in Richmond were expanded.

The new testing site will be particularly important to the North Shore’s current response to COVID-19 by taking some of the pressure off of the Urgent and Primary Care Centre on Esplanade, according to North Vancouver-Lonsdale MLA Bowinn Ma.

The care centre, which opened in November 2019, was particularly important during the height of the pandemic when many clinics were closed to in-person visits and the centre also helped relieve some of the burden put on the busy Lions Gate Hospital emergency room, said Ma.

“We do know that a substantial number of patients who visit the Urgent and Primary Care Centre are there for COVID-19 testing. I think that a lot of these patients will likely prefer a faster walk-in, drive-through experience,” said Ma. “They have been experiencing quite a lot of pressure and this additional testing site will definitely be able to help separate some of the caseloads that the Urgent and Primary Care Centre is getting.”

Ma also praised how quickly VCH and other North Shore community partners were able to transform the Centennial Theatre parking lot into a COVID-19 assessment centre.

In a few short hours, the Centennial Theatre parking lot in @CityOfNorthVan was transformed into a #COVID19 assessment centre to serve residents of the North Shore. Here's how it was done.



Hint: It took a lot of help from our amazing community partners. pic.twitter.com/IcWtc5cOxp — Vancouver Coastal Health (@VCHhealthcare) August 22, 2020

The new North Vancouver COVID-19 assessment centre will be open daily from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. and can be accessed on Lonsdale Avenue from 23rd Street, according to VCH.

People visiting the test site do not need a referral or appointment and will be seen on a first-come, first-serve basis. Presenting a BC Services Card and wearing a face mask will be required, however.

Assessment for testing will be conducted on visitors experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, which can include fever, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, and others.

B.C. Ferries is ramping up its COVID-19 requirements, which have so far only required passengers to wear masks if they were within two metres of another person.

Under the new rules, all passengers must wear masks or face coverings at terminals and while on board vessels.

Anyone not complying with the rules can be banned from travel, said Mark Collins, B.C. Ferries president and chief executive, on Friday.

“B.C. Ferries’ priority is the health and safety of our employees and customers,” he said. “We urge and expect our customers to behave responsibly when they are travelling with us.”

Face coverings are not required inside vehicles or while consuming food or beverages, provided people are maintaining physical distance.

Others exemptions include anyone with an underlying medical condition or disability that inhibits their ability to wear a mask, those who are unable to put a mask on or take it off without help, and children younger than two years old.

The rules covers B.C. Ferries workers as well, with the exception of those who work behind physical barriers or who are in employee-only areas.

On B.C. Transit, the new rules are more about education than enforcement.

“If somebody gets onto the bus and is not wearing a face covering, we are making the assumption that they meet one of our exemption criteria,” spokesman Jonathon Dyck said.

Children under five and people who can’t wear a face covering for health reasons will be among those who are exempt.

Similar education-based policies have been brought in by other transit systems, Dyck said.

“We’re following their lead,” he said. “They saw success with it, implementing it in this manner. We’re hoping that we’ll see the same success here in B.C. Transit communities.”

Bus riders are expected to provide their own face coverings. Transit drivers do not have to wear a face covering if they are behind a barrier.

Dyck said customers have been asking for a face-covering regulation, and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has said it is something that should be considered.

“We want to make the bus as comfortable a place as possible for people.”"

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""","INVERMAY, Sask. — People could always tell when Aaron Ogden entered a room.

The 19-year-old had a big presence, said his father, Mark Ogden. He was a prankster, a one-of-a-kind character who would sit and talk to anybody as if he'd known them for years.

article continues below

""He wasn't afraid to make friends,"" Ogden, 50, said in a phone interview. ""This is just the way he was.

""Really easy to talk to.""

People remembered the young man's outgoing personality at his funeral this week. He died in a Calgary hospital last Saturday after collapsing on a run.

His father, a trucker, was able to be by his son's side.

He said a major blood clot had formed around a stent placed in his son's aorta. The stent was necessary after he survived a serious highway accident on his way to work last year.

""It was a miracle, really.""

Ogden said while in hospital before his death, his son told him he was supposed to go for a CT scan in June while still living in Saskatchewan near Yorkton.

It was a routine checkup on the stent, but the appointment was postponed because of restrictions around the COVID-19 pandemic and never rescheduled.

""I didn't think nothing of it at the time, but I mulled it over ... as we watched him decline,"" Ogden said.

""It hit me. He was trying to tell me: 'This shouldn't have happened.'""

The father believes that had his son's scan not been cancelled, doctors might have found the blood clot in time.

Ogden wants all postponed hospital procedures done immediately.

""People's lives are being lost,"" he said. ""These COVID rules are way too far.""

Ogden believes the Saskatchewan Health Authority bears responsibility for his son's death.

""Somebody needs to be held to account.""

The health authority halted hundreds of non-urgent surgeries, procedures and diagnostics in March to brace for the pandemic.

Two months later, when the government felt it had a handle on the spread of the novel coronavirus, it announced the resumption of health services would be staggered.

""Emergency and urgent patients are the priority for services, including diagnostic imaging,"" said Corey Miller, vice-president of provincial programs at the health authority.

""The determination of the priority is based on the evaluation of the referring physician in consultation with the patient.""

Miller said they are reviewing Ogden's case and have reached out to his family.

He said the health authority is working through the backlog of exams that were delayed during the first few months of the pandemic.

More than 1,500 CT appointments which had been booked were postponed, he said.

Ogden questions why something like a CT scan couldn't be performed in Yorkton, where the risk of COVID-19 was low.

As of Friday, health officials reported five active cases in the region, which has only seen 33 infections in total since the pandemic hit Saskatchewan.

Cheryl Camillo, a professor with the University of Regina's Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy, says speaking generally, delaying non-essential services to respond to COVID-19 was the responsible thing to do because the virus was new and spreading quickly.

""The risks are that some people don't get the essential and urgent services because so much of the workforce and the resources of the health system move towards responding to COVID,"" said the health systems researcher.

""It's very human for people to get frustrated because health care is something that is so personal.""

She says another risk of scaling back is that people can lose confidence in a health system some may perceive as having overplanned for the pandemic.

Health officials are in the tough spot of having to prepare for the worst case scenario and what could be a rapid change in case numbers, she says.

During the pandemic Camillo's own grandmother died in a long-term care home in the United States from isolation and depression, she says.

""I suffered an individual loss of my otherwise pretty healthy grandmother, but despite how profoundly sad that makes me, I understand and would defend the care home's decision to lock down.

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""

The 50-plus employees, mainly women, are program or unit clerks. They collect and handle documentation others have handled, some of them in pandemic units.

They work throughout the health authority – in hospitals large and small, home health, primary care, palliative care, rapid access clinics, emergency departments and renal, pre-transplant and post-transplant units, among many others.

And, they don’t want to handle paper that has moved through many different units, fearing the virus could be present.

Group spokeswoman Ashley Cau said moving to a fully digital system would change things. But, she added, many health care workers don’t want to take the time to scan documentation.

“Our health is less important than their convenience,” Cau said. “Some nurses are very respectful.”

She and her colleagues are the ones who handle timesheets, handle vacation scheduling and finding replacements for people who can't come in.

“It’s kind of crazy that in 2020 that everything’s not digital,” she said.

A series of emails between the clerks and staffing services leader Shauna Doughty show some workers have young children, elderly parents or other immune-compromised relatives at home. They fear exposure at work could be harmful to their loved ones.

They question with remote working already established, why FHA would demand they return to potentially threatening workplaces – especially with COVID-19 numbers on the rise.

Cau said some health care workers are not wearing masks, and not socially distancing. Each unit has differing operational rules, she said.

Further, the processing problems are causing an already-back-up payroll system to become further clogged, affecting the whole region.

It all scares the clerks, Cau said.

And, they’re all concerns Fraser Health chief medical health officer Dr. Elizabeth Brodkin takes seriously.

“I totally understand and respect the concerns of the unit clerks,” Brodkin said.

But, she stressed, paper is not a vector for virus transmission.

“I am not dismissing their concerns,” Brodkin added.

That aside, Brodkin said use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and social distancing is mandatory in health facilities.

“If an individual is observing that this practice is not being followed, they should address it to their manager so it can be addressed,” Brodkin said.

However, Brodkin said, there are times in health care when social distancing is not possible.

“That’s why PPE including masks is mandatory in those areas,” Brodkin said.

On digitization, Brodkin said the region is moving in that direction.

“Health care extraordinarily complex and there is a lot of documentation to go with it,” she said.

An August 17 email to the workers, Doughty said mixed use of from-home and workplace-based clerks was planned.

“Starting in September, we will be moving forward with establishing set work schedules that will include specific days of the week that you will be required to work onsite,” Doughty wrote.

She said the practice of scanning and sending some documents would stop and return to staff services.

The Hospital Employees Union acknowledged a request for information but provided no information on the situation.

The guides include tips for getting together with friends, visiting restaurants, playing recreational sports, going on road trips or to the beach – and COVID-safe sex.

""We want people to get out and enjoy summer with their friends, but we can’t forget that COVID-19 is still in our communities,” said VCH’s Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Patricia Daly.

The campaign was launched in response to the rise in COVID-19 cases in B.C., particularly in people under the age of 40.

“The 60-plus age group now represents 16 per cent of our cases, while those aged 20 to 39 make up 56 per cent of our cases,” said Daly.

That’s a switch from the first months of the pandemic, when 43 per cent of B.C.’s cases were in the 60-plus age group, she said.

VCH data shows that the median age for those who test positive for COVID-19 has now dropped, from 57 years old in Phase 1 of B.C.’s Restart Plan to 34 years old in Phase 3.

Daly said the reasons for the shift in demographic are varied, but include the reopening of businesses that tend to employ younger adults, such as restaurants and bars.

But another reason for the shift is parties.

“We’re seeing transmission take place in nightclubs in particular, but also at bars and restaurants, while boating and other indoor social settings,” said Daly.

“It’s the way people act and interact in these settings that’s problematic: sharing food and drinks, speaking loudly and in close proximity if there’s background noise, and not social distancing among strangers, especially if they’ve been drinking alcohol.”

There are dozens of words used to describe cheese, but no matter which ones you prefer, one I use a lot is “love.”

I know I’m not alone in my love affair of all things cheese, so I decided to create a “cheese trail,” which includes some favourite dairies, creameries and shops between Vancouver and Harrison Hot Springs.

The Fraser Valley has become famous for producing high-quality goats cheese at local farms. These friendly goats greet visitors at Milner Valley Cheese in Langley. Photo Sandra Thomas

I created the trail in such a way that cheese lovers can choose the road trip that best suits their schedule, whether that’s a couple of hours, a day or a weekend. This was our first road trip since COVID-19 and it was such a relief to travel again, though we followed Dr. Bonnie Henry's advice and safety protocals along the way.

There are already popular Circle Farm tours offered across Langley, Abbotsford, Chilliwack, Agassiz and Harrison Hot Springs, but their focus includes everything from produce to cheese and coffee to berries.

This self-guided tour narrows that focus down to mostly cheese, with the odd glass of wine thrown in. Keep in mind that due to COVID, some hours of operation and the way these owners conduct business may have changed, so make sure to check out their websites or give them a call before heading out.

You can do this self-guided cheese tour of Vancouver in an afternoon.

(Many Vancouver cheese shops are also offering delivery and curb-side pickup during this time.)

Benton Brothers Fine Cheese

1689 Johnston St., Granville Island

This family owned cheese shop was created by brothers who made the transition from engineers to cheesemongers in 2007.

Benton Brothers Fine Cheese offers an ever-changing selection of artisanal, small production and farmhouse cheeses with no artificial flavours, cut-to-order and fresh off the wheel.

es amis du FROMAGE

1752 West Second Ave.

843 East Hastings St.

Also family owned and operated, these specialty cheese stores offer a carefully curated selection of local and imported cheeses, charcuterie and accompaniments.

Founded in 1985, les amis du FROMAGE has been voted “Best Cheese Shop” by readers of the Courier, Georgia Straight and Westender — and has been awarded Vancouver Magazine’s Restaurant Award for Top Food Supplier to Vancouver’s best restaurants and hotels.

Blue Heron Creamery

2408 Main St.

Got milk? Actually, no they don’t.

Chef Karen McAthy wants to redefine the definition of what exactly makes up “cheese.”

Instead of using dairy, McAthy and her team at Blue Heron culture fats and proteins from nut milks, including coconut, walnuts, almonds and cashews.

The results are delicious, vegan, plant-based cheeses you’d be proud to include on any charcuterie platter.

La Grotta Del Formaggio

1791 Commercial Dr.

Probably most famous for their sandwiches, this Commercial Drive institution is also popular for its charcuterie offerings, including a vast choice of domestic and international cheeses.

Bosa Foods

1465 Kootenay St.

562 Victoria Drive

With more than 400 varieties of both domestic and international cheeses, Bosa Foods is the place to search out traditional hard, aged cheeses such as Parmigiano Reggiano (the king of Italian cheese), Grana Padano, Pecorino Romano, Provolone, Asiago, Piave, and Montasio.

Overnight or weekend road trip from Vancouver

Yes, you’ll have to cross a bridge or take a tunnel to get out of the city, but once you try some of the decadent cheeses you’ll find across Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley, you’ll thank me.

Scardillo Cheese

Scardillo Cheese embraces the spirit of the “100 Mile Diet” and uses Canadian milk from local producers.

Open since 1959, Scardillo is the largest independent cheese producer in B.C.

Did you know that Windsor Meats started a deli specializing in charcuterie?

Me either.

But, in 2017 Windsor Meats purchased Beast and Brine in South Surrey as a way to compliment the meats sold at their butcher shops and to take charcuterie to a whole other level.

Beast and Brine can also provide cheese trays for parties and events up to 20 people.

Milner Valley Cheese

The farmhouse cheese made at Milner Valley Cheese or, as I like to call it, goat cheese heaven on earth, offers all natural and handcrafted products made from the long-eared Nubian and Alpines goats, both known for their rich milk quality, and the pure white Saanen, the Holstein of the herd.

Milner Valley Cheese is sold at the Farmgate Shop at Smith Heritage House, which is open Tuesday to Saturday. Photo Sandra Thomas

The herd is fed by rotational grazing of the adjacent fields, quality grain and hay and no artificial preservatives or additives are used.

Go for the cheese, stay to pet the goats.

I’ve had the opportunity to try several cheeses created by Jason Dykstra of Mt. Lehman Cheese and I’d be hard pressed to choose a favourite, though the Blue Capri goat’s cheese ranks right at the top.

Jason gained a passion and knowledge that goes into making quality goat milk from growing up in the industry, which is where his cheese starts.

The goat milk is sourced from Mystery Meadows Farm in Agassiz, while the water buffalo milk comes from a small herd in Langley.

Singletree Winery

OK, not exactly a creamery, but they do sell local cheese, including products from Mt. Lehman Cheese Co. and Smits and Co. from Chilliwack.

Plus, wine! Their vineyard and tasting room are located on a 67-acre operating farm, just 45-minutes from Vancouver.

Their licensed picnic area is gorgeous and the perfect spot to unwind with a glass of wine, maybe even their Siegerrebe and brand new Grüner Veltliner.

Singletree is owned and operated by the Etsell family, who has deep roots in the farmlands of Fraser Valley.

This award-winning hotel was recently named Top Small Hotel and Most Romantic Hotel in Canada by TripAdvisor travellers.

Inspired by romantic movies, each themed suite is decorated to capture the film’s essence and comes complete with a copy of that movie in your room for viewing.

We stayed in the Midnight in Paris suite, located on the top floor of the three-storey Tudor-style inn, and our room came with a large deck that overlooked a vineyard on one side.

Besides Midnight in Paris, other suites available are inspired by Under the Tuscan Sun, The Secret Garden, A Good Year in the Vineyard, Thomas Crown Affair and Roman Holiday.

Even the dining room has a theme and is inspired by the classic film Breakfast at Tiffany's. Speaking of breakfast, topped with fresh berries ours was almost too gorgeous to eat. We chose to enjoy our breakfast outside on our deck instead of the dining room to enjoy the sunny morning and view.

Where to eat in Abbotsford

Field House Brewing

You have got to check out Field House Brewing, set in an industrial area of Abbotsford.

With vintage-style lawn chairs spread across their greenspace, the possibility for Instagram-worthy photos are endless.

The Field House menu showcases the best of the Fraser Valley and while the menu isn’t overly complicated, its simplicity works because it highlights local, farm-fresh ingredients. I swear this is the first time my husband has ever ordered a salad at a brew pub — and he loved it.

The menu at Field House focuses on farm-to-table ingredients. Photo Sandra Thomas

The beer menu is interesting and options include their Kiwi & Tequila Golden Sour, New World Hazy Double IPA and Syrah Wild Farmhouse Ale, among others.

Weekend getaway

For a cheese-lover’s weekend, I recommend splitting up your visits over a couple of days with stops of your choice from the entire list ending in Harrison Mills and saving some locations for the return trip.

Birchwood Dairy Farm

1154 Fadden Rd., Abbotsford

Birchwood Dairy is popular for all of its dairy products, particularly its cheese and ice cream. Photo Sandra Thomas

Birchwood Dairy Farm is a combination dairy farm, processing plant, country store and ice cream parlor.

The day we visited the sun was shining and folks of all ages were eating ice cream and relaxing in the shade of several large trees spread across the farm’s lawn.

The farm has 220 acres of land where they milk approximately 120 cows and have almost 140 young stock. Enough hay and silage are grown on the farm to feed their happy cows all year long, so it truly is local.

Among the many cheese sold at the farm store, you’ll want to try the cheddar, marble, Monterey jack, feta and cheddar curd.

Smits and Co.

5787 Lickman Rd., Chilliwack

This charming little shop is located on a small family farm less than 10-minutes off the highway.

Smits sells both cow and goat cheese and their method of production is outlined step-by-step on their website, so you know exactly what you're getting..

The Farm House Natural Cheeses

Established in 2003, Farm House Natural Cheeses produces handmade, artisan cheeses and specialties from the rich, fresh whole milk of the farm’s own dairy cows and goats.

In their on-farm cheese shop you can sample and purchase all kinds of cheese, as well as bottled cow and goat milk.

We had to buy a chunk of their Heidi cheese to try because it’s a limited edition made only from the fresh milk produced on their summer pasture giving it a flavour similar to a gruyere.

Where to eat in Harrison

Muddy Waters Café

Located directly across the street from Harrison Lake beach, we enjoyed a casual lunch on the patio of Muddy Waters and took in the view and people watching as we devoured really good ground-rib steak burgers.

Surrounded by the lush farmlands of Aggasiz and Harrison, Muddy Waters takes advantage of the local offerings and they’ve taken casual dining to a whole new farm-to-table level.

We managed to save room for dessert so stopped in at Rocky Mountain Chocolate, directly next door, for some ice cream. We also couldn’t resist picking up some Grizzly Paws for the road.

Golden Ears Cheese Crafters

22270 128th Ave., Maple Ridge

Depending on your route back to the city, Golden Ears Cheese Crafters is a must-stop.

The farm-made, artisan cheeses are unique in the fact they’re made by two young sisters, Emma and Jenna Davison, who have managed to catch the attention of some pretty high-end establishments.

Their cheeses are served everywhere from Fairmont Hotel Vancouver to Araxis Restaurant to the Rosewood Hotel Georgia.

Solicitor General Mike Farnworth announced Friday morning organizers of parties and large gatherings can be ticketed $2,000 by police – and individuals taking part can be hit with a $200 fine.

article continues below

The enforcement measures are being enacted under the provincial state of emergency and allow police and other provincial enforcement officers, for example, liquor, cannabis and gaming inspectors, community safety unit inspectors and conservation officers, to issue these tickets.

“These orders will help us put a stop to the selfish acts of a small minority of British Columbians, who are threatening to erode the progress our province has made in controlling COVID-19,” said Farnworth, who is also the Minister of Public Safety. “While I’m disappointed these measures are now necessary, I am taking this action to give police agencies and provincial enforcement officers the ability to take action against those who are putting people’s lives at risk.”

City bylaw officers haven’t had the ability to issue fines for defying provincial health orders – the one ticket issued recently in Richmond to an organizer of several basketball games was for a bylaw infraction, not for defying a provincial order, explained city spokesperson Clay Adams – and this announcement doesn’t change that.

However, Adams clarified, it does fall within their expertise.

“We have made government aware that our officers are ready to support enforcement of orders should government choose to make that happen,” he added.

The enforcement focus will be on $2,000 fines to owners, operators and organizers who contravene the provincial health officer’s order on gatherings and events, according to the announcement.

This includes hosting a private party or public event in excess of 50 people, failing to provide appropriate hand sanitation and washroom facilities, failing to provide sufficient space in the venue for physical distancing, failing to obtain a list of names and contacts at a large event or having more than five guests gathered in a vacation accommodation.

The city reported earlier this summer that organized basketball games at city parks were especially problematic and they threatened to take down the hoops if they didn’t stop. Only four players are allowed at a time to play a game of basketball.

Adams said it has been a “frustration” for the city when people flaunted the rules and safety measures.

However, he clarified, the city’s position has always been to educate rather than enforce, adding “we will continue to work with the RCMP on ensuring compliance with the public health orders where necessary.”"

“There is a small minority of selfish individuals across the province who are disregarding public health measures,” said Farnworth.

Police and the likes of liquor, gaming and conservation inspectors and officers can now fine site owners, such as businesses, or organizers of gatherings and events who contravene the provincial health officer's order on gatherings and events, which are limited to under 50 people and must provide for physical distancing and other safety measures.

Owners and organizers can face a $2,000 penalty whereas attendees who do not disperse upon request by an official can be ticketed $200, said Farnworth, adding officials will use their “discretion” on assessing if orders are being broken.

But facing media questions, it is not clear, in some instances, what constitutes a violation, nor is it clear the body of evidence that supports these new enforcement measures. Farnworth was not able to provide data on how many cases of COVID-19 have occurred as a result of explicit violations of public health orders. Nor did he provide any data on violations of orders related to occupancy limits on vacation accommodations, put in place last month.

He said most of his concern comes from large indoor gatherings, based on feedback provided by health officials. He also addressed outdoor gatherings, such as at beaches. Farnworth said in one instance an organizer asked people to come to an outdoor gathering and for people to not wear masks, which he said is a violation of orders. Mask wearing is not mandatory outdoors and B.C. health officials have stated there is little evidence such events result in spread of the disease.

Farnworth used an example of people crammed into a kitchen at a house party and said tickets could now be issued for attendees who do not disperse upon request.

There was one instance in Abbotsford of a family gathering of 30 people, where 15 people got COVID-19, in June.

Many recent outbreaks — outside of seniors’ residences, which account for a large portion of cases — have also occurred in food processing plants, as well as several restaurants and even strip clubs.

Farnworth has also empowered officials to ticket unruly customers of restaurants. Anyone declining to obey a restaurant’s guidelines or who “bullies” staff, can be ticketed for $200. It’s not clear what would constitute bullying.

According to a ministry statement, fines can be issued for “hosting a private party or public event in excess of 50 people, failing to provide appropriate hand sanitation and washroom facilities, failing to provide sufficient space in the venue for physical distancing, failing to obtain a list of names and contacts at large event or having more than five guests gathered in a vacation accommodation.”

Tickets can also be issued to “individuals who actively encourage others to attend gatherings or events that do not comply with established requirements.”

Municipal bylaw officers have not been empowered to ticket people.

Ticketing people over COVID-19 has not resulted in lower case numbers, according to a Canadian Civil Liberties Association analysis of an estimated $13 million worth of COVID-19 fines issued, to mid-June.

The analysis shows a correlation between provinces, such as B.C. (before today), that used an incentive-based or “carrot” approach to physical distancing measures and low rates of the disease.

The CCLA report asserts a punitive or “stick” approach to public health is unsuccessful, now and historically: “Trying to police our way out of this pandemic is unimaginative, sometimes unconstitutional, and ineffective.”

In March, City of Vancouver manager Sadhu Johnston had cited concerns about the infringement of citizens’ rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in ticketing individuals and taking police officers away from other, more pressing duties in the city.

“Having police officers trolling parks and ticketing people is at this point – given all of their other work – not a top priority,” Johnston said. “They don’t have the bandwidth to do that.”

On Friday the Vancouver Police Department stated police may now accompany city staff during COVID-19-related health and safety checks.

""We’re working to ensure all police officers are trained in their new legal authorities,” says Constable Tania Visintin, Media Relations Officer, VPD. “We’re asking the public for their patience and for people to voluntarily adhere to the new orders.”

VPD told Glacier Media the popular Granville Street club strip will remain closed on Friday and Saturday nights so long as clubs and restaurants remain open. ""Bars and restaurants remain open, so shutting down the street does reduce conflicts or injury to those patrons,"" said Visintin.

Apparent outdoor gatherings on the strip have been subject to criticism by social media accounts.

Spokeswoman Marie-Claude Lacasse said in an emailed statement the Health Department cannot release any information about the identity of the person who died, or any details about the death.

The province said 3,279 people between the ages of 10 and 19 have tested positive for COVID-19 to date. Among those cases, 31 people needed to be hospitalized, including six who were in intensive care.

Federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu offered her condolences to the family of the 19-year-old Friday, as did Quebec Premier Francois Legault.

""It's hard to find words for how much suffering that family must be going through right now,"" Hajdu told a news conference in Ottawa.

""It's troubling, it's worrying,"" Legault told reporters northeast of Montreal, regarding the young man's death.

""(COVID-19) attacks vulnerable people more, people who are older, but young people are not immune,"" the premier said, stressing the need to wear a mask to prevent the potential spread of the deadly virus.

Dr. Brian Ward, a professor of infectious diseases at the McGill University Health Centre, said while COVID-19 poses a greater risk to older people and individuals with medical problems, young people can still become seriously ill from the disease.

""It's not the first death in the world of somebody under the age of 20,"" Ward said in an interview Friday. ""And so, as long as Canada continues to accumulate cases, we can expect more deaths across the age range.""

Dr. Earl Rubin, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at the Montreal Children's Hospital, said young people dying from COVID-19 is a ""very rare occurrence,"" and most youth who do test positive do not need to be hospitalized.

But, he said, the 19-year-old's death may serve as an important reminder for young people to follow public health guidelines.

""It is a wake-up call that (COVID-19) is still an illness that they have to be aware of and do whatever they can to mitigate the chance of acquiring it and then transmitting it to others,"" Rubin said in an interview Friday.

""It just reinforces that we are far from out of the woods and with a second wave potentially upon us, it's important to remember and to heed and learn from it, more than anything else.""

Meanwhile, Quebec reported 93 new COVID-19 cases Friday, for a total of 61,495. Public health officials also reported three more deaths attributed to COVID-19. They said one death occurred in the past 24 hours while two others occurred between Aug. 14-20.

Quebec has reported a total of 5,733 deaths linked to the novel coronavirus.

The number of hospitalizations dropped by 10 to a total of 136 on Friday. Of those, 23 people are in intensive care, two fewer than a day earlier. Authorities said they conducted 16,164 COVID-19 tests Wednesday, the last day for which testing data is available.

It took 88 days for B.C. to go from recording its first case of the virus on January 28 to 100 deaths on April 25. It then has taken 117 days for the province to get to the 200-death threshold.

Deputy provincial health officer Réka Gustafson said the two new deaths were seniors – by far the hardest hit demographic.

The five deaths so far in August followed:

• 24 in March;

• 87 in April;

• 53 in May;

• 10 in June; and

• 21 in July

B.C. recorded 80 new COVID-19 infections on August 20, bringing the total number of people who have been afflicted to 4,825.

The breakdown of COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,526 in Vancouver Coastal Health (up 38);

• 2,533 in Fraser Health (up 40);

• 159 in Island Health (up one);

• 411 in Interior Health (no change);

• 121 in Northern Health (up one); and

• 75 people who reside outside Canada (no change).

For the first time since July 30, the number of recoveries is outpacing the number of new infections. There were 96 people who have recovered from the disease in the past 24 hours, making the total number of recoveries from the virus at 3,845. That, plus the two deaths, mean that there are now 780 people actively battling COVID-19 in B.C. – down 18 from yesterday.

Of those suffering with the disease, the vast majority are in self-isolation. There are, however, 11 people in hospitals with four of those in intensive care units.

One health facility has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

The outbreak at Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond has been declared over, leaving eight active outbreaks at seniors' homes:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge.

One new community outbreak has been declared at a Loblaws distribution centre at 2755 190th Street in Surrey, where nine people have tested positive, Gustafson said. She added that everyone who was part of an outbreak on Haida Gwaii has recovered.

BRITISH COLUMBIA

British Columbia has laid out its plan for studies to resume in ""learning groups"" this fall. School districts are to post final back-to-school details online by Aug. 26.

Back to class: Schools were initially scheduled to welcome students back full time on Sept. 8, but the province announced it is pushing back the restart date by two days to Sept. 10.

Groups: Students will be sorted into learning groups to reduce the number of people they come in contact with. For elementary and middle school students, groups will be no larger than 60 people. Secondary school groups will be capped at 120.

Physical distancing: Students and staff don't need to maintain physical distancing within their learning group, but contact should be minimized. Outside the group, physical distancing is required. Students should be more spaced out in classrooms.

Masks: Students and staff will not be required to wear masks in schools, but the province says it's a ""personal choice that will always be respected."" It says provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry recommends non-medical masks be worn by adults and older students when they are unable to physically distance like in hallways and on buses.

New routines: The province is urging schools to stagger recess, lunch and class transition times and take students outside whenever possible.

Transportation: Middle and high school students are asked to wear masks on buses. Students should be assigned seats, and a transparent barrier may be used to separate the driver.

ALBERTA

The province is planning to fully reopen schools from kindergarten to Grade 12 this fall. Measures will be tightened if an outbreak occurs and class sizes could be reduced to 20.

Back to class: School will be back in session with extra safety measures, but the province says there are programs to support remote and alternative learning.

Groups: Schools should sort students into cohorts by class when possible to minimize contact with others.

Physical distancing: Physical distancing is recommended when possible. Rooms should be rearranged to increase space between desks.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for staff and many students in some school settings. Students in Grades 4 to 12 must wear masks in all common areas, such as hallways and on buses. Staff are required to wear masks whenever physical distancing cannot be maintained. Mask use will be optional for kids in kindergarten through Grade 3. The government says all students and staff will receive two reusable masks as part of the policy.

Transportation: Parents are asked to bring their children to school if they can. Students who take the bus will sit in the same seat every day.

New routines: Schools are advised to consider a ""no sharing policy,"" with each student bringing their own supplies. Class, lunch and recess schedules will be staggered.

SASKATCHEWAN

Saskatchewan first unveiled a set of back-to-school guidelines in June, but released more details and made some changes in August.

Back to class: Students will return to class on Sept. 8 after the province pushed the date back from as early as Sept. 1

Groups: Groups of students and staff members assigned to them should stick together throughout the day and try not to mingle with other groups. Schools should aim to minimize the number of different instructors who interact with students throughout the day.

Physical distancing: Officials say maintaining physical distance is ""less practical"" for younger children, and the focus should be on limiting physical contact. Officials suggest limiting hugs and hand holding and suggest using alternative greetings such as air high fives. Schools are also to have dedicated quarantine areas where symptomatic students can go before they are picked up by parents.

Masks: The province says it's up to school boards to decide whether to make masks mandatory for students and staff. The chief medical health officer advises Grade 4 to 12 students should wear them in busy areas such as hallways and on buses.

Transportation: Parents should take their kids to school when possible, and pickup and drop-offs should happen outside. Students using school transportation should be assigned seats, and a partition may be used to separate the driver.

New routines: Start times, recess, lunch and class transitions may be staggered to allow for more space for physical distancing. Schools should rearrange their classrooms to space out students. Students and staff are asked to bring hand sanitizer. In school public health visits for routine vaccinations will include COVID-19 testing, with parental consent.

MANITOBA

The Manitoba government says students are going back to the classroom on Sept. 8 with new guidelines.

Back to class: All students from kindergarten to Grade 8 are to have in-class instruction five days a week. High school students will also be in class full time, however, there may be some days of remote learning.

Groups: When physical distancing isn't possible, students will have to be organized into cohorts of no more than 75, and minimize contact with others. In these cases, there must be at least one metre between their desks.

Physical distancing: The province says students are required to maintain a two-metre distance to ""the greatest extent possible."" When it isn't possible, physical barriers may be an option. Spaces should be arranged to encourage separation.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for in Grades 4 to 12 in classrooms where physical distancing cannot be maintained.

Transportation: Masks will be required on buses for students in Grade 5 and up, as well as drivers. Parents are encouraged to transport their children to school if they can.

New routines: Lunch and recess are to be staggered to minimize congestion, and in many cases teachers will change classrooms instead of students.

ONTARIO

Ontario students will be back in class September, but their schedules and class sizes may vary depending on where they live.

Back to class: Elementary students and many high schoolers will be in school five days a week in standard class sizes. However, secondary students at two dozen boards that are higher risk will only attend class half the time, and will spend the rest of the week working on ""curriculum-linked independent work."" Parents will also have the option to keep their kids out of class, and boards must provide options for remote learning.

Groups: For high schoolers in high-risk districts, class sizes will be capped at 15. Meanwhile, elementary students won't be broken up into smaller groups, but will be grouped into cohorts and their exposure to different teachers will be limited.

Physical distancing: While Education Minister Stephen Lecce said the aim is to keep students one metre apart from each other, a guidance document says only that schools should promote ""as much distancing as possible"" rather than being strictly enforced.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 through 12, and will be strongly encouraged for younger kids when they're in indoor common areas. Staff will be expected to wear masks.

Transportation: Some school boards may have more than one student assigned to a seat. When physical distancing isn't possible, masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 to 12, and younger students will be encouraged but not required to do the same.

New routines: Students in some districts will have to pre-register for in-person schooling. Some schools may limit or even ban visitors, including parents. Breaks will be scheduled to allow students to wash their hands.

QUEBEC

All elementary and high school students in Quebec will be required to attend class in September unless they have a doctor's note indicating they're at high risk of COVID-19 complications or they live with someone at risk. Those students will be allowed to study remotely.

Back to class: Class attendance is mandatory for elementary and high school students. For Grades 10 and 11, schools have the option of alternating schedules where students attend one day out of every two — as long as schools cannot maintain stable classroom bubbles. Grade 10 and 11 students are encouraged to attend classes as much as possible.

Groups: Each classroom will be its own bubble and students will not be required to maintain a two-metre distance between classmates.

Physical distancing: Students will need to keep a two-metre distance from all school staff, as well as all other students outside their classroom bubble. There are no physical distancing requirements for children or teachers in pre-school.

Masks: All students in Grade 5 and up — as well as all school staff — must wear a mask inside all common areas of the school except the classroom. Masks can also be removed when students are eating.

Transportation: No more than 48 students will be allowed on a school bus, with no more than two students sitting on the same bench. Preschool and elementary school students are strongly encouraged to wear masks, while older students are required to wear them.

New routines: When schools return in the fall, teachers will move from classroom to classroom, but students will stay put.

Backup plans: In the event of an outbreak in one class, the entire classroom bubble will be sent home to continue studies remotely. Authorities are also putting together an emergency protocol in the event of a second wave to ensure instruction continues online if entire schools are again forced to close. Ideas include quickly distributing tablets or laptops to students needing them and establishing a digital platform to continue courses and maintain communication.

NEW BRUNSWICK

The province has outlined a set of requirements schools must follow in developing their plans for the fall.

Back to class: Students in kindergarten to Grade 8 are to attend school full time, while those in Grades 9 to 12 are to be taught using a combination of in-class and remote instruction. At-home course work can include online learning, guided projects and experiential education.

Groups: For kindergarten through Grade 2, group sizes will be reduced to about 15, wherever possible. Group sizes should also be shrunk for Grades 3 to 5. Grades 6 to 8 will resume at regular class sizes. Students in Grades 9 to 12 will not be grouped because of their schedules and course options.

Physical distance: Grade 9 to 12 classrooms are required to maintain a one-metre distance, while a two-metre distance is recommended in common areas at all grade levels.

Masks: All students will be required to bring a mask to school, but masks will not be mandatory inside the classroom. Students in Grade 6-12 must wear masks on the school bus and in common areas of school buildings, while children in kindergarten to Grade 5 are encouraged to do so. Teachers for kindergarten to Grade 8 can choose whether they want to wear a mask or shield in the classroom while teachers for Grades 9-12 will be required to wear one when they cannot physically distance from students.

Transportation: Curtains will be installed inside school buses to separate drivers from students. If physical distancing is not possible, drivers will be required to wear a mask or face shield. Students must sit in the same seat every day. Students in kindergarten to Grade 5 will sit alone or with a member of their household. Students in Grades 6-12 wearing masks will sit two to a seat, and if they are sitting alone or with a member of their household, they do not have to wear a mask.

New routines: Arrivals, breaks and lunches are to be staggered. Public access to school buildings will be limited, and students, staff and visitors may also be subject to screening. High school students will be expected to have their own laptop or similar device, and some subsidies will be available. Drinking fountains will be replaced with water bottle-filling stations.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND

Schools on the Island are preparing to welcome all students back to class, while drafting backup plans for remote studies if required.

Back to class: Schools are to reopen for teachers and staff on Sept. 1 and for students on Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be organized into cohorts when possible and limit their exposure to others.

Physical distancing: Students will be taught about the importance of physical distancing, and extra teaching and cleaning staff may be hired. Schools are also asked to reduce class sizes as much as possible, reconfigure classrooms and make use of spaces such as libraries and multipurpose rooms.

Masks: The province says all staff and students in Grades 7-12 are ""strongly recommended"" to wear masks when physical distancing cannot be maintained. Students from kindergarten through Grade 6 may wear masks when physical distancing is impossible. Staff interacting with children who have complex medical needs are strongly recommended to wear face shields and gloves.

Transportation: Parents are asked to take their kids to school whenever possible. To reduce the number of riders on buses, schools may add vehicles and routes or implement walk-to-school programs. It is strongly recommended that all students and drivers wear masks on the bus.

New routines: P.E.I. education authorities are revising curricula for this school year to make up for learning gaps caused by lockdown constraints. Schools will stagger schedules to minimize congestion. The provincial school food program will be expanded next year in keeping with public health precautions. Elementary school students will stay in their classrooms for lunch.

NOVA SCOTIA

Education Minister Zach Churchill says the province's objective is for schools to return to 100 per cent capacity in the fall, but its plan includes measures to address the possible onset of a second wave of COVID-19.

Back to class: The province aims to have all elementary and high school students in classrooms by Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be asked to keep to cohorts.

Physical distancing: Students and staff will be encouraged to maintain a two-metre distance whenever possible. Lecture rooms will be reorganized to increase space between desks.

Masks: All students in grades 4 to 12 will be required to wear a mask inside schools except when seated at desks that are two metres apart and facing the same direction. Masks must be worn in hallways and other common areas if a two-metre distance cannot be maintained. All students and staff will receive two free cloth masks. Disposable masks will be available if a student loses theirs or comes to school without one.

Transportation: Students who take the school bus will be required to wear non-medical masks.

New routines: Only students and staff will be permitted to enter school buildings. When possible, teachers will be asked to move their classes outdoors. Students will be asked to bring their own computers to school, and the province says it has acquired an additional 14,000 devices for those with limited access to technology. The ventilation systems of each school will be assessed to ensure the equipment is operating properly.

University and college students entering Nova Scotia from outside Atlantic Canada will be required to undergo testing for COVID-19 in addition to self-isolating for 14 days. The province announced Aug. 20 post-secondary students will be tested three times over the course of their isolation period.

Backup plans: If a COVID-19 outbreak occurs during the academic year, schools will move to a blended learning model with smaller class sizes and home learning for older students.

---

NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR

The province's back-to-school plan aims to maximize in-class attendance with the option of a return to remote learning if the COVID-19 risk increases.

Back to class: The province's plan outlines three scenarios — in-class instruction, remote learning or a combination of both, depending on the COVID-19 risk in a particular community.

Groups: Cohorting by class is recommended when it's feasible, but students' schedules shouldn't be disrupted to support smaller groupings.

Physical distancing: Schools should aim to create a two-metre distance between desks, or as much distance as possible. However, provincial authorities say these precautions should not interfere with the daily school routine, and strict physical distancing should not be ""over-emphasized"" to children, because it is not practical and can cause psychological harm.

Masks: The province does not recommend masks for children, but says their use should not be ""stigmatized"" for those that choose to wear them. Staff will not be required to wear masks if physical distancing is possible.

Transportation: It will be up to school districts to determine their transportation operations, considering precautions such as assigning seats and separating the driver with a physical divider.

New routines: All students must bring their own supplies in keeping with a ""no sharing"" policy.

Backup plans: In the event of moderate-to-widespread transmission of COVID-19, school districts will move to online learning. Classroom attendance should be limited to about 50 per cent when the COVID-19 risk in a community is considered low to moderate. Newfoundland and Labrador says it will spend $20 million to purchase laptops for teachers and students in Grades 7 through 12 to support remote learning.

YUKON

The territorial government says it's making plans for the next school year that include flexibility around the number of students in classes if there's a second wave of COVID-19 or increased risk of transmission. It says each school will determine how it will adjust its operations to meet those guidelines, and school principals and staff are expected to share that information prior to September.

Back to class: Preliminary plans indicate that in rural communities, all students will return to school full time. In Whitehorse, however, kids in kindergarten through Grade 9 will return to full-day in-school instruction, while Grades 10 to 12 will spend half their day in the classroom, and the rest learning remotely.

Groups: Class sizes may be smaller to meet safety restrictions.

Masks: Wearing masks is a personal choice.

Transportation: Bus school and schedules will be posted to the territory's website.

New routines: Schedule shakeups may mean that some students won't have their regular teacher or the same classmates. School meal programs may be adapted with new safety measures and pickup options.

Backup plans: The territory has outlined a spectrum of school options if the risk to the community increases, ranging from rotating schedules to suspension of face-to-face learning.

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES

All N.W.T. schools have submitted plans to reopen their doors this fall. The territory says education authorities are taking a flexible approach in their planning to account for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall.

Back to class: While plans will vary from school to school, the territory will offer in-person instruction whenever possible, while ensuring alternative options are available.

Groups: Students in kindergarten through Grade 6 will be in classroom ""bubbles,"" and won't have to practise physical distancing within these groups.

Physical distancing: For Grades 7 to 9, students are asked to maintain a one-metre distance from each other, and two-metre distance from staff. Grade 10 to 12 students are asked to allow for two metres of distance from their peers and instructors.

Masks: Students of all ages may be required to wear masks in situations where physical distance cannot be practised, such as moving through the hallways.

Transportation: There may be changes to bus schedules, and all riders will be required to wear masks.

New routines: More time will be spent learning outside. School hours and schedules may also look different. Students are asked to label personal items and not share.

Backup plans: The territory says schools are preparing to shift between in-person, distance and blended learning at short notice should there become active COVID-19 cases.

---

NUNAVUT

The territory has released a four-stage plan for reopening schools based on the risk of the novel coronavirus in a community.

Back to class: There are no reported COVID-19 cases in Nunavut, so all schools are set to reopen this fall with enhanced cleaning and safety precautions.

Groups: It is recommended that schools cohort students by class and limit mixing as much as possible.

Physical distancing: Distance requirements will depend on what stage a community is in, and will primarily be achieved by limiting school attendance.

Masks: In most cases, the use of masks is not recommended for children. If there are exceptions, parents will be notified, and masks will be provided.

Transportation: As it stands, bus schedules are set to resume. Students older than 13 may be required to wear masks.

New routines: Group activities will be limited. Students won't be allowed to share food in lunchrooms.

Backup plans: The territory says schools could go part-time if contact tracing were to identify a possible source of COVID-19. All schools would be closed if community transmission were to take place.

A spokeswoman for the provincial Health Department, Marie-Claude Lacasse, said Thursday the province understands the importance of race-based COVID-19 data, but ""for the moment, we are not compiling the information.""

Thierry Lindor, a Montreal entrepreneur, launched an online platform this week to collect information from Black, Indigenous and other people of colour across Canada about how the novel coronavirus has affected them and their families.

article continues below

Eighty-nine people completed the anonymous online survey in the first 24 hours since The Colours of COVID was launched, Lindor said in an interview Thursday, adding that 80 to 90 per cent of respondents were in Quebec.

""How do you fight something you can't measure? It comes down to that,"" said Lindor, who has teamed up with a handful of advocacy groups, including the Federation of Black Canadians, on the project.

""The objective of The Colors of COVID is to make sure we're painting a clear picture of people that have been invisible for far too long.""

For months, community organizations across Canada have called for race-based data related to COVID-19 amid concerns Black, Indigenous and other communities of colour were being disproportionately affected by the virus.

The data, advocates argue, would help highlight underlying socioeconomic issues that they say often contribute to high infection rates and would pressure governments to take concrete action.

Yet, while Ontario has promised to collect race-based data linked to the pandemic, Quebec's public health director, Dr. Horacio Arruda, recently went back on a pledge he made in early May to do the same.

Arruda told reporters Aug. 3 that collecting data on race was ""sensitive"" and that Quebec instead would look at other ways to map specific communities' risk factors for infection, such as geography.

A spokeswoman for the provincial Health Department, Marie-Claude Lacasse, said Thursday the province understands the importance of race-based COVID-19 data, but ""for the moment, we are not compiling the information.""

She said in an email the public health agency is reviewing existing literature on how race may affect COVID-19 infection rates. It is also working with Montreal public health authorities, Lacasse said, on a study to evaluate whether ethnocultural background is a risk factor for COVID-19.

But that does not go far enough for many organizers, who say people of colour were abandoned when COVID-19 hit their communities — and that Quebec needs to go beyond merely studying the issue.

""To think that they would have the audacity, the gall, to try to do a study — to find out what? In six months from now, saying, 'Yeah, turns out that we should have collected race-based data,'"" said Lindor.

""That's just alarming to me. It's alarming, it's appalling, and it is not the Quebec I hope my kids grow up in.""

Tiffany Callender is the executive director of the Cote-des-Neiges Black Community Association, which advocates on behalf of Black families.

The Cote-des-Neiges neighbourhood was one of the areas most heavily affected by COVID-19 in Montreal, the epicenter of the pandemic in Quebec. Overall, the province has reported over 61,400 cases and 5,730 deaths linked to the virus to date.

Callender said many Cote-des-Neiges residents lost their jobs during the pandemic, while others were front-line workers who risked their health and the health of their family members, but had to continue working.

""At one point Cote-des-Neiges had the highest number of cases in Montreal and the response from the Quebec government was so delayed … It was really like being abandoned,"" she said in an interview.

Getting data to illustrate the problem will outline the community's needs and help groups pressure the government to allocate more resources, Callender said.

The survey asks participants to provide their ethnicity, age, gender, and what neighbourhood they live in, among other personal details.

It then asks participants if they have been tested for COVID-19, if they have family members or loved ones who tested positive or died from the virus, and asks how the pandemic has impacted their lives.

Callender added that the link between race and poverty, and the risks of contracting COVID-19, is clear.

""If you are going to be overly impacted by COVID-19, the likelihood that you live in poverty is great,"" she said. ""So then the question is, who lives in poverty? And when you answer that question, you will find people of colour.""

""I highly doubt that the government does not know that; it's that they would then have to act if they admit it.""

Lindor said he is in talks with the federal government to try to secure funding and other forms of support for The Colors of COVID. He said he hopes to collect 1,500 to 2,000 completed surveys over the next 60 days.

While most of the respondents answered the questions online, he said community groups and volunteers will use tablets to share the survey with vulnerable community members in person over the next several weeks.

For example, Lindor said, ""while they are collecting their food baskets at least once a week — they will be able to have a voice.""

What is happening to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and Employment Insurance?

The government is extending the CERB by an additional four weeks, thus offering a maximum 28 weeks of benefits. After that maximum is reached the government will launch a ""simplified"" EI program and three new kinds of benefits on Sept. 27.

Those on CERB will be able to transition to EI if they qualify under new parameters.

How many hours do you have to work to qualify for the new EI?

Canadians will now qualify for EI after working as few as 120 insurable hours, the equivalent of about 3.5 weeks, in the last 52 weeks.

EI claimants will receive a one-time credit of about 300 insurable hours for claims, if they have lost their job, or 480 insurable hours, if they have taken leave for a sickness, pregnancy or parental, compassionate care or family caregiver reasons.

Those credits will be available for one year and retroactive to March 15 for claimants who wanted to switch from CERB to EI maternity, parental, compassionate care, family caregiver or work-sharing benefits, but were stopped because they did not meet the hourly requirements.

How much money will people receive?

New EI claimants will receive at least $400 per week or $240 per week for extended parental benefits, if this is higher than their benefits would otherwise be.

Previous EI claimants were given 55 per cent of their average weekly earnings, up to a maximum $573 per week in 2020.

What is happening to the EI premium rate?

The EI premium rate is being frozen for two years at $1.58 per $100 in insurable earnings for employees and $2.21 per $100 in insurable earnings for employers.

What if I'm self-employed or don't qualify for EI?

The first of the three new benefits is the Canada Recovery Benefit for workers who are self-employed or not EI-eligible and still require income support because their work has not yet returned due to COVID-19.

This benefit will provide $400 per week for up to 26 weeks, while claimants continue to look for work.

They will be able to earn income from employment or self-employment while receiving the benefit, but need to repay 50 cents of every dollar earned above an annual net income of $38,000 through their income tax return.

The benefit will be available Sept. 27 and paid in arrears.

What if I get sick or have to isolate for COVID-19?

The government will offer the new and temporary Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit to provide income support for workers that are sick or must self-isolate because of COVID-19.

The benefit will offer $500 per week for up to two weeks and cannot be received while claimants are also taking paid sick leave.

It is also available Sept. 27 and paid in arrears.

What if I have to look after kids or family member?

The government has announced the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, a new and temporary program for workers who must miss work to care for a child under the age of 12, a family member or dependant because schools, daycares or day program facilities are closed due to COVID-19.

This benefit offers $500 per week for up to 26 weeks per household. It may be shared, but only one member of a household at any time can receive the benefit at a time.

Workers who prefer to keep dependents at home when facilities are open are not entitled to the benefit, which is effective Sept. 27 and paid in arrears too.

The details released Thursday outline what will happen to some four million workers receiving the $500-a-week Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which is set to wind down starting next month.

The details released Thursday outline what will happen to some four million workers receiving the $500-a-week Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which is set to wind down starting next month.

The CERB will be extended another four weeks, and a new benefit that pays $400 a week for up to 26 weeks will replace it for those ineligible for employment insurance.

Anyone eligible for EI will get the same minimum for at least 26 weeks and will need to have worked 120 hours to qualify, well below current EI requirements, since many Canadians have been unable to work to the pandemic.

There will also be $500-a-week sickness benefit and caregiving benefit for anyone who has to stay home because they're ill, or because school or daycare is closed.

Changes are also coming in to allow workers to keep more of their benefits even while they're working, eliminating the earnings cliff created under CERB that acted as a disincentive to work.

The three new benefits are expected to cost $22 billion and will be brought in through legislation once the House of Commons returns after being prorogued this week.

The CERB extension is expected to cost a further $8 billion, and $7 billion more to the EI system, and can be done through powers that Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough already has to create temporary EI measures.

EI premiums for employers and workers will be frozen for the next two years.

Government officials estimate about one million people will need the new workers' benefit that replaces the CERB, and three million will go onto the simplified EI program.

One federal official said these numbers remained high compared to what is normally seen with the EI program. Officials spoke at a media briefing Thursday that was provided on the condition they not be identified.

The official said the number of claims is more typical to what would be seen in an entire year, or even over two years.

The government estimate 400,000 people will receive benefits who otherwise wouldn't have qualified for EI when the CERB ends.

Since mid-March, the CERB has paid almost $69.4 billion in benefits to 8.61 million people, of which 4.1 million have since returned to the labour market.

Senator Yuen Pau Woo, who is a British Columbia representative in Parliament's upper house, said Thursday that he thinks COVID-19 has opened the door to rethink Canada's social safety net and its employment insurance system.

He spoke at a University of Victoria webinar that took place just before the Trudeau government released details about how it plans to wind down CERB, which provides $500 a week to qualified recipients whose income was affected by the pandemic.

While the senator did not go into detail on the new EI scheme, he said that a basic income program could be a solution to income inequality stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and economic downturn.

""What appears clear to me is that EI will be somewhat less of an insurance scheme after these changes and will have to incorporate elements of a social security scheme, which will complicate our EI system even more. And I can tell you, it is already a very complicated system,"" Woo said.

""How we fund it, is of course, a big question,"" Woo said.

He said the non-partisan Parliamentary Budget Office has provided an estimate of offsets that could be applied to reduce the gross cost of basic income.

""Depending on how politicians choose to apply those offsets, the net cost of basic income would be much less than the headline number.""

Woo said the current economic slowdown was caused by a health crisis, not a financial crisis, as in the 2008 downturn.

Since the financial sector is in ""relatively good shape,"" Woo said, the government should advocate for structural changes in how the financial system works, such as changes in how sovereign debt is handled across the world, and changing the incentives for companies to act on climate change initiatives.

For example, Woo said, the government can require private companies to disclose climate change-related risks to their business models. Woo also referenced the ""green new deal"" policies being proposed in other countries.

Paul Beaudry, a deputy governor of the Bank of Canada who also spoke on the panel, said the central bank has been working with the financial sector to forecast different potential scenarios surrounding climate change and the transition to a green economy.

""The future is very uncertain right now, there are lots of different paths … Are they going to be resilient? Are they investing in the right places? Do they recognize the risks involved?"" Beaudry said.

""We don’t have a direct mandate to do environmental policy, that’s not our role and we leave that to the elected officials. But we do have a responsibility to make sure the financial system is doing what needs to be done.""

Up until now, travellers had to carry a mask but were not required to wear it on board unless they were in an area where distancing wasn’t possible.

“When people are travelling on the BC Ferries system, on a terminal or a ship, they must wear a mask,” Collins said at the BC Ferries annual general meeting on Aug. 20.

“There are certain key exceptions. If you’re in your car or eating in a designated area [or] if you’re outside and you can be sure of maintaining distance, that’s OK. But if you’re in the interior of our ships or terminals it will no longer be discretionary; it will be mandatory.”

The new policy will go into force on Monday, Aug. 24, the same day similar mask requirements take effect on the BC Transit and TransLink systems.

BC Ferries said exemptions will also be made for travellers with an underlying medical condition or disability that inhibits the ability to wear a face covering, those who are unable to place or remove a face covering without assistance, and children under two years of age.

Those who do not follow the policy could be banned from travel.

Collins also told the AGM, which was held in front of limited crowd in Victoria and streamed online, that the company expects to be back to pre-COVID capacity levels across the system starting Sept. 7.

“That’s good progress when you consider the cliff that we’ve come through,” he said. “We would have liked it to have been faster, but it’s reasonable and prudent… We’re grateful to be at this stage.”

Responding to a question about another COVID safety measure, Collins said it’s “100 per cent certain” that Transport Canada will end the temporary exemption allowing people to remain in their vehicles on closed decks.

“That regulation will come back into force at some point, likely this fall,” he said. “We are discussing with Transport Canada that later is better as we need to wait to see [about a] potential second wave, if it emerges or if the situation stabilizes… We’re advocating strongly that the date be as late as possible.”

Just prior to the AGM, BC Ferries released its first quarter results coving the period April 1 to June 30.

Ferries said revenue for the quarter was $137.4 million, down $109 million year-over-year, a loss that was partially offset by reductions in expenses of $36.7 million compared to the first quarter of last year.

Among those lower expenses was the cost of salaries, wages and benefits, which dropped from $101.3 million for the first quarter of 2019 to $89.7 million. The ferry company also spent $8.6 million less on fuel in the first quarter of this fiscal year than it did over the same period last year.

The $62-million net loss compares to net earnings of $12.2 million for the first quarter of 2019.

BC Ferries did not release details for individual routes, but said on the four major routes, which include Langdale-Horseshoe Bay, there were 44 per cent fewer sailings and the ships carried 53 per cent less vehicle traffic and 68 per cent less passenger traffic.

In the management discussion and analysis document filed as part of the quarterly report, the company said it averaged $77.49 per vehicle on the major routes, 18 per cent more than it had in the first quarter of last year, “mainly as a result of a change in the traffic mix (increased commercial traffic with higher tariffs) and a higher proportion of vehicles travelling with a reservation.”

The result was a decrease of $71.8 million in revenue from fares on majors and a drop of $83.7 million across all routes, as well as decreases in revenue from parking, catering and on-board services.

The company also noted in the management discussion and analysis that as of Aug. 11, BC Ferries was included in the federal-provincial safe start agreement, which sets aside $1.08 billion for transit.

“Over the past few months, BC Ferries has been working closely with the province, having formed a task force to collaboratively work together on strategic options to sustain the ferry system for the long term,” the company said.

While BC Ferries continues to report losses, the BC Ferry and Marine Workers Union (BCFMWU) launched a “More Sailings, More Service” campaign Aug. 17, urging British Columbians to write their MLAs and MPs to demand governments “step up to fix this long term” with increased funding.

BCFMWU member Karli Davies, the campaign spokesperson for the Sunshine Coast, said more funding is key to the future of the Langdale-Horseshoe Bay route.

“We're not a self-sufficient community. You have to travel for medical appointments for specialists, we have commuters that travel, including essential workers. We also have youth that have to travel for sports teams and post secondary education,” Davies told Coast Reporter. “Our union feels that this is definitely a key area that is suffering from the lack of service right now.”

Davies said the union welcomed the announcement of funding through the federal-provincial safe start agreement, but the “More Sailings, More Service” campaign is looking at the long term.

“We think right now is the best time to invest,” Davies said. “The Sunshine Coast won’t survive if we don't improve the service level… The needs weren’t even being met pre pandemic.”

Davies said the union is hoping the campaign, which she said has had a good response so far, gains traction outside ferry-dependent communities as well. “We want to raise awareness not just of our coastal residents, but also the people who live in Vancouver and inland as well, because everyone benefits from the service levels being improved.”"

The shortfall jeopardizes the ability of the country to find employees needed in sectors such as health and elder care as the baby boom generation moves into retirement over the next few years, the report says.

It calls on the federal government to find new ways to encourage more immigrants to move to Canada.

""Canada does rely on having large numbers of people coming to the country to fuel growth and, if we see these large declines, one concern could be that people may decide maybe they don't want to come to Canada anymore,"" said report author Andrew Agopsowicz, a senior economist for RBC who studies labour trends.

""I think it's really important for Canada to ensure the process is clear and that we still put out this attitude that we are open and we want people from the rest of the world to come to our country.""

Canada added 34,000 permanent residents in the second quarter, down 67 per cent from the same period last year, the RBC study said.

Meanwhile, new permanent residency applications to Canada were down 80 per cent and just over 10,000 new study permits were processed, down from 107,000 a year earlier.

Despite a recent recovery in the pace of immigration, the bank expects to see only 70 per cent of the originally targeted 341,000 new permanent residents at the end of the year, a decline of about 100,000 people.

The shortfall is particularly bad news for elder care as labour shortages have gotten worse in the wake of the pandemic's deadly sweep through the country's nursing homes, said Dr. Samir Sinha, director of health policy research at the National Institute on Ageing at Ryerson University and director of geriatrics at Mount Sinai Hospital.

""We've been having a huge struggle finding workers and retaining workers in this sector for years ... and we were only keeping it afloat by often recruiting immigrants who are willing to take on these jobs that we as Canadians didn't want to do,"" he said.

""The fact it's low paid and not valued also speaks to one of the reasons it's been incredibly hard retaining (staff).""

Sinha said higher wages are needed not only to recruit Canadian-born workers but also to keep ambitious immigrants on the job longer.

Canada's ability to attract immigrants with meaningful work as the economy struggles to rebound from the pandemic may be difficult.

A Statistics Canada report published Thursday finds that recent immigrants were harder hit by pandemic-related job losses, with 17 per cent becoming unemployed from March to April compared with 13.5 per cent of workers who are Canadian-born or immigrants who have been in Canada more than 10 years.

The percentage was higher, almost 20 per cent, for recent female immigrants.

The difference is significant, said Statistics Canada analyst Feng Hou, adding it is attributed mostly to recent immigrants having less work experience and earning lower wages.

""From past experience, when immigrants come during hard times, they tend to have a hard time finding jobs,"" he said, adding there's no data as yet to tell if that will happen in the current environment.

Travel restrictions that began in March and continue today make it difficult for people to physically come to Canada, Agopsowicz said.

At the same time, the lockdowns in the early days of the pandemic slowed processing of applications in Canada and prevented potential immigrants from accessing programs to ease application in their home countries.

An unknown is whether the COVID-19 virus, which hits senior citizens hardest, will have a dampening affect on the desire of foreigners to come to Canada and leave behind their vulnerable elderly relatives, Agopsowicz said.

""There's a lot of uncertainty, I think, when people arrive already during normal times, so I think people are starting to work through what that means,"" he said.

""This may be somewhat of a lost year (but) is this going to be easy to recover from next year in terms of bringing increased numbers back?""

Only about 20 per cent of new permanent residents are former students or temporary workers, he pointed out, suggesting Ottawa could do more to try to convince those people to permanently reside in Canada to bolster numbers.

The rise comes as the new infections outpace recoveries. The province today recorded 68 new cases, bringing the total number of people infected to 4,745 since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province. Only 45 people recovered from the virus in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of recoveries to 3,749, according to data from Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Réka Gustafson.

The breakdown of COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,488 in Vancouver Coastal Health (up 41);

• 2,493 in Fraser Health (up 20);

• 158 in Island Health (up two);

• 411 in Interior Health (up four);

• 120 in Northern Health (no change); and

• 75 people who reside outside Canada (up one).

The good news is that there were no new deaths recorded, leaving the death toll from the virus at 198. Hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province has 10 people in hospital with COVID-19 (up four from yesterday) while four people are in intensive care units, which is up one from yesterday. The vast majority of those infected are self-isolating at home.

One health facility has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

The outbreak at Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond has been declared over, leaving eight active outbreaks at seniors' homes:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge.

Gustafson and Dix said in a joint statment that the province is stepping up testing for the virus that has spawned a global pandemic.

""We know as the number of new cases increases, demand for testing also goes up,"" they said.

""That is why each health region has been working to add further assessment and testing capacity. New assessment and testing centres and extended hours of service have been added in the Vancouver Coastal Health and Fraser Health regions to address increases in demand. Today, we have the ability to complete approximately 8,000 tests every day.""

Testing is key because it allows government researchers to trace and contain the spread of the disease, they said, adding that provincial capacity is now up to around 8,000 tests per day.

""The tests tell us who is positive for the virus, as well as how far the virus may have spread among close contacts when an outbreak or community cluster occurs,"" they said.

Anyone with symptoms is eligible to be tested and healh officials say getting tested is only recommended if people are showing symptoms. Typical symptoms include a dry cough, fever and difficulty discerning flavours in food.

Those who think they have these symptoms are asked to keep their distance from others, and to phone 8-1-1, or their health-care provider to arrange for an assessment.

Brittany Bingham recently became the first Indigenous PhD graduate from Simon Fraser University’s faculty of health sciences, and her earlier research and PhD involved community-based projects and the incorporation of methods that draw on Indigenous culture.

The Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research, which is funding the project, describes it as “a community-driven approach to examine patient data … along with the advice of key urban Indigenous community organizations and stakeholders,” with the end goal of coming up with recommendations “by and for the urban Indigenous community.”

Bingham told Coast Reporter the research team she’ll be leading will work closely with community organizations and First Nations in the Vancouver area to try to identify gaps or potential areas of risk for the Indigenous population and “very quickly gather information that can inform recommendations for what we need to do going forward this fall, winter and for this coming year.”

“There are approaches to research where the researchers just examine the data, and then put out the information,” she said. “We're going to get advice from the community experts on what data is important, what should we be looking at and what they need to inform their work with the community.”

Bingham said with the pandemic still ongoing, how researchers work with those community groups will be different than it would have been in the past.

“The main challenge is the approach to engaging with communities,” she said. “Typically we’re meeting with people in person and having that face-to-face approach. Now we have to be do things more virtually and transitioning to that virtual research environment is a bit of a challenge, but it’s been going well so far.”

Bingham said that although the project will focus on Vancouver’s urban Indigenous population she expects much of what they learn will be applicable to rural areas that include First Nations, like the Sunshine Coast, and more remote Indigenous communities.

“I think that the key is that we need to incorporate Indigenous community expertise into the research and into the recommendations that we're making and there may be unique context to Indigenous communities that needs to be taken into consideration in a COVID response.”

While completing her PhD, Bingham also worked with Fraser Health and Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) researching cultural safety and primary care, and with the Centre for Gender and Sexual Health Equity. She’ll be continuing that work as the newly-appointed director of Indigenous Research at VCH Aboriginal Health and the Centre.

In a release announcing her appointment, Bingham said, “This joint role will enable our research teams to collaborate on community-driven research that is directly responsive to international and national calls to action and justice for Indigenous peoples health and develop recommendations for achieving health equity for Indigenous peoples, with a particular focus on Indigenous women’s wellness.”

Bingham told Coast Reporter that as well as the support of her family as she worked to complete her PhD and continue her other work and research, she’s had a lot of support from the shíshálh Nation.

“I'm a really proud member of the shíshálh Nation and they’ve been very supportive of me in this academic journey,” she said. “I'm very thankful for that.”"

Some four million workers will move onto EI next month when a key COVID-19 benefit for workers, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, begins to wind down.

Millions more who have seen their incomes crash as a result of the pandemic-related shutdown won't qualify for the decades-old social safety net program, but the Liberals had promised a new EI-like support for those who will still need the help.

Sources who have been briefed on the government's plan say that transfer will be done through regulations, rather than legislation that could not be introduced until late September, following the prorogation of Parliament.

The measures are to be temporary and flow through existing programs and tools, the sources say, meaning the Liberals won't need parliamentary approval.

The sources, who spoke to The Canadian Press on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the plans publicly, say details will come soon.

The Liberals have agreed on how to extend EI-like benefits to those currently deemed ineligible for the program, as well as a floor on the value and duration of payments.

Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress, said he sees the temporary measures as a springboard to a larger overhaul of the federal safety net.

Its weaknesses have been known for years and widely exposed through the pandemic-induced crisis, he said.

""We need to look at these temporary measures and figure out how do we incorporate some of that as permanent measures into the future,"" Yussuff said, ""because you can't have a social safety net where a significant chunk of people don't even have any net.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made clear his intention to reshape a safety net that supports a modern workforce and ""gig"" economy. The Liberal cabinet is slated to talk about the larger overhaul at next month's retreat.

David Macdonald, a senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, noted recently that about 4.7 million people were receiving the CERB at the start of August, with about 2.1 million not eligible for EI under existing program rules.

He added that just over half of CERB recipients at risk of being ineligible for EI are women, and they would also receive less than under the CERB.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called on Trudeau to extend the CERB until the end of September and present a plan to fix EI by the end of this month.

""Millions of people across the country are stressed about how they're going to make ends meet when the Liberals cancel the CERB at the end of the month,"" Singh said in a statement issued Wednesday.

Unemployment is expected to remain high for the rest of 2020, with employment levels not reaching pre-pandemic levels until some time next year, based on Royal Bank forecasts released Wednesday.

It makes sense to help people in the short term, but the question for the government will be what to do if a large chunk of the labour force still needs help by late 2021, said Robert Asselin, a former adviser to Trudeau and now former finance minister Bill Morneau.

""If you create a program like EI and say, we're going to support these people as long as it takes ... you basically create a permanent income-support program and it's hugely expensive,"" said Asselin, now a senior vice-president at the Business Council of Canada.

""It's going to have to be paid for by someone, including employers. You're effectively putting a tax eventually on businesses, which I think would be very damaging in the current circumstances.""

Modelling done in the latest report on EI premiums showed rates would have to rise by five cents per year for four years in response to a recession like the one the country suffered during the 2008-2009 financial crisis.

The estimate didn't account for any special, temporary economic measures the government could put in place like a rate freeze, or benefit expansion.

BRITISH COLUMBIA

British Columbia has laid out its plan for studies to resume in ""learning groups"" this fall. School districts are to post final back-to-school details online by Aug. 26.

Back to class: Schools were initially scheduled to welcome students back full time on Sept. 8, but the province announced it is pushing back the restart date by two days to Sept. 10.

Groups: Students will be sorted into learning groups to reduce the number of people they come in contact with. For elementary and middle school students, groups will be no larger than 60 people. Secondary school groups will be capped at 120.

Physical distancing: Students and staff don't need to maintain physical distancing within their learning group, but contact should be minimized. Outside the group, physical distancing is required. Students should be more spaced out in classrooms.

Masks: Students and staff will not be required to wear masks in schools, but the province says it's a ""personal choice that will always be respected."" It says provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry recommends non-medical masks be worn by adults and older students when they are unable to physically distance like in hallways and on buses.

New routines: The province is urging schools to stagger recess, lunch and class transition times and take students outside whenever possible.

Transportation: Middle and high school students are asked to wear masks on buses. Students should be assigned seats, and a transparent barrier may be used to separate the driver.

ALBERTA

The province is planning to fully reopen schools from kindergarten to Grade 12 this fall. Measures will be tightened if an outbreak occurs and class sizes could be reduced to 20.

Back to class: School will be back in session with extra safety measures, but the province says there are programs to support remote and alternative learning.

Groups: Schools should sort students into cohorts by class when possible to minimize contact with others.

Physical distancing: Physical distancing is recommended when possible. Rooms should be rearranged to increase space between desks.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for staff and many students in some school settings. Students in Grades 4 to 12 must wear masks in all common areas, such as hallways and on buses. Staff are required to wear masks whenever physical distancing cannot be maintained. Mask use will be optional for kids in kindergarten through Grade 3. The government says all students and staff will receive two reusable masks as part of the policy.

Transportation: Parents are asked to bring their children to school if they can. Students who take the bus will sit in the same seat every day.

New routines: Schools are advised to consider a ""no sharing policy,"" with each student bringing their own supplies. Class, lunch and recess schedules will be staggered.

SASKATCHEWAN

Saskatchewan first unveiled a set of back-to-school guidelines in June, but released more details and made some changes in August.

Back to class: Students will return to class on Sept. 8 after the province pushed the date back from as early as Sept. 1

Groups: Groups of students and staff members assigned to them should stick together throughout the day and try not to mingle with other groups. Schools should aim to minimize the number of different instructors who interact with students throughout the day.

Physical distancing: Officials say maintaining physical distance is ""less practical"" for younger children, and the focus should be on limiting physical contact. Officials suggest limiting hugs and hand holding and suggest using alternative greetings such as air high fives. Schools are also to have dedicated quarantine areas where symptomatic students can go before they are picked up by parents.

Masks: The province says it's up to school boards to decide whether to make masks mandatory for students and staff. The chief medical health officer advises Grade 4 to 12 students should wear them in busy areas such as hallways and on buses.

Transportation: Parents should take their kids to school when possible, and pickup and drop-offs should happen outside. Students using school transportation should be assigned seats, and a partition may be used to separate the driver.

New routines: Start times, recess, lunch and class transitions may be staggered to allow for more space for physical distancing. Schools should rearrange their classrooms to space out students. Students and staff are asked to bring hand sanitizer. In school public health visits for routine vaccinations will include COVID-19 testing, with parental consent.

MANITOBA

The Manitoba government says students are going back to the classroom on Sept. 8 with new guidelines.

Back to class: All students from kindergarten to Grade 8 are to have in-class instruction five days a week. High school students will also be in class full time, however, there may be some days of remote learning.

Groups: When physical distancing isn't possible, students will have to be organized into cohorts of no more than 75, and minimize contact with others. In these cases, there must be at least one metre between their desks.

Physical distancing: The province says students are required to maintain a two-metre distance to ""the greatest extent possible."" When it isn't possible, physical barriers may be an option. Spaces should be arranged to encourage separation.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for in Grades 4 to 12 in classrooms where physical distancing cannot be maintained.

Transportation: Masks will be required on buses for students in Grade 5 and up, as well as drivers. Parents are encouraged to transport their children to school if they can.

New routines: Lunch and recess are to be staggered to minimize congestion, and in many cases teachers will change classrooms instead of students.

ONTARIO

Ontario students will be back in class September, but their schedules and class sizes may vary depending on where they live.

Back to class: Elementary students and many high schoolers will be in school five days a week in standard class sizes. However, secondary students at two dozen boards that are higher risk will only attend class half the time, and will spend the rest of the week working on ""curriculum-linked independent work."" Parents will also have the option to keep their kids out of class, and boards must provide options for remote learning.

Groups: For high schoolers in high-risk districts, class sizes will be capped at 15. Meanwhile, elementary students won't be broken up into smaller groups, but will be grouped into cohorts and their exposure to different teachers will be limited.

Physical distancing: While Education Minister Stephen Lecce said the aim is to keep students one metre apart from each other, a guidance document says only that schools should promote ""as much distancing as possible"" rather than being strictly enforced.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 through 12, and will be strongly encouraged for younger kids when they're in indoor common areas. Staff will be expected to wear masks.

Transportation: Some school boards may have more than one student assigned to a seat. When physical distancing isn't possible, masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 to 12, and younger students will be encouraged but not required to do the same.

New routines: Students in some districts will have to pre-register for in-person schooling. Some schools may limit or even ban visitors, including parents. Breaks will be scheduled to allow students to wash their hands.

QUEBEC

All elementary and high school students in Quebec will be required to attend class in September unless they have a doctor's note indicating they're at high risk of COVID-19 complications or they live with someone at risk. Those students will be allowed to study remotely.

Back to class: Class attendance is mandatory for elementary and high school students. For Grades 10 and 11, schools have the option of alternating schedules where students attend one day out of every two — as long as schools cannot maintain stable classroom bubbles. Grade 10 and 11 students are encouraged to attend classes as much as possible.

Groups: Each classroom will be its own bubble and students will not be required to maintain a two-metre distance between classmates.

Physical distancing: Students will need to keep a two-metre distance from all school staff, as well as all other students outside their classroom bubble. There are no physical distancing requirements for children or teachers in pre-school.

Masks: All students in Grade 5 and up — as well as all school staff — must wear a mask inside all common areas of the school except the classroom. Masks can also be removed when students are eating.

Transportation: No more than 48 students will be allowed on a school bus, with no more than two students sitting on the same bench. Preschool and elementary school students are strongly encouraged to wear masks, while older students are required to wear them.

New routines: When schools return in the fall, teachers will move from classroom to classroom, but students will stay put.

Backup plans: In the event of an outbreak in one class, the entire classroom bubble will be sent home to continue studies remotely. Authorities are also putting together an emergency protocol in the event of a second wave to ensure instruction continues online if entire schools are again forced to close. Ideas include quickly distributing tablets or laptops to students needing them and establishing a digital platform to continue courses and maintain communication.

NEW BRUNSWICK

The province has outlined a set of requirements schools must follow in developing their plans for the fall.

Back to class: Students in kindergarten to Grade 8 are to attend school full time, while those in Grades 9 to 12 are to be taught using a combination of in-class and remote instruction. At-home course work can include online learning, guided projects and experiential education.

Groups: For kindergarten through Grade 2, group sizes will be reduced to about 15, wherever possible. Group sizes should also be shrunk for Grades 3 to 5. Grades 6 to 8 will resume at regular class sizes. Students in Grades 9 to 12 will not be grouped because of their schedules and course options.

Physical distance: Grade 9 to 12 classrooms are required to maintain a one-metre distance, while a two-metre distance is recommended in common areas at all grade levels.

Masks: All students will be required to bring a mask to school, but masks will not be mandatory inside the classroom. Students in Grade 6-12 must wear masks on the school bus and in common areas of school buildings, while children in kindergarten to Grade 5 are encouraged to do so. Teachers for kindergarten to Grade 8 can choose whether they want to wear a mask or shield in the classroom while teachers for Grades 9-12 will be required to wear one when they cannot physically distance from students.

Transportation: Curtains will be installed inside school buses to separate drivers from students. If physical distancing is not possible, drivers will be required to wear a mask or face shield. Students must sit in the same seat every day. Students in kindergarten to Grade 5 will sit alone or with a member of their household. Students in Grades 6-12 wearing masks will sit two to a seat, and if they are sitting alone or with a member of their household, they do not have to wear a mask.

New routines: Arrivals, breaks and lunches are to be staggered. Public access to school buildings will be limited, and students, staff and visitors may also be subject to screening. High school students will be expected to have their own laptop or similar device, and some subsidies will be available. Drinking fountains will be replaced with water bottle-filling stations.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND

Schools on the Island are preparing to welcome all students back to class, while drafting backup plans for remote studies if required.

Back to class: Schools are to reopen for teachers and staff on Sept. 1 and for students on Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be organized into cohorts when possible and limit their exposure to others.

Physical distancing: Students will be taught about the importance of physical distancing, and extra teaching and cleaning staff may be hired. Schools are also asked to reduce class sizes as much as possible, reconfigure classrooms and make use of spaces such as libraries and multipurpose rooms.

Masks: The province says all staff and students in Grades 7-12 are ""strongly recommended"" to wear masks when physical distancing cannot be maintained. Students from kindergarten through Grade 6 may wear masks when physical distancing is impossible. Staff interacting with children who have complex medical needs are strongly recommended to wear face shields and gloves.

Transportation: Parents are asked to take their kids to school whenever possible. To reduce the number of riders on buses, schools may add vehicles and routes or implement walk-to-school programs. It is strongly recommended that all students and drivers wear masks on the bus.

New routines: P.E.I. education authorities are revising curricula for this school year to make up for learning gaps caused by lockdown constraints. Schools will stagger schedules to minimize congestion. The provincial school food program will be expanded next year in keeping with public health precautions. Elementary school students will stay in their classrooms for lunch.

NOVA SCOTIA

Education Minister Zach Churchill says the province's objective is for schools to return to 100 per cent capacity in the fall, but its plan includes measures to address the possible onset of a second wave of COVID-19.

Back to class: The province aims to have all elementary and high school students in classrooms by Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be asked to keep to cohorts.

Physical distancing: Students and staff will be encouraged to maintain a two-metre distance whenever possible. Lecture rooms will be reorganized to increase space between desks.

Masks: All students in grades 4 to 12 will be required to wear a mask inside schools except when seated at desks that are two metres apart and facing the same direction. Masks must be worn in hallways and other common areas if a two-metre distance cannot be maintained. All students and staff will receive two free cloth masks. Disposable masks will be available if a student loses theirs or comes to school without one.

Transportation: Students who take the school bus will be required to wear non-medical masks.

New routines: Only students and staff will be permitted to enter school buildings. When possible, teachers will be asked to move their classes outdoors. Students will be asked to bring their own computers to school, and the province says it has acquired an additional 14,000 devices for those with limited access to technology. The ventilation systems of each school will be assessed to ensure the equipment is operating properly.

Backup plans: If a COVID-19 outbreak occurs during the academic year, schools will move to a blended learning model with smaller class sizes and home learning for older students.

---

NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR

The province's back-to-school plan aims to maximize in-class attendance with the option of a return to remote learning if the COVID-19 risk increases.

Back to class: The province's plan outlines three scenarios — in-class instruction, remote learning or a combination of both, depending on the COVID-19 risk in a particular community.

Groups: Cohorting by class is recommended when it's feasible, but students' schedules shouldn't be disrupted to support smaller groupings.

Physical distancing: Schools should aim to create a two-metre distance between desks, or as much distance as possible. However, provincial authorities say these precautions should not interfere with the daily school routine, and strict physical distancing should not be ""over-emphasized"" to children, because it is not practical and can cause psychological harm.

Masks: The province does not recommend masks for children, but says their use should not be ""stigmatized"" for those that choose to wear them. Staff will not be required to wear masks if physical distancing is possible.

Transportation: It will be up to school districts to determine their transportation operations, considering precautions such as assigning seats and separating the driver with a physical divider.

New routines: All students must bring their own supplies in keeping with a ""no sharing"" policy.

Backup plans: In the event of moderate-to-widespread transmission of COVID-19, school districts will move to online learning. Classroom attendance should be limited to about 50 per cent when the COVID-19 risk in a community is considered low to moderate. Newfoundland and Labrador says it will spend $20 million to purchase laptops for teachers and students in Grades 7 through 12 to support remote learning.

YUKON

The territorial government says it's making plans for the next school year that include flexibility around the number of students in classes if there's a second wave of COVID-19 or increased risk of transmission. It says each school will determine how it will adjust its operations to meet those guidelines, and school principals and staff are expected to share that information prior to September.

Back to class: Preliminary plans indicate that in rural communities, all students will return to school full time. In Whitehorse, however, kids in kindergarten through Grade 9 will return to full-day in-school instruction, while Grades 10 to 12 will spend half their day in the classroom, and the rest learning remotely.

Groups: Class sizes may be smaller to meet safety restrictions.

Masks: Wearing masks is a personal choice.

Transportation: Bus school and schedules will be posted to the territory's website.

New routines: Schedule shakeups may mean that some students won't have their regular teacher or the same classmates. School meal programs may be adapted with new safety measures and pickup options.

Backup plans: The territory has outlined a spectrum of school options if the risk to the community increases, ranging from rotating schedules to suspension of face-to-face learning.

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES

All N.W.T. schools have submitted plans to reopen their doors this fall. The territory says education authorities are taking a flexible approach in their planning to account for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall.

Back to class: While plans will vary from school to school, the territory will offer in-person instruction whenever possible, while ensuring alternative options are available.

Groups: Students in kindergarten through Grade 6 will be in classroom ""bubbles,"" and won't have to practise physical distancing within these groups.

Physical distancing: For Grades 7 to 9, students are asked to maintain a one-metre distance from each other, and two-metre distance from staff. Grade 10 to 12 students are asked to allow for two metres of distance from their peers and instructors.

Masks: Students of all ages may be required to wear masks in situations where physical distance cannot be practised, such as moving through the hallways.

Transportation: There may be changes to bus schedules, and all riders will be required to wear masks.

New routines: More time will be spent learning outside. School hours and schedules may also look different. Students are asked to label personal items and not share.

Backup plans: The territory says schools are preparing to shift between in-person, distance and blended learning at short notice should there become active COVID-19 cases.

---

NUNAVUT

The territory has released a four-stage plan for reopening schools based on the risk of the novel coronavirus in a community.

Back to class: There are no reported COVID-19 cases in Nunavut, so all schools are set to reopen this fall with enhanced cleaning and safety precautions.

Groups: It is recommended that schools cohort students by class and limit mixing as much as possible.

Physical distancing: Distance requirements will depend on what stage a community is in, and will primarily be achieved by limiting school attendance.

Masks: In most cases, the use of masks is not recommended for children. If there are exceptions, parents will be notified, and masks will be provided.

Transportation: As it stands, bus schedules are set to resume. Students older than 13 may be required to wear masks.

New routines: Group activities will be limited. Students won't be allowed to share food in lunchrooms.

Backup plans: The territory says schools could go part-time if contact tracing were to identify a possible source of COVID-19. All schools would be closed if community transmission were to take place.

COVID-19 is spread by respiratory droplets when a person who is sick coughs or sneezes. It can also be spread when a healthy person touches an object or surface (e.g. a doorknob or a table) with the virus on it, and then touches their mouth, nose or eyes before washing their hands.

The B.C. Teachers Federation issued a statement Wednesday asking the provincial government to add more physical distancing measures to its back-to-school plan to reduce the transmission of COVID-19.

Federation president Teri Mooring said the union has been working with the province but some of its biggest concerns have not been addressed.

""When we go into the grocery store or we go into the drug store we're expected to wear masks, and often times the number of people in the space is also restricted,"" she said in an interview. ""So we're looking for the same health and safety measures that we know work, that we know limit transmission of the virus, to be required in classrooms as well.""

The federation issued seven recommendations including a reduction in class density, retrofitting classrooms with physical barriers and funding to replace outdated ventilation systems.

It also wants when masks must be worn expanded for staff and students who are 10 and older beyond common areas like hallways to anywhere that physical distancing is not possible, including classrooms, libraries and labs.

Education Minister Rob Fleming said a number of issues raised by the union have been addressed through working groups. The government's restart plan enables districts to provide schooling within guidelines set by the B.C. Centre for Disease Control.

""The health and safety of teachers, students and staff is our top priority,"" Fleming said in a statement

Class sizes average between 18 students for kindergarten and 22.4 students for grades 8 to 12, the government said.

And the government has committed $45.6 million for enhanced cleaning, hand washing stations, reusable masks and other supplies, he said.

Many provinces are requiring masks for Grades 4 through 12 but where they will be required varies.

In Manitoba, it's wherever two metres of physical distance cannot be maintained, while in Alberta it's in common areas like hallways and buses and in Ontario it's anywhere indoors including classrooms.

Class attendance is required for elementary and high school students in Quebec for anyone who doesn't have a doctor's note indicating they're at high risk to COVID-19 complications or live with someone who is.

Alberta is planning a full return to school but the government says measures will be tightened if an outbreak occurs and class sizes could be reduced to 20.

B.C. school districts must post final back-to-school details online by Aug. 26 but the ministry has provided some guidance on what is expected.

Learning groups are being established on the advice of the provincial health officer to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19 and could be made up of a single class of students or multiple classes.

For elementary and middle school students, groups will be no larger than 60 people. Secondary school groups will be capped at 120.

However, Mooring said the restart plan for kindergarten to Grade 12 has made no change to classroom density and it's impossible to physical distance with 30 people in a classroom, even using learning groups.

The union is particularly worried about the situation in B.C.'s largest and fastest growing districts that use hundreds of portables.

""Many B.C. schools also have outdated ventilation systems and thousands of students will be in classrooms without external windows,"" Mooring said.

The union is also calling for a remote learning option, especially for children with medical problems or those with vulnerable family members, and accommodations for immunocompromised teachers.

On Monday, the ministry announced staff and students at middle and secondary schools will be required to wear masks on buses and in common areas like hallways when classes resume on Sept. 10.

The provincial government says masks will also be required whenever students and teachers are outside their learning group and cannot maintain an appropriate physical distance.

Students who can't wear masks for medical reasons will be exempt from the updated health and safety guidelines.

Note to readers: This is a corrected story. A previous version said the average class size of 22.4 students was only for Grade 12."

The flights are:

Aug. 2: Air Canada flight 210 from Vancouver to Calgary (affected rows not reported)

Aug. 3: Air Canada flight 561 from San Francisco to Vancouver (affected rows: 18 to 24)

Aug. 3: KLM flight 682 from Vancouver to Amsterdam (affected rows: 38 to 44)

Aug. 11: WestJet flight 720 from Vancouver to Toronto (affected rows: 4 to 11)

Aug. 11: Air Canada flight 116 from Vancouver to Toronto (affected rows: 39 to 45)

In total, 13 flights have since been added to the BCCDC’s public exposure webpage.

The federal government removes information older than 14 days – the quarantine period for those who may have been exposed – from its list.

When asked by the News Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Provincial Health Services Authority, which oversees the BCCDC, said the agency believes the discrepancy likely occurred because the passengers who contracted the virus aren’t B.C. residents, and that “the province or territory in which these cases reside notified the Public Health Agency of Canada about the exposure, but not the BCCDC.”

“BCCDC staff are connecting with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) to ask that they be notified whenever PHAC becomes aware of an exposure on a flight with an origin or destination in B.C. to prevent this situation from occurring in the future,"" said spokesperson Jane Campbell in an emailed statement.

Typically, said Campbell, flights where exposures may have occurred are identified by the province or territory that’s managing the case during its investigation and contact tracing.

BCCDC adds flights to its public exposures webpage once they are identified as health officials investigate the COVID-19 case, or when the agency is alerted to an exposure on a flight by another province or territory.

The federal government is also warning of COVID-19 exposure on an international flight from the Philippines to Vancouver:

Parents are asked to submit questions for the townhall ahead of time to communications@sd40.bc.ca.

Hachlaf, in a letter to school district parents, students and staff on Aug. 18, noted the district has been working on its return-to-school plans against the backdrop of Ministry of Education guidelines.

Those guidelines have continued to evolve since the school restart plan was first announced July 29 – including a recent directive for mandatory mask use in shared and busy spaces for middle school and secondary school students.

“We know you still have many questions,” Hachlaf said. “We know the uncertainty, particularly around this next stage, can be challenging.”

Hachlaf said the district is working to craft a plan that provides as much flexibility as possible, using the small size of the district to “capitalize on opportunities, while acknowledging where it also presents limits.”

The district’s back-to-school plan must be submitted to the Ministry of Education for review and approval by Friday, Aug. 21. The plan will then be publicly released no later than Wednesday, Aug. 26.

“While we work hard to build the plan for our district’s schools, we know that each family faces its own set of individual challenges in this crisis, from acute and existing health concerns to the varying levels of caution being taken,” Hachlaf said. “Next week’s communication will also outline the alternatives we’re working hard to provide for families, including defining relevant information people will need to consider when deciding what will be best for their kids and individual household needs.”

The district is also organizing a student townhall for Aug. 27.

Staff will return to schools on Tuesday, Sept. 8 for two days of orientation and set-up before students return on Sept. 10. Both Thursday, Sept. 10 and Friday, Sept. 11 will be shortened days for student orientation, and regular schedules will begin on Monday, Sept. 14.

Kindergarten students will still have a gradual entry process, as usual; individual schools will send out those plans to parents.

“B.C. should be pursuing a remote learning model that would allow for in-class and remote learning, especially for medically complex children,” Mooring added. “It’s important that this option maintains students’ connection to their local school.”

Richmond parents have been expressing the same concerns over the past week - especially that there are no remote-learning options - with a petition garnering more than 800 signatures.

Parents are worried if they don’t send their children to school out of concern their families will contract COVID-19, they will be left with few options.

Mooring claims timetables are being developed with teachers and support staff expected to be in classes of up to 30 students, without physical barriers or face coverings.

“Physical distancing is not possible in these classrooms,” Mooring said. “The situation will be particularly worrisome in B.C.’s largest and fastest growing districts that have hundreds of portables. Many B.C. schools also have outdated ventilation systems and thousands of students will be in classrooms without external windows.”

The K-12 restart plan is too dense for physical distancing, Mooring said, adding it’s not possible to have a group of 30 17-year-olds in a “typical classroom” and still physically distance.

“B.C. needs to reduce classroom density and mandate mask use whenever appropriate physical distancing isn’t possible,” Mooring said. “That includes our workspaces like classrooms, labs, and libraries—not just common spaces like hallways. B.C. teachers are workers, just like any other profession in this province, and they need to be safe.”"

Health authorities performed about 10,500 COVID-19 tests over three days from Friday through Monday, said B.C.
“Health authorities are at the moment looking at their demand for testing and ensuring that the availability of testing is increased in every region, in every health authority,” ­Gustafson said.
In the Island Health region, 45,135 tests have been performed, with 266 performed on Aug. 17.
“After contacting Island Health’s call centre, generally, the maximum wait time to access a COVID-19 test is two days,” said Island Health.","The number of people with active COVID-19 infections hit an all-time high for a second straight day on Tuesday with 775 people fighting the virus in the province.

The surge was reflected in longer wait times of up to 90 minutes for calls to the province’s 811 COVID-19 ­information line, many from people seeking tests.

“We have had a rapid increase in the demand for testing over the last few weeks or the last week or so and we are seeing some delay in the ramp up of that capacity,” said deputy provincial health officer Dr. Reka Gustafson.

“But I can assure you that all health authorities are working very hard to make sure that that capacity is there and that people can receive the test when they need it.”

Two more cases of COVID-19 were announced in the Island Health region on Tuesday for a total of 156 to date.

There are now seven active cases in the Island Health region. Of the 156 people who have tested positive, 144 have recovered and five have died.

Health authorities performed about 10,500 COVID-19 tests over three days from Friday through Monday, said B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix.

Part of the logistics is ­measuring public demand and ensuring facilities can meet demand, but not having facilities ready for 5,000 tests a day when 2,000 are needed, for example, Dix said. “We’ve seen an increase,” said Dix, explaining that over the past weekend there was a demand for about 3,500 tests a day.

There’s capacity in B.C. for 8,000 tests a day, according to the Health Ministry.

The province is working on testing capacity in two ways — in the laboratory where the specimen is tested, and in health authorities where appointments for testing are made and nasal swabs are performed.

“Health authorities are at the moment looking at their demand for testing and ensuring that the availability of testing is increased in every region, in every health authority,” ­Gustafson said.

Island Health said the backlog with testing is not in the drive-through pre-booked appointments but rather at the call centre where a long phone wait is characterized as 60 to 90 minutes — the time it could take to speak with a clerk or nurse when call volume is high, generally in the morning.

That wait has been exacerbated this week by technical problems that saw calls dropped Tuesday. The health authority is working with its telecommunications company to make fixes.

The number of people infected with COVID-19 in the Island Health region is almost evenly split between the three regions of the Island — south, central, and north — with the fewest in the central region.

Unlike other health authorities, where people can drop in to a centre for assessment and testing, people in the Island Health region are booked for appointments through a family care provider or the call centre.

The COVID call centre, at 1-844-901-8442, is open ­Monday through Saturday 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and is closed on ­Sundays.

There are two testing centres in the south Island, at the Victoria Health Unit, 1947 Cook St., and the Peninsula Health Unit, 2170 Mount Newton X Road, Saanichton; others are in the central and north Island.

In the Island Health region, 45,135 tests have been performed, with 266 performed on Aug. 17.

Testing is recommended for people with these symptoms: fever, chills, cough or worsening of chronic cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, runny nose, loss of sense of smell or taste, headache, fatigue, diarrhea, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, or muscle aches. Less common symptoms include a stuffy nose, conjunctivitis (pink eye), dizziness, confusion, abdominal pain, skin rashes or discolouration of fingers or toes.

“After contacting Island Health’s call centre, generally, the maximum wait time to access a COVID-19 test is two days,” said Island Health.

The turnaround time for results is generally within 24 hours.

Anyone who is concerned that they may have been exposed to, or is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 can use the self-assessment tool at covid19.thrive.health before phoning 811.

In B.C., people who do not have symptoms are not being tested.

Vancouver Island University, for example, will require students returning from abroad to quarantine in designated residence rooms, while the University of Victoria expects students to quarantine off campus.

More than 3,000 international students are registered for the upcoming school year at UVic, a number similar to last year. But that does not indicate how many will be travelling to Greater Victoria from abroad to study, as some may study online and others might have stayed in Canada through the pandemic.

Forty-three international students have reserved spaces in on-campus residences, and the university is in the process of connecting with them to determine where they’re coming from and whether they’ll need to quarantine, said Rose-Marie Roxburgh, associate director of business operations in Residence Services.

No one will be allowed to quarantine in residence, she said.

Roxburgh said the university has been in touch with students to make sure they are aware of the quarantine period, which needs to be completed prior to move-in day on Sept. 6.

“And I’ve been working with International Student Services, to arrange for options like hotels,” she said.

The number of available residence beds has been reduced from around 2,300 to 800 this year, and no one will be sharing a room to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19. Residence spaces are available to all students, regardless of whether they’ll be learning in classrooms or online.

At Vancouver Island University, any student coming from abroad to study in a program that involves in-person learning is required to quarantine in residence, whether or not they intend to live on campus.

“Our No. 1 priority is supporting our students and keeping our community safe and we have a robust plan in place that follows the most current guidelines,” said Ian Johnsrude, VIU’s manager of student housing.

The university has dedicated 20 residence spaces for students in quarantine, and seven beds have been booked, Johnsrude said.

Individuals will receive three meals a day delivered to their door and have their own bathroom.

The quarantine program costs between $50 to $60 a night.

Johnsrude said many international students are in online programs that do not require them to travel to Canada, and some were already in the country before the pandemic began and stayed.

That’s the case for the vast majority of international students at Camosun College, said Geoff Wilmshurst, who is responsible for non-government funded programs at the college, like international education.

Of about 1,300 international students enrolled in the fall, only around 50 people — who already had study permits — are coming from abroad, and there will be virtually no international first-year students on campus, because they weren’t able to get study permits, Wilmshurst said.

Camosun staff have identified hotels for students who need to quarantine, and will provide a hamper filled with food and essential toiletries to help them get through the two-week period. Staff will be checking in with students periodically during the quarantine period, Wilmshurst said.

“We’re feeling that we put everything in place that we know we’re required to put in place to have a safe start to the school year,” he said.

Faced with the reality of gigs drying up due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Levesque did a quick pivot from indoor club queen to backyard superstar.

Borrowing a friend's RV camper, he hit the road with Miss Conception's trademark ""costume change"" performances, which showcase the queen tearing off one dazzling outfit to reveal another underneath. As many as eight costumes are layered over each other, running the gamut of female icons, from the Golden Girls to Peggy Bundy.

The first show on the 13-stop tour was booked by a couple who gathered their whole family in Cobourg, Ont. to witness the spectacle.

""We pulled right into the backyard, I set up the sound system and literally came right out of the RV, like Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,"" Levesque remembered.

""I did my Disney show and kept it all PG. It was just really great to see people smiling again.""

Drag queens who innovate during the COVID slowdown will be the ones who find the greatest success, suggested Levesque. And after months of dejection for much of the drag community, Miss Conception's backyard shows may have offered a runway to the future.

Shortly after they wrapped earlier this summer, Levesque began drafting more grandiose plans to launch Miss Conception's Drive-in Drag Show tour at outdoor theatres across Ontario, with a lineup of veteran queens joining the bill. Once that's over, he's planning to go even bigger with a national drive-in tour that stretches from Newfoundland to British Columbia next year.

""A lot of drag queens were like, 'Meh, we're just gonna sit at home and grow a beard,'"" he said of the early days of the virus.

""But I was like, 'No, I can't do this.' I mean, we live for the applause, like that quote from Lady Gaga's song.""

Levesque is accustomed to the hustle of live entertainment, having worked for two decades in Canada's drag community. But he recognizes that COVID has thrown shade on many of his drag sisters who've lost regular paying gigs.

It wasn't supposed to be this way.

Heading into 2020, the country's drag scene seemed postured for a banner year. The debut season of Crave's competition series ""Canada's Drag Race"" was already shining a spotlight on homegrown performers, and the attention was radiating to others in the community who weren't even part of the ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" spinoff.

Some LGBTQ bars and restaurants were looking forward to a new generation of drag fans crowding into their establishments for ""Canada's Drag Race"" viewing parties. And many local queens hoped to capitalize on mainstream interest with paid appearances at community and corporate events over the summer.

But many of those dreams failed to materialize when physical distancing rules went into effect to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Jason Pelletier, who performs as Jezebel Bardot, was among those who had rosy hopes for a blockbuster year.

In the weeks before the pandemic shut-down, he shot a music video with Calgary-based country music quartet Nice Horse, giving the ladies a makeover to the tune of their single ""Hot Mess."" Trixie Mattel, a favourite on ""RuPaul's Drag Race,"" dipped in for a cameo, making it certain the clip would be seen beyond Canada.

""I remember in February and March thinking this is the year — things are finally rolling in,"" Pelletier said.

""And when March hit it was all downhill.""

Few queens felt the pandemic's fallout quite like the cast of ""Canada's Drag Race,"" who were eagerly awaiting the show's debut in July. With episodes available on Crave nationwide, and internationally in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries, the global exposure was unprecedented.

When Sheldon McIntosh learned his persona Tynomi Banks was selected as one of the competitors, he knew his schedule would quickly fill up with meet-and-greets and club appearances.

""Me and my sisters were on the edge of our seats,"" McIntosh explained.

""But when COVID hit, honestly, we were just devastated. There was an overwhelming sense of loss.""

Live performances were cancelled and major drag conventions postponed, leaving many of the queens to wonder if their stunning new outfits would even leave the closet.

McIntosh said after several weeks of sadness, he followed the lead of other popular queens by taking Tynomi Banks online for live performances.

""I use the living room where we have this long wall,"" he said. ""Thank the Lord we bought a big black curtain... so it looks like a makeshift stage.""

Slowly, some of Canada's LGBTQ-friendly venues are now reopening and booking performers on their patios and indoor stages.

But as winter looms so do questions about a second wave of the virus sending everyone back into isolation.

Devion Farley, known on stage as Devine Darlin, said those uncertainties were crippling in the early stages of COVID. After his tours in Europe and Mexico were cancelled, he slipped into a depression. It wasn't until a local food delivery service contacted him about pairing up for a cooking show that his creativity started to flourish again.

Every week, Darlin would appear on Instagram Live when a mystery meal kit arrived at her doorstep. The challenge was to make a delicious dish from the ingredients inside the box.

""I like to cook and I like to eat,"" Farley said.

""It's something that people don't see me do, so I wanted to welcome them into my kitchen and let them see the fun I have.""

In a human experiment like no other since the pandemic was declared in March,

more than 600,000 students, teachers and staff are expected to resume classes in B.C. as part of the government’s kindergarten to Grade 12 back-to-school plan.

It is not, as Premier John Horgan told reporters Aug. 12, a plan that is without concerns from government, which continues to say restarting in-class instruction is the right thing to do for a child’s social, academic and mental development.

“I’m excited about it,” Horgan said. “Am I apprehensive? Sure, but I think that we can go into this with the best of intentions and have the best outcomes, if we all work together.”

Horgan made those comments the day before Lisa Descary, who teaches math and science at Steveston-London secondary school in Richmond, participated in a small protest outside Health Minister Adrian Dix’s constituency office on Joyce Street in Vancouver.

She was there with other teachers, parents and a student concerned about the plan. Dix, at the time, was in Victoria with Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry releasing more COVID-19 data, announcing 78 new cases.

“It is going against everything that Dr. Bonnie Henry has told us we need to do to flatten the [epidemiological] curve,” said Descary, while holding a sign calling for smaller class sizes. “Instead of less faces in larger spaces, it’s putting more student faces in poorly ventilated, under-funded, crowded indoor spaces, and I’m terrified.”

Stacey Wakelin, who organized the protest with former Vancouver school trustee Carrie Bercic, has a son going into Grade 12 and a daughter about to start Grade 10 at R.E. Mountain secondary in Langley.

Wakelin is a coordinator of the SafeSeptemberBC.com website and Facebook group that have worked as sounding boards for parents around the province concerned about sending their children back to school.

Parents, she said, want changes to the plan, which are being voiced in a letter to Education Minister Rob Fleming. They’re asking for a two-week delay to reopen schools to better understand the guidelines, to make masks mandatory when feasible, to reduce class sizes and offer blended learning options for students.

Wakelin’s husband has contacted the Langley school district about an online option for the couple’s children, or a model similar to the one in June where students returned for a couple of days while the balance of instruction was done online.

“I would really like my kids back in school,” she said. “That’s what I’m hoping to see. My son has gone through his entire school career with a lot of these kids, and I’d like him to be able to finish it.”

The “mixed messaging” from Henry and government is what troubles Wakelin, who emphasized she has had the utmost respect for Henry and Dix until the back-to-school plan was released July 29.

“I can’t go into a store without a mask on, I can’t throw a party with more than 50 people, but we can send our kids back [to school],” she said. “I don’t get it.”

The B.C. government will spend $45.6 million to implement the plan, which includes enhanced cleaning of schools, adding hand-washing stations, providing reusable masks and other safety measures.

In recent weeks, when questions have arisen about the government’s plan, Henry has said she doesn’t “necessarily expect there to be [COVID-19] cases in schools” but that it was “inevitable there probably will be some.”

Current worldwide data on COVID-19 has shown a very low infection rate in people 19 years old and under, and even lower in children under the age of 10, according to government.

Data from Canada’s Public Health Agency shows more than 9,500 people aged 19 or younger out of 119,505 cases reviewed had tested positive for COVID-19 in the country, as of Aug. 17.

That data became available the same day the B.C. government announced that masks will be required for staff, middle and secondary students in high traffic areas such as on buses and in hallways, “or anytime outside of their learning group whenever physical distancing cannot be maintained.”

Masks will not be required in classrooms.

Henry has cautioned masks are “an additional layer on top of the other layers that we use to keep each other safe, and it is the least effective of the many layers that we have.”

Physical distancing and keeping gatherings of people small are more effective measures to prevent transmission of the disease, she said in a July 23 briefing to reporters.

The government’s plan calls for students to be placed in “learning groups” of no more than 60 at elementary and middle schools, and a maximum of 120 at high schools to reduce the number of close, in-person interactions.

It will be up to each of B.C.’s 60 school districts to tailor the plan to meet the ministry’s guidelines. That could prove challenging for districts with large school populations, most of which are in Metro Vancouver.

Sixteen high schools in the province have student populations between 1,500 and 2,000, including Terry Fox secondary in Port Coquitlam.

That’s where Josh Czeto, who lives in Pitt Meadows, is a student and looking to begin his Grade 12 year. Czeto said he doesn’t want to return, saying he would prefer an online option similar to what students transitioned to in March.

Josh Czeto and his mother Florence from Pitt Meadows attended a recent protest outside Health Minister Adrian Dix’s constituency office in Vancouver - Mike Howell



He and his mother Florence attended the rally outside Dix’s office, with Czeto saying his concern about learning in a classroom is shared by friends, who fear a return to school could lead to more transmission of COVID-19.

“One of the bigger worries with my friends is that there are these types of people in schools who don’t care about COVID, who don’t think it’s real,” he said, holding a sign calling for online schooling. “I don’t want to take that chance with the general public, to be honest. I think it’s ridiculous to make people take that chance. Seems like the only people who are not on board with this are the people who have to show up, like the teachers and the students.”

An emailed statement from the Ministry of Education was provided to Glacier Media in place of an interview with Fleming in response to concerns raised by teachers, parents and students.

The statement, which repeated most of what was announced in the back-to-school plan, emphasized that B.C. was the only jurisdiction in Canada that returned students to the classroom in June “and this has given us valuable information that we are using to develop our plans, ensuring health and safety at schools remain paramount.”

Teachers and staff are scheduled to return Sept. 8, before students arrive Sept. 10 and 11 to understand what learning during a pandemic will look like in their schools.

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

article continues below

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

This latest extension will end on Sept. 1 and allows the government to manage immediate concerns, such as recent outbreaks in some areas of the province.

Premier John Horgan says B.C. residents have made sacrifices to keep transmission rates down, but now unsafe gatherings are eroding that progress.

The province announced 83 new cases on Tuesday for a total of 4,677 cases since the pandemic began.

No new deaths were reported, leaving the total number of fatalities at 198.

There are 775 active cases in B.C. and 2,326 people under monitoring because they have been exposed to someone who has been infected with COVID-19.

In a statement, Horgan says the government is committed to getting back on track and it will announce new enforcement measures against those who put others at risk.

The credit reporting agency said in a quarterly report that credit card balances fell 12.3 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period a year ago.

Reduced opportunities for spending during the lockdown may have contributed to the drop, said TransUnion's Matt Fabian, but he also noted that people are dipping into savings or retirement funds rather than relying on credit cards.

""Recent feedback from our survey seems like the folks that say they're still experiencing a lot of financial hardship continues to drop. And there's a lot more certainty in terms of the response, in terms of what they're going to do. Consumers have fortified themselves,"" said Fabian.

TransUnion uses the credit bureaus' national consumer credit database as source material for its quarterly report.

Applications for new credit also grew at a slower-than-usual pace amid reduced access to branches during the lockdown, uncertainty around employment and a pullback on new offers from lenders.

The report did note that credit balances for Millennials and Gen Z consumers grew 0.8 per cent and 5.9 per cent, respectively, as those consumers have less buffer in the form of savings, investments or retirement funds. Overall instalment loan debt also rose by 3.9 per cent in the second quarter to $175.4 billion, up from $168.8 billion a year ago.

Mortgage debt is on the rise, TransUnion said, with new mortgages, renewals and refinances up 29 per cent from a year ago and a 5.3 per cent annual increase in the total volume of mortgage debt.

""The spring, that's usually the big mortgage season or the big home buying season. With people not being able to go out, and constraints around travelling and visiting homes and looking at new homes, once some of those lock downs were lifted, we've seen sort of a real surge,"" Fabian said.

""Certainly for some consumers that have existing mortgages, deferrals were an option, and a lot of consumers opted to take it … certainly for a lot of people, a mortgage might be one of the biggest monthly or biweekly expenses that they'd have.""

Despite a 4.3 per cent rise in total outstanding debt in Canada, which stood at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter, Fabian says delinquencies have risen less than expected, as about 2.6 million Canadians, or 9.2 per cent of credit consumers, have at least one active deferral.

Delinquencies also were on the rise for personal loans, which TransUnion noted are ""partly fuelled by alternative lenders who have been slightly more aggressive in issuing personal loans to below prime consumers.""

""We have seen delinquency rates go up a little bit, but a lot less than we had expected… and I think part of that is the deferral and forbearance processes that are in place with the lenders as well as the support from the government,"" said Fabian.

""Delinquency tends to be a long-tail thing where it takes a while. People have exhaust all their options before they will start to continuously skip and miss payments. As deferrals come off and the government subsidization ends, we expect to see some delinquency spike.""

“We cannot let a few wreck it for everybody else, and that is the reason why action is being taken,” said Dix, speaking from Vancouver Monday afternoon during the latest COVID-19 update.

While he didn’t provide details, Dix said the government will be “taking further steps to impose stricter penalties,” and the plan will “optimize” the use of enforcement officers outside of public health, for example, municipalities, police departments and WorkSafe BC.

Dix said the plan will come into effect later this week, once it’s announced by B.C. Solicitor General Mike Farnworth.

B.C. recorded 236 new COVID-19 cases between Friday and Monday, including 100 cases on Saturday – the largest single-day jump so far. There are now 743 active cases in the province.

Since late June, the majority of new cases have been driven by young people in their 20s and 30s.

A string of public exposure alerts has been issued recently for restaurants, bars, night clubs and stores across the Lower Mainland.

And over the weekend, videos emerged of large gatherings – with little social distancing – including drum circles and a late-night street party in Vancouver.

However, Dix said that the “greatest danger” remains private, indoor parties.

“We are continuing to review what can be done about those, and continuing to engage with people and discourage people from hosting such gatherings,” he said.

Dix said that while 50 is the maximum number of people permitted at a gathering in B.C., however, depending on the event and the location, the number of guests that is safe could be “considerably” lower."

""Find out more about what your school district is doing, and then adjust according to that.","TORONTO — Vonny Sweetland has yet to decide if he will be sending his 12-year-old sister Josephine back to class in September, but just in case he does, he's been stocking up on supplies for months.

He picks up hand sanitizer when he sees it in stores, grabbed new masks last month, bought a fresh uniform and has been testing out Josephine's muscle power with some new lunch containers.

The new additions to her backpack and are all part of a wave of changes families — and their wallets — are being confronted with as they prepare for back to school, whether it's sourcing protective equipment or choosing a thermos their child can open unassisted.

""In a COVID-era, all of these things we take for granted or think are minuscule are actually really important,"" said Sweetland, who is his sister's guardian.

""These are things as simple as a teacher helping you unpack your lunch or zipping a zipper. To prevent potential spread, I don't think teachers are really going to be doing these things.""

The cost of so many new supplies can easily add up.

A Deloitte survey of 1,200 parents who have at least one child attending school in grades K-12 this fall found the average family will spend $102 on school supplies, $216 on clothing and accessories, $395 on computers and hardware, $316 on electronic gadgets and digital subscriptions.

The survey, which was conducted between May and July, found those families will allocate $61 on a new category: home or health supplies.

Even so, back-to-school shopping doesn't have to be more expensive than any other year, said Seung Hwan (Mark) Lee, an associate professor of retail management at Ryerson University.

He recommends shoppers compare prices and take advantage of sales.

Anne Marie Taber said she's noticed plenty of sales, though she hasn't sought them out when shopping with seven-year-old daughter Avery because she tries to minimize her time in stores and instead use online options with delivery to lessen her exposure to the virus.

She stocked up as soon as she could on Old Navy's uniform-style clothing because several sizes were out of stock and also grabbed Avery a new backpack.

On top of masks and hand sanitizers, they bought a wide-mouth water bottle without a straw to make cleaning easy, plastic Duo-Tangs that can be wiped down and a set of art supplies that Avery has been reminded not to share.

""This is extra stuff we haven't had to buy in the past but it's a small dollar to pay to make sure that that is just hers exclusively,"" Taber said.

Parents may also want to consider disposable cutlery, if they have children that bring lunches to school and are worried about germs spreading through anything reuseable, Lee said.

If your child is doing virtual classes, he suggests ensuring you have a reliable laptop or tablet with a webcam.

Those who want to go all out or are older and have specific needs for programs they are enrolled in, may need to think about microphones and speakers too.

Those supplies don't come cheap. However, the cost of those high-ticket items could be partially offset by a change he sees happening across universities and colleges during the pandemic.

""It's no longer really about carrying around the heavy textbooks,"" he said.

""Many professors aren't holding lengthy exams because the exams are becoming very difficult to monitor and you can't really get a proctor to look at how students are conducting their exams... so using test banks or textbooks no longer apply.""

If you're feeling anxious or stressed about back to school shopping and advertisements are making you feel you better get to a store soon, Lee says not worry.

""I would advise parents right now not to rush into getting supplies,"" he said.

""Find out more about what your school district is doing, and then adjust according to that. A deal can always be had.""

It may also embolden other federal opposition parties to join the Bloc Quebecois in its determination to bring down Justin Trudeau's government at the first opportunity. That opportunity will arise sooner than expected with the prime minister's announcement Tuesday that Parliament is being prorogued and will return Sept. 23 with a throne speech. A vote on the speech will be a test of confidence in the government.

For that matter, Higgs' example may embolden Trudeau to pull the plug himself.

And it has NDP democratic reform critic Daniel Blaikie appealing to his counterparts in other federal parties to begin discussing now how best to safely conduct a federal election during the pandemic rather than sleepwalk into potential chaos.

""The worst thing would be to get to the point where we're saying, 'OK, we're having an election' and then having these disputes about the process and having somebody within the political system decide that it's in their best interests to start assailing the legitimacy of the process that's already under way,"" he said in an interview.

Without some all-party consensus on how to conduct an election safely, Blaikie fears Canada could wind up in a situation similar to the United States, where Donald Trump is making unsubstantiated assertions that mail-in ballots will result in rampant voter fraud during November's presidential election.

""We don't need a political crisis on top of a public health and economic crisis,"" he said.

As part of its preparations for a possible election during the pandemic, Elections Canada has set up an internal working group to assess the agency's ability to conduct the vote safely — including its capacity to handle mail-in ballots, find alternative polling station locations and keep both voters and poll workers safe.

But there's only so much Elections Canada can do under current law. In a post on its website about the impact of the pandemic on election planning, the agency notes for instance that Parliament would have to change the Canada Elections Act to allow for an election to be conducted entirely by mail-in ballots.

And it adds this warning: ""In an extreme case, based on the advice of public health experts, the chief electoral officer could certify that it has become impracticable for Elections Canada to administer the election in one or more electoral districts and recommend to the governor-in-council (the governor general on the advice of cabinet) that the election writ be withdrawn.

""This has never been done in Elections Canada's history.""

It's that warning that particularly worries Blaikie. His nightmare scenario is that the government is defeated or Trudeau chooses to call an election, the governor general duly dissolves Parliament ""and then Elections Canada says, 'We're actually not sure we can do this.'""

""So then you have a dissolved Parliament, you have an executive with no Parliament to hold it to account and how long does that go on? ... If that is a possibility, I think it's one we should all be very concerned about.""

Back on June 25, Blaikie wrote his counterparts in the other federal parties asking that they work together to find a way to ensure an election can be conducted safely during the pandemic with a process that is ""politically legitimate.""

No one has so far responded to his letter.

""I find it kind of shocking that we've got people out there talking really strongly about wanting an election and the conditions under which they would precipitate an election when we don't actually know how to have an election properly right now.""

Higgs predicted Monday that New Brunswick will have little difficulty pulling off a safe election, albeit one in which candidates don't go door-to-door or hand out pamphlets.

With fewer than 200 cases of COVID-19 and just two deaths since March, New Brunswick has been relatively unscathed by the virus, which has infected more than 122,000 and killed more than 9,000 countrywide. Moreover, the pandemic is in something of a lull at the moment - which may no longer be the case later in the fall when the Trudeau government's fate could be on the line.

The province's chief electoral officer, Kim Poffenroth, said her agency has instituted a number of measures to ensure voters' and electoral workers' safety. Among them: marking the floors at polling stations to keep voters at least two-meters apart, requiring the use of hand sanitizer when voters enter and exit polling stations, providing disposable masks to electors, requiring workers to wear masks or face shields and hiring additional workers to manage the flow of voters and to clean high-touch surfaces.

As well, she said Elections New Brunswick has cancelled polling stations in long-term care and seniors' homes and will make it easier for residents in those facilities to vote by mail. It has also stocked up on mail-in ballots.

However, should a second surge of COVID-19 cases erupt before Sept. 14, Poffenroth conceded it could impact voter turnout.

""We may have even greater challenges finding workers to work at the polls and then we may run into problems with the owners of buildings where we're supposed to have polling locations not wanting us to use those locations.""

But regardless of how difficult it might become to administer the election, Poffenroth has no legal authority to recommend that it be called off - unlike Canada's chief electoral officer, Stephane Perrault.

""There's really no playbook for how to do this,"" she said. ""It's a learning curve for both ourselves and other election management bodies across the country and we just happen to be the first ones out the gate.""

The recently retired Winnipeg Blue Bombers superfan was hoping to fill up his summer schedule with football games.

""All hell broke loose,"" he said Tuesday.

He was disappointed to learn his team won't be able to defend its Grey Cup championship this year. However, he's not letting the CFL's decision to scrap the season affect his unbroken streak — he is considering 2020 a lost year.

""It's not my fault they aren't playing this year, so I'm going to consider my streak alive,"" he said. ""If it was happening this year in Regina, I would be going.""

Fans across the league shared in the sadness of the lost year after commissioner Randy Ambrosie announced the decision to cancel the 2020 season and focus on 2021.

There was hope Winnipeg — home of the 2019 champions — could serve as a hub city for the league. But the CFL was unable to secure financing from the federal government or resolve some other issues.

It marks the first year the Grey Cup won't be presented since 1919.

Fan Mike Goodchild had a lot more time for vacation and house projects this summer in Manitoba, but said he'd rather be watching football games.

""We miss going to the games, watching our favourite players,"" Goodchild said Tuesday. ""It is what it is right now.""

That the Bombers remain the reigning champions is a small silver lining to the news, Emile Morrissette said. The Manitoba team won its 11th CFL championship with a 33-12 victory against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats last November, ending a 29-year drought.

Morrissette, a season ticket holder, wanted to see what the champions would have done to defend the title on the field.

""Finally we win the Grey Cup and we have a very competitive team and we are probably going into the season to be one of the favourites again and then that COVID hit,"" Morrissette said.

""You know, it just makes it tough as a fan.""

Some people plan their summers around the cottage or the beach, but Morrissette and his sister make their plans around going to football games together.

He supports the decision if the league can become stronger and more financially stable for future seasons.

In Saskatchewan, Nelson Hackewich said he was expecting the season would be cancelled, but it was still hard to hear.

""The league was in a situation where it couldn't win. It was going to lose money either way,"" he said. ""It still hurts that we aren't going to have CFL football this year.""

To say the Hackewich family are Saskatchewan Roughriders fans is an understatement — they bleed green and white, he said. They are known for the Rider Room in his parents' Regina house. They converted Hackewich's childhood bedroom into a place to showcase decades of Roughriders memorabilia.

To fill the hole left by the season, Hackewich began simulating the CFL season using a video game and livestreaming it online. Each Friday, he gets about 8,000 viewers. But it's not quite the same as watching the game, he said.

It also feels like a bit of salt in the wound for Hackewich that the season was cancelled the year the Roughriders' top rivals — the Bombers — hold the Cup.

""They ended one of the longest droughts in CFL history and the league decided they were going to shut it down... It's all Winnipeg's fault,"" Hackewich said with a friendly laugh.

Morrissette responded from Winnipeg that it better not be another curse on the Bombers.

""They won the Cup and then the season gets cancelled, right? It's kind of weird,"" he said. ""But technically I can never agree with a Rider fan. That's just in the DNA.""

The prime minister shared his uncertainty during a news conference on Parliament Hill on Tuesday, only weeks before classes in Ontario and much of the rest of the country are set to resume after being suspended in the spring due to the pandemic.

""Like so many parents, that's something we are in very active discussions on,"" Trudeau said outside the House of Commons, where he announced that Parliament was being prorogued after a small cabinet shuffle.

""We are looking at what the schools' plans are, we're looking at class sizes, we're looking at how the kids are feeling about wearing masks. All my friends as parents are asking these same questions.""

A new survey by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies suggested the majority of parents plan to send their kids to school, but that most would want classes cancelled if there is a new COVID-19 outbreak in their community.

Those results suggested many parents are torn, with 66 per cent of respondents with children saying they were worried about children returning to school but 63 per cent saying they planned to send their kids anyway.

Yet 69 per cent also felt all classes should be suspended and learning shifted back to home if there is a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in their community, with 19 per cent saying classes should continue and 12 per cent unsure either way.

The online survey of 1,510 Canadians over age 18, including 385 parents with school-aged children in their households, took place Aug. 14-16. An internet poll cannot be given a margin of error because it is not a random sample.

The results underscore the nervousness and sensitivities around the planned reopening of school, says Leger president Jean-Marc Leger, with many parents supporting the return of classes but ready to shut it down again at the drop of a hat.

""People are nervous,"" he said. ""It's a very sensitive question.""

For his part, Trudeau said the federal government is making infrastructure money available for provinces to help retrofit schools and other public buildings to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. But he also acknowledged the concern many parents are feeling.

""I know that lots of parents are going to be watching carefully what their local school boards' plans are,"" he said. ""There is a lot of reflection in a lot of households, including mine, as to what's going to happen when September rolls around.""

The Leger survey also found strong support among respondents with children for requiring certain protections to be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at schools, including 76 per cent who said students should have to wear masks.

The result was not broken down by whether masks should be required for only high school students or students in both high school and elementary. Some provinces such as Ontario are requiring masks for students in certain grades but not others.

Eighty-four per cent of respondents with kids said teachers and school staff should be required to wear masks while 75 per cent supported temperature checks for children and 71 per cent wanted screening questionnaires.

""People are saying: 'OK, we agree. We support the government's initiative. But at the same time, you should ensure that the rules are respected at school,'"" said Leger.

Parents were more divided over what to do if a student or teacher in their kid's class tested positive for COVID-19.

While 24 per cent reported they would keep their kids home from school indefinitely, 35 per cent said they would keep them home for at least 14 days while 33 per cent indicated they would follow the advice of their school on next steps.

Hospitalizations decreased from 12 cases to four.

Deputy provincial health officer Dr. Reka Gustafson said most of those testing positive are young, which suggests the province has done a relatively good job of protecting the most vulnerable.

However, she said young people are more likely to have mild infections and may not realize they have COVID-19 before they spread it to others, adding that severe infections can occur at any age.

Anyone with even a slight symptom should stay home from work and gatherings, and anyone who has been advised that they've been in contact with a case should isolate for 14 days, even if no symptoms develop, she said.

""You could easily spread the virus to someone who is vulnerable.""

The new infections bring the total active cases to 743. There have been 4,594 confirmed cases since the pandemic began.

Two more people have died from the virus for a total of 198 deaths.

While there are no new community outbreaks, the health authority in northern B.C. issued an alert after confirming 17 cases linked to a religious gathering held between July 30 and Aug. 2.

Anyone who attended the It Is Time event in Deadwood, Alta., is asked to monitor themselves, self-isolate and seek testing if any COVID-19 symptoms develop.

""This pandemic is not ending soon, this pandemic that we're all tired of,"" Dix said.

Officials now expect it to continue ""well through 2021 into 2022,"" he added.

""This new normal is going to be in place for a long time and the way that we address that, the way that we deal with that as a society, inevitably, has to be by choice and by engagement.""

Solicitor General Mike Farnworth will announce stricter penalties later this week for those who break public health rules designed to reduce transmission of the novel coronavirus, said Dix.

Officials are most concerned about private parties and Dix urged people to act responsibly.

""The places where there's the greatest danger are private parties where alcohol is involved and it's inside,"" he said.

Dix said surveillance and enforcement also have a role. Several bars, clubs and restaurants have closed both voluntarily and involuntarily following exposures to the virus.

The CFL cancelled its season Monday due to the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning the Grey Cup won't be presented for the first time since 1919.

The decision comes after the CFL was unable to secure financial assistance from the federal government. The league sent Ottawa an amended request Aug. 3 for a $30-million, interest-free loan, but the sides couldn't come to terms on a deal.

It was the CFL's last-ditch effort to stage an abbreviated season in the hub city of Winnipeg. It came after the league asked for $44 million in July.

""I do feel I am responsible for the fact that we are not on the field this year,"" Ambrosie said in a telephone interview. ""But I resolve to learn from what we've experienced and I'm looking forward to a bright future.

""I think we're all watching an example on the world stage today of a leader that takes no responsibility for anything . . . and no matter what happens, I won't be that guy.""

The CFL had maintained it required government funding to stage a shortened season. In late April, Ambrosie told The Canadian Press the league had presented a three-tiered request for financial assistance that began with $30 million initially, more in the event of a shortened season and up to $150 million in the event of a cancelled campaign.

""I regret that . . . I do wish we hadn't thrown that number ($150 million) out,"" Ambrosie said. ""We never asked for $150 million, at least I don't feel we did.

""What we did was aggregate what we thought was the worst-case scenario . . . and we said, 'In the end our problem could be as big as $150 million,' but that became the number.""

Ambrosie had stated the CFL collectively lost around $20 million last season. With no football in 2020, a source familiar with the situation said the league will lose between $60 and $80 million this year.

Ambrosie said he was at a loss to explain why the CFL and government couldn't come to a suitable financial arrangement. But two league sources said the $30-million request fell through when the assistance couldn't be provided to the league under the terms it sought.

The sources were granted anonymity because the league and government haven't discussed certain financial figures publicly.

Last month, the CFL ruled out a loan from the Business Development Bank of Canada because it felt the interest rate was too high.

""I think there were at least a couple of times when for really good reasons we felt like we were on track to be able to do something with the government,"" Ambrosie said. ""And it didn't happen.

""I feel a sense of disappointment but not anger, just sorrow that something that I thought would come together didn't happen.""

Another requirement for an abbreviated season was the CFL and CFL Players' Association agreeing on an amended collective bargaining agreement. The CFL said it was close to a deal when it called off the season Monday.

That's what made the CFL's decision Monday so surprising to CFLPA president Solomon Elimimian.

""It's definitely disappointing and yes, we were surprised,"" said Elimimian, a Saskatchewan Roughriders linebacker. ""We felt like we were making tremendous progress . . . things were moving in a way that led me to optimism, led all of us to optimism.

""From that aspect, when the news came it was definitely tough.""

Six of the CFL's nine teams are privately owned by either wealthy individuals or organizations. However, none stepped up to provide the funds necessary for a shortened season.

""They have complicated businesses outside of their CFL ownership and all of those things have been affected as well (by the pandemic),"" Ambrosie said. ""I don't think it would be fair to harshly judge them when frankly they give and they give and they give.""

Ambrosie said while he's bitterly disappointed, the CFL and its teams have the luxury of time to plan for the 2021 season. However, there's plenty of uncertainty about next season, most notably if CFL fans will be allowed back in the stands.

The CFL is a gate-driven league and its teams depend heavily upon ticket sales to generate revenue. Ambrosie admits he's concerned about what impact the novel coronavirus will have on his league next season.

""Sure I am concerned but I think this is the challenge we're all facing together,"" he said. ""None of us really know what 2021 is going to look like.

""The optimist in me believes the scientific world is going to create a vaccine and we're going to get back to a more normal world. We'll (prepare) for the best, plan for the worst but I believe that good things will happen. You have to wake up with optimism and frankly that's how I'm going to face the challenge.""

Minister of Canadian Heritage Steven Guilbeault said the government tried to work with the CFL.

""Our government helped the CFL navigate through the existing COVID-19 emergency response programs that are helping tens of thousands of businesses across Canada with revenue and liquidity challenges during this time,"" Guilbeault said in a statement.

""Although the league was able to benefit from some of these programs, its board members ultimately made the decision not to pursue the upcoming season.""

Liberal MP Peter Fragiskatos (London North Centre) supported no federal money going to the CFL.

""The federal government made the right decision here,"" he tweeted. ""While the CFL is a very important part of sport heritage, it is not entitled to special treatment.

""Some fans will be disappointed but the league's ask simply wasn't fair or reasonable.""

With the cancellation, the CFL becomes one of the few major North American pro sports leagues to wipe out play in 2020. Major League Baseball is running a shortened season, while the NHL, NBA and Major League Soccer have resumed play. The NFL says it's planning to start its season on time next month.

Ambrosie has received heavy criticism for his leadership in navigating the CFL through the pandemic. Players routinely took to social media to voice their displeasure with Ambrosie throughout the process and politicians from all major parties criticized the league for not having its players involved in its initial financial assistance request.

However, Ambrosie wants to remain in his post.

""It's been hard and it wouldn't be honest to say that every day since this all started has been a bowl of cherries because it hasn't,"" Ambrosie said. ""I'm committed to this league, I'm committed to its future.

""I'm going to lean in as hard or harder than anything I've done in my career because I think we've got something special and I'd like to be part of it.""

For months, there were fewer than 1,000 people in isolation at any one time. In the space of a week, that number more than doubled.

About three-quarters of these people are in isolation because someone in their family or social or work circles exposed them to the virus. That means there is a growing number of people off work and/or cut off from friends and their community – often through no fault of their own.

Last week’s column was about how our pandemic’s demographics had shifted and that younger people were now picking up the virus in greater numbers than older people.

The sudden explosion in the number of people in isolation is also likely the result of younger people who have the virus exposing more people to it than an older segment of the population because they are generally more socially active and have more personal contacts.

Just when it appeared that B.C. had successfully “bent the curve” when it came to containing the spread of COVID-19, the statistics during the past two weeks have been discouraging.

After averaging about 10 cases a day about a month ago, the daily average as of this column’s writing has been more than 80. And those in isolation continue to climb in number.

However, in a glass-half-full sort of way, three other key statistics continue to offer hope. Thankfully, we have not seen a spike in hospitalizations, critical care cases or deaths.

Since the pandemic was declared, we have had fewer than 600 people in hospital so far. And fewer than 200 people were placed in the ICU.

At our worst point, there were 149 people in the hospital and 72 of them were in the ICU. We have come a long way from those grim days, but we can easily go backwards if we do not do more when it comes to following public health rules and guidelines.

Stop the partying everyone. We do not need more and more people put into isolation, cut off from their everyday world.

The “modelling” of B.C.’s COVID-19 situation that was presented by Dr. Bonnie Henry last week included some of the results of that huge survey of the plight of individuals and families in this pandemic and they were eye opening.

Almost 400,000 British Columbians participated in it. the results showed people with lower incomes and those in some ethnic communities have had the worst experiences when it came to job loss, food scarcity and stress on their children.

Will that situation change in the months ahead? It seems unlikely, since our most vulnerable always seem to pay a heavier price in times of trouble.

The country’s collective reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic may have something to do with these numbers, as our medical services have been tested like never before.

The fact that Canadians are proud of the health-care system does not mean that we do not see opportunities for improvement. This month, we asked Canadians about their overall impressions and saw some numbers tending in a positive direction.

article continues below

In January 2019, one in four Canadians (25%) thought Canada’s health-care system worked well and called for minor changes to make it work better. This month, three in 10 Canadians (30%) share this feeling. In British Columbia, the number of residents who agreed with this point of view increased from 30% in 2019 to 35% now.

There is a sizable gender gap when it comes to having near total satisfaction with the health-care system. While 36% of men in Canada feel this way, the proportion falls to 24% among women.

As was the case last year, the bulk of responses (55%) point to Canada’s health-care system having some good things but requiring many changes. Only 9% of Canadians articulate the notion that the health-care system has so much wrong with it that we need to completely rebuild it – including 20% in Atlantic Canada.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a greater appreciation of health-care workers, and Canada has been immune to the equipment shortages that are plaguing other nations. Across the country, three in four Canadians (76%) expressed confidence that the health-care system would be there to provide help and assistance if they had to face an unexpected medical condition. While this represents a three-point drop since January 2019, maintaining this level of assurance in the middle of a pandemic is eye-catching.

There is some fluctuation when Canadians ponder the biggest problems facing the health-care system. Just under a third (31%, down two points since January 2019) point the finger at long wait times. A shortage of doctors and nurses is second on the list with 26%, up eight points and outlining the desperation of Canadians who have endured the retirement or relocation of their family physician.

There is a silver lining on the issue of bureaucracy and poor management, which dropped from 24% last year to 13% in 2020. Fewer Canadians express concerns over inadequate resources and facilities (8%), a lack of focus on preventive care (6%), a lack of a wider range of services for patients (also 6%) and insufficient standards of hygiene (3%).

Not all Canadian provinces react the same when it comes to the challenges the health-care system faces. Quebecers and Ontarians are more likely to cringe at long wait times. British Columbians are torn between delays in delivery and finding a doctor. Alberta has the highest proportion of residents (20%) who blame bureaucracy and poor management, although that is down significantly from what we found in 2019 (33%).

A crisis is palpable in Atlantic Canada, where a shocking 46% of residents say a shortage of doctors and nurses is the main problem. This might explain why one in five residents of these provinces want to completely rebuild the health-care system.

At a time when our focus is starting to shift about how to pay for the assistance that the federal government has authorized for Canadians struggling because of the pandemic, there is little appetite for a reduction in medical expenditures. Three in four Canadians (75%) reject the federal government making cuts to health-care funding to reduce government debt.

We also continue to see few Canadians believing that medical services would be superior under a different framework. Across the country, just 30% of Canadians think health care in Canada would be better than it is now if it were run by the private sector.

Canadians aged 55 and over are less likely to endorse a move towards privatization (22%) than those aged 35 to 54 (29%) and those aged 18 to 34 (37%). The flirtation with a private system is also bigger in Eastern Canada (39% in Quebec, 30% in Ontario and 29% in the Atlantic provinces) than in Western Canada (24% in British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan and 23% in Alberta).

While some countries around the world have seen their health-care systems exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the way Canadians feel about medical services in the country did not go through an overwhelming shift. The desperation from Canadians who are awaiting a meeting with a specialist remains, but fewer than one third believe our health-care delivery should echo what most Americans have. •

BRITISH COLUMBIA

British Columbia has laid out its plan for studies to resume in ""learning groups"" this fall. School districts are to post final back-to-school details online by Aug. 26.

Back to class: Schools were initially scheduled to welcome students back full time on Sept. 8, but the province announced it is pushing back the restart date by two days to Sept. 10.

Groups: Students will be sorted into learning groups to reduce the number of people they come in contact with. For elementary and middle school students, groups will be no larger than 60 people. Secondary school groups will be capped at 120.

Physical distancing: Students and staff don't need to maintain physical distancing within their learning group, but contact should be minimized. Outside the group, physical distancing is required. Students should be more spaced out in classrooms.

Masks: Staff and students at middle and secondary schools will be required to wear masks on buses and in common areas. The provincial government says masks will also be required whenever students and teachers are outside their learning group and cannot maintain an appropriate physical distance. Students who can't wear masks for medical reasons will be exempt.

New routines: The province is urging schools to stagger recess, lunch and class transition times and take students outside whenever possible.

Transportation: Middle and high school students are asked to wear masks on buses. Students should be assigned seats, and a transparent barrier may be used to separate the driver.

ALBERTA

The province is planning to fully reopen schools from kindergarten to Grade 12 this fall. Measures will be tightened if an outbreak occurs and class sizes could be reduced to 20.

Back to class: School will be back in session with extra safety measures, but the province says there are programs to support remote and alternative learning.

Groups: Schools should sort students into cohorts by class when possible to minimize contact with others.

Physical distancing: Physical distancing is recommended when possible. Rooms should be rearranged to increase space between desks.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for staff and many students in some school settings. Students in Grades 4 to 12 must wear masks in all common areas, such as hallways and on buses. Staff are required to wear masks whenever physical distancing cannot be maintained. Mask use will be optional for kids in kindergarten through Grade 3. The government says all students and staff will receive two reusable masks as part of the policy.

Transportation: Parents are asked to bring their children to school if they can. Students who take the bus will sit in the same seat every day.

New routines: Schools are advised to consider a ""no sharing policy,"" with each student bringing their own supplies. Class, lunch and recess schedules will be staggered.

SASKATCHEWAN

Saskatchewan first unveiled a set of back-to-school guidelines in June, but released more details and made some changes in August.

Back to class: Students will return to class on Sept. 8 after the province pushed the date back from as early as Sept. 1

Groups: Groups of students and staff members assigned to them should stick together throughout the day and try not to mingle with other groups. Schools should aim to minimize the number of different instructors who interact with students throughout the day.

Physical distancing: Officials say maintaining physical distance is ""less practical"" for younger children, and the focus should be on limiting physical contact. Officials suggest limiting hugs and hand holding and suggest using alternative greetings such as air high fives. Schools are also to have dedicated quarantine areas where symptomatic students can go before they are picked up by parents.

Masks: The province says it's up to school boards to decide whether to make masks mandatory for students and staff. The chief medical health officer advises Grade 4 to 12 students should wear them in busy areas such as hallways and on buses.

Transportation: Parents should take their kids to school when possible, and pickup and drop-offs should happen outside. Students using school transportation should be assigned seats, and a partition may be used to separate the driver.

New routines: Start times, recess, lunch and class transitions may be staggered to allow for more space for physical distancing. Schools should rearrange their classrooms to space out students. Students and staff are asked to bring hand sanitizer. In school public health visits for routine vaccinations will include COVID-19 testing, with parental consent.

MANITOBA

The Manitoba government says students are going back to the classroom on Sept. 8 with new guidelines.

Back to class: All students from kindergarten to Grade 8 are to have in-class instruction five days a week. High school students will also be in class full time, however, there may be some days of remote learning.

Groups: When physical distancing isn't possible, students will have to be organized into cohorts of no more than 75, and minimize contact with others. In these cases, there must be at least one metre between their desks.

Physical distancing: The province says students are required to maintain a two-metre distance to ""the greatest extent possible."" When it isn't possible, physical barriers may be an option. Spaces should be arranged to encourage separation.

Masks: Masks are strongly recommended for students in Grades 5 to 12. They are required when taking the bus.

Transportation: Masks are required for students Grade 5 and up, as well as drivers, on buses. Parents are encouraged to transport their children to school if they can.

New routines: Lunch and recess are to be staggered to minimize congestion, and in many cases teachers will change classrooms instead of students.

ONTARIO

Ontario students will be back in class September, but their schedules and class sizes may vary depending on where they live.

Back to class: Elementary students and many high schoolers will be in school five days a week in standard class sizes. However, secondary students at two dozen boards that are higher risk will only attend class half the time, and will spend the rest of the week working on ""curriculum-linked independent work."" Parents will also have the option to keep their kids out of class, and boards must provide options for remote learning.

Groups: For high schoolers in high-risk districts, class sizes will be capped at 15. Meanwhile, elementary students won't be broken up into smaller groups, but will be grouped into cohorts and their exposure to different teachers will be limited.

Physical distancing: While Education Minister Stephen Lecce said the aim is to keep students one metre apart from each other, a guidance document says only that schools should promote ""as much distancing as possible"" rather than being strictly enforced.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 through 12, and will be strongly encouraged for younger kids when they're in indoor common areas. Staff will be expected to wear masks.

Transportation: Some school boards may have more than one student assigned to a seat. When physical distancing isn't possible, masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 to 12, and younger students will be encouraged but not required to do the same.

New routines: Students in some districts will have to pre-register for in-person schooling. Some schools may limit or even ban visitors, including parents. Breaks will be scheduled to allow students to wash their hands.

QUEBEC

All elementary and high school students in Quebec will be required to attend class in September unless they have a doctor's note indicating they're at high risk of COVID-19 complications or they live with someone at risk. Those students will be allowed to study remotely.

Back to class: Class attendance is mandatory for elementary and high school students. For Grades 10 and 11, schools have the option of alternating schedules where students attend one day out of every two — as long as schools cannot maintain stable classroom bubbles. Grade 10 and 11 students are encouraged to attend classes as much as possible.

Groups: Each classroom will be its own bubble and students will not be required to maintain a two-metre distance between classmates.

Physical distancing: Students will need to keep a two-metre distance from all school staff, as well as all other students outside their classroom bubble. There are no physical distancing requirements for children or teachers in pre-school.

Masks: All students in Grade 5 and up — as well as all school staff — must wear a mask inside all common areas of the school except the classroom. Masks can also be removed when students are eating.

Transportation: No more than 48 students will be allowed on a school bus, with no more than two students sitting on the same bench. Preschool and elementary school students are strongly encouraged to wear masks, while older students are required to wear them.

New routines: When schools return in the fall, teachers will move from classroom to classroom, but students will stay put.

Backup plans: In the event of an outbreak in one class, the entire classroom bubble will be sent home to continue studies remotely. Authorities are also putting together an emergency protocol in the event of a second wave to ensure instruction continues online if entire schools are again forced to close. Ideas include quickly distributing tablets or laptops to students needing them and establishing a digital platform to continue courses and maintain communication.

NEW BRUNSWICK

The province has outlined a set of requirements schools must follow in developing their plans for the fall.

Back to class: Students in kindergarten to Grade 8 are to attend school full time, while those in Grades 9 to 12 are to be taught using a combination of in-class and remote instruction. At-home course work can include online learning, guided projects and experiential education.

Groups: For kindergarten through Grade 2, group sizes will be reduced to about 15, wherever possible. Group sizes should also be shrunk for Grades 3 to 5. Grades 6 to 8 will resume at regular class sizes. Students in Grades 9 to 12 will not be grouped because of their schedules and course options.

Physical distance: Grade 9 to 12 classrooms are required to maintain a one-metre distance, while a two-metre distance is recommended in common areas at all grade levels.

Masks: All students will be required to bring a mask to school, but masks will not be mandatory inside the classroom. Students in Grade 6-12 must wear masks on the school bus and in common areas of school buildings, while children in kindergarten to Grade 5 are encouraged to do so. Teachers for kindergarten to Grade 8 can choose whether they want to wear a mask or shield in the classroom while teachers for Grades 9-12 will be required to wear one when they cannot physically distance from students.

Transportation: Curtains will be installed inside school buses to separate drivers from students. If physical distancing is not possible, drivers will be required to wear a mask or face shield. Students must sit in the same seat every day. Students in kindergarten to Grade 5 will sit alone or with a member of their household. Students in Grades 6-12 wearing masks will sit two to a seat, and if they are sitting alone or with a member of their household, they do not have to wear a mask.

New routines: Arrivals, breaks and lunches are to be staggered. Public access to school buildings will be limited, and students, staff and visitors may also be subject to screening. High school students will be expected to have their own laptop or similar device, and some subsidies will be available. Drinking fountains will be replaced with water bottle-filling stations.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND

Schools on the Island are preparing to welcome all students back to class, while drafting backup plans for remote studies if required.

Back to class: Schools are to reopen for teachers and staff on Sept. 1 and for students on Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be organized into cohorts when possible and limit their exposure to others.

Physical distancing: Students will be taught about the importance of physical distancing, and extra teaching and cleaning staff may be hired. Schools are also asked to reduce class sizes as much as possible, reconfigure classrooms and make use of spaces such as libraries and multipurpose rooms.

Masks: The province says all staff and students in Grades 7-12 are ""strongly recommended"" to wear masks when physical distancing cannot be maintained. Students from kindergarten through Grade 6 may wear masks when physical distancing is impossible. Staff interacting with children who have complex medical needs are strongly recommended to wear face shields and gloves.

Transportation: Parents are asked to take their kids to school whenever possible. To reduce the number of riders on buses, schools may add vehicles and routes or implement walk-to-school programs. It is strongly recommended that all students and drivers wear masks on the bus.

New routines: P.E.I. education authorities are revising curricula for this school year to make up for learning gaps caused by lockdown constraints. Schools will stagger schedules to minimize congestion. The provincial school food program will be expanded next year in keeping with public health precautions. Elementary school students will stay in their classrooms for lunch.

NOVA SCOTIA

Education Minister Zach Churchill says the province's objective is for schools to return to 100 per cent capacity in the fall, but its plan includes measures to address the possible onset of a second wave of COVID-19.

Back to class: The province aims to have all elementary and high school students in classrooms by Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be asked to keep to cohorts.

Physical distancing: Students and staff will be encouraged to maintain a two-metre distance whenever possible. Lecture rooms will be reorganized to increase space between desks.

Masks: All students in grades 4 to 12 will be required to wear a mask inside schools except when seated at desks that are two metres apart and facing the same direction. Masks must be worn in hallways and other common areas if a two-metre distance cannot be maintained. All students and staff will receive two free cloth masks. Disposable masks will be available if a student loses theirs or comes to school without one.

Transportation: Students who take the school bus will be required to wear non-medical masks.

New routines: Only students and staff will be permitted to enter school buildings. When possible, teachers will be asked to move their classes outdoors. Students will be asked to bring their own computers to school, and the province says it has acquired an additional 14,000 devices for those with limited access to technology. The ventilation systems of each school will be assessed to ensure the equipment is operating properly.

Backup plans: If a COVID-19 outbreak occurs during the academic year, schools will move to a blended learning model with smaller class sizes and home learning for older students.

NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR

The province's back-to-school plan aims to maximize in-class attendance with the option of a return to remote learning if the COVID-19 risk increases.

Back to class: The province's plan outlines three scenarios — in-class instruction, remote learning or a combination of both, depending on the COVID-19 risk in a particular community. The Newfoundland and Labrador English School District said in person classes will resume in September given low case numbers in the province and families can apply to homeschool their children.

Groups: Cohorting by class is recommended when feasible, but students' schedules shouldn't be disrupted to support smaller groupings. In the English School District, high school students will not be grouped by cohorts due to curriculum requirements.

Physical distancing: Schools should aim to create a two-metre distance between desks, or as close to that as possible. The English School District says signage will be placed inside schools reminding people about physical distancing.

Masks: Masks must be worn on school buses and in communal areas of high schools but they are not required inside classrooms. Staff will not be required to wear masks if physical distancing is possible. The province's English School District will provide two masks for each teacher and one for each student.

Transportation: Bus drivers and riders will be required to wear masks. The English School District has said bus ridership will be limited to 46 students per bus and up to 6,000 students may need to make alternate transportation arrangements.

New routines: All students must bring their own supplies in keeping with a ""no sharing"" policy. Students are advised to bring their own water bottles.

Backup plans: In the event of moderate-to-widespread transmission of COVID-19, school districts will move to online learning. Classroom attendance should be limited to about 50 per cent when the COVID-19 risk in a community is considered low to moderate. Newfoundland and Labrador says it will spend $20 million to purchase laptops for teachers and students in Grades 7 through 12 to support remote learning.

YUKON

The territorial government says it's making plans for the next school year that include flexibility around the number of students in classes if there's a second wave of COVID-19 or increased risk of transmission. It says each school will determine how it will adjust its operations to meet those guidelines, and school principals and staff are expected to share that information prior to September.

Back to class: Preliminary plans indicate that in rural communities, all students will return to school full time. In Whitehorse, however, kids in kindergarten through Grade 9 will return to full-day in-school instruction, while Grades 10 to 12 will spend half their day in the classroom, and the rest learning remotely.

Groups: Class sizes may be smaller to meet safety restrictions.

Masks: Wearing masks is a personal choice.

Transportation: Bus school and schedules will be posted to the territory's website.

New routines: Schedule shakeups may mean that some students won't have their regular teacher or the same classmates. School meal programs may be adapted with new safety measures and pickup options.

Backup plans: The territory has outlined a spectrum of school options if the risk to the community increases, ranging from rotating schedules to suspension of face-to-face learning.

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES

All N.W.T. schools have submitted plans to reopen their doors this fall. The territory says education authorities are taking a flexible approach in their planning to account for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall.

Back to class: While plans will vary from school to school, the territory will offer in-person instruction whenever possible, while ensuring alternative options are available.

Groups: Students in kindergarten through Grade 6 will be in classroom ""bubbles,"" and won't have to practise physical distancing within these groups.

Physical distancing: For Grades 7 to 9, students are asked to maintain a one-metre distance from each other, and two-metre distance from staff. Grade 10 to 12 students are asked to allow for two metres of distance from their peers and instructors.

Masks: Students of all ages may be required to wear masks in situations where physical distance cannot be practised, such as moving through the hallways.

Transportation: There may be changes to bus schedules, and all riders will be required to wear masks.

New routines: More time will be spent learning outside. School hours and schedules may also look different. Students are asked to label personal items and not share.

Backup plans: The territory says schools are preparing to shift between in-person, distance and blended learning at short notice should there become active COVID-19 cases.

---

NUNAVUT

The territory has released a four-stage plan for reopening schools based on the risk of the novel coronavirus in a community.

Back to class: There are no reported COVID-19 cases in Nunavut, so all schools are set to reopen this fall with enhanced cleaning and safety precautions.

Groups: It is recommended that schools cohort students by class and limit mixing as much as possible.

Physical distancing: Distance requirements will depend on what stage a community is in, and will primarily be achieved by limiting school attendance.

Masks: In most cases, the use of masks is not recommended for children. If there are exceptions, parents will be notified, and masks will be provided.

Transportation: As it stands, bus schedules are set to resume. Students older than 13 may be required to wear masks.

New routines: Group activities will be limited. Students won't be allowed to share food in lunchrooms.

Backup plans: The territory says schools could go part-time if contact tracing were to identify a possible source of COVID-19. All schools would be closed if community transmission were to take place.

Pandher, who lives near Whitehorse, has been dancing and travelling his way across Vancouver Island over the past week trying to spread a message of positivity during COVID-19.

""(The pandemic) created a lot of pressure and stresses. Some people are sharing it, some people are not, but everybody is feeling it ... I'd like to say be happy, be hopeful, even though it's hard,"" Pandher said in an interview.

He rose to fame with a series of viral videos showcasing his bhangra skills, dancing alongside members of the Canadian Armed Forces, local politicians and first responders.

Bhangra is a lively form of dance to music, originating from the Punjab region in India and characterized by leaps, kicks and arm movement.

""Bhangra has a lot of elements of positivity and happiness, and it's very high-energy,"" Pandher said. ""It's a workout dance, it's a happy dance, it brings people together.""

Pandher has been practising bhangra most of his life, punctuated by small breaks every now and then, but he's recently turned it into a full-time job, teaching it online to help those feeling cooped up due to the pandemic.

""Many professionals, doctors, high commissioners, politicians, they were taking these classes. I was quite touched,"" he said.

Yukon imposed COVID-19 border restrictions when the pandemic first hit, but opened its border to B.C. in July, prompting a vacation idea from Pandher.

""Vancouver Island is kind of like the Yukon. It's known for its wilderness, its natural beauty, the people and also the great thing is that both areas are remote,"" he said, clarifying that while not as remote as Yukon, Vancouver Island still had an ocean separating it from its mainland neighbours.

That separation was part of the reason for the holiday choice, as Pandher believes it helps protect it from COVID-19 outbreaks.

It's not the dance instructor's first visit to the island.

He previously visited the Canadian Armed Forces base in Esquimalt, leading 15 members in a bhangra session.

He said he's been stopped and visited by fans during this most recent trip, with a particular highlight being a visit and dance session with firefighters in Nanaimo and an attempt to surf at Tofino.

""It's just like dancing bhangra,"" Pander said of surfing. ""In bhangra you need to co-ordinate a lot of movements to put it together — same with surfing: balance, co-ordination — and just being on the beach and in the water was awesome.""

Pandher is scheduled to leave B.C. on Sunday but hopes to come back again in the future.

He says it drew a crowd, but officers were able to break it up.

Video of the party was shared on social media, and appeared to show a crowd of people dancing in close quarters.

Chow says groups of people have been congregating around music or buskers outside because there aren't many indoor options available during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The trend has prompted celebrities to respond to a plea from Premier John Horgan for help with messaging to younger residents about partying during the pandemic.

Vancouver-born actor and comedian Seth Rogen tweeted on Saturday that the ""people of British Columbia"" should forego parties, barbecues and other gatherings in favour of more low-key activities.

""It's more fun to hang out alone and smoke weed and watch movies and TV shows anyway!"" he wrote. ""Do that instead!""

British Columbia has seen a rise in cases over the past week, reporting 85, 78 and 84 new cases on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday respectively.

Previously, actor Ryan Reynolds lent his voice to the cause.

On Friday he posted a voice recording on Twitter, framed as a voicemail left for Horgan, warning B.C.'s younger residents of the dangers of COVID-19.

""Young folks in B.C., they're partying, which is of course dangerous,"" he said in the recording. ""They probably don't know that thousands of young people aren't just getting sick of coronavirus, they're dying of it too.""

He urged them not to kill some of B.C.'s coolest residents — including David Suzuki and Reynold's mom.

""Let's not kill anyone,"" he said. ""I think that's reasonable.""

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said Thursday that people between the ages of 20 and 29 now make up the group seeing the largest increase of infections.

As of Friday, 4,358 people in British Columbia had tested positive for the virus, the majority of whom have recovered. Public health officials have recorded 196 deaths linked to the virus.

In a Tweet sent out around noon Saturday, Aug. 15, the Vancouver funnyman answered premier John Horgan’s call for celebrities to help get the message out to younger residents who have increasingly contributed to the province’s COVID-19 active caseload.

Rogen joins fellow Vancouverite turned Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds in encouraging young British Columbians to stop partying amid the pandemic.

Reynolds, star and producer of the Deadpool franchise, responded to Horgan's plea in a Tweet Friday, stating, ""I got your message about the thing. Look, I'm not sure it's a great idea, frankly. People don't want medical advice from guys like me.""

Following his joke, Reynolds underscored that many young people may not realize how many young people are getting sick from COVID-19 and that many of them are dying.

Reynolds continued to inject levity into the serious message by saying that his mom would also like to be out having fun on Kitsilano Beach, and that he hoped that young people in the province would keep both her and Canadian icon David Suzuki safe during the health crisis.

""I hope that young people in B.C. don't kill my mom, frankly, or David Suzuki,"" said Reynolds.

With active COVID-19 cases at their highest in three months, earlier this week Horgan hinted at a carrot and stick approach to British Columbians — and especially younger people — to heed health and safety guidelines.

Provincial health officials announced 85 new cases Wednesday, Aug. 12, the highest one-day total for the province since late April. By Friday, B.C. had recorded its highest three-day total since the pandemic began.

This week, Horgan said if private house parties continue to contribute to the growing caseload in the province, enforcement will follow suit, with warnings escalating into more severe penalties.

A string of public exposure alerts has been issued recently for private parties, bars, restaurants, night clubs and stores across the Lower Mainland. Health officials also continue to flag flights through Vancouver for exposure to the virus.

Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a joint statement Friday that several bars, restaurants and nightclubs in the Vancouver Coastal Health region have been closed following transmission events, “some by public health order and others voluntarily.”

More than 70 new cases have been reported in B.C. over each of the past three days. On Friday, B.C.’s new cases totalled 84, and total active cases numbered 629.

Since late June, the majority of new cases have been driven by young people, particularly the 20 to 29 age group, as well as people in their 30s.

Henry has also cautioned that young people aren’t immune to long-lasting effects of COVID-19 – such as extreme fatigue and breathing difficulties – even if they were never hospitalized and their illness was relatively mild.

Meanwhile, the latest modelling by B.C.’s health agency, presented Thursday, suggests that the number of COVID-19 cases could soar to levels higher than was seen in April.

If the current rate of social contacts – which is sitting at 70 per cent of pre-pandemic levels – continues, B.C. could see over 100 cases a day by September. The province has recommended people keep their contacts to 60 per cent or lower in order to avoid a surge in cases.

However, Henry has noted that models aren’t firm predictions – rather, they suggest what can happen.

Henry and Dix urged British Columbians Friday to “stay strong and hold the line” this weekend.

“We have it within our ability to make the changes we need to bend our pandemic curve back down and continue in our B.C. restart, but it takes the combined efforts of everyone, not just a few.”

Earlier this week, the province announced it would be hiring 500 more contact tracers in preparation for a potential surge of the virus in the fall. The contact tracers should be in place by September."

But while Nguessan Bi kept working, he said he found out Friday that he would be excluded from a new government program to fast-track the permanent residency applications of some asylum seekers working on the front lines during the pandemic.

""Why (not) us? We who gave our hearts and our love... Why are we abandoned?"" he said in an interview at a protest camp across the street from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Montreal riding office Saturday. ""What did we do to deserve this?""

Ottawa announced Friday that asylum seekers working in specific jobs in the health-care sector would be eligible for permanent residency without first having to wait for their asylum claims to be accepted, as is typically the process.

Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino said the move came in response to public demand for so-called ""Guardian Angels"" — many in Quebec — to be recognized for their work.

""They demonstrated a uniquely Canadian quality in that they were looking out for others and so that is why is today is so special,"" Mendicino said in an interview Friday afternoon.

But asylum seekers and their supporters say Ottawa's plan excludes thousands of workers without permanent status in Canada who have laboured on the front lines during the pandemic, often at great personal risk to themselves and their families.

That includes security guards and janitorial staff, factory workers, and farm labourers, among others.

""I have friends who worked with me in security that abandoned (their posts) because they were afraid of getting infected. But I stayed,"" said Nguessan Bi.

He said he wants Trudeau and Quebec Premier Francois Legault to do something to help asylum seekers who are not eligible for the new program.

Several dozen people rallied in front of Trudeau's office on Saturday to demand permanent residency for all asylum seekers.

""It's an act of recognition. They deserve status,"" Joseph Clormeus, a member of Debout pour la dignite, a Montreal advocacy group that organized the rally, told the crowd.

Anite Presume, a Haitian asylum seeker who came to Quebec in August 2017 from the United States, was among the protesters.

She works in a medication factory, and said she kept working during the pandemic despite the risks.

""To take the bus, we were all stressed, but we still went to work because it was essential. They needed medication for the hospitals,"" she said in an interview.

She said she has not received a response yet to her application for asylum in Canada, and lives under a cloud of uncertainty and stress about her future.

""It's a feeling of rejection,"" Presume said, about not being included in Ottawa's regularization program. ""They rejected us as if we did nothing.""

To apply for residency under the new program, applicants must have claimed asylum in Canada prior to March 13 and have spent no less than 120 hours working as an orderly, nurse or another designated occupation between the date of their claim and Aug. 14.

They must also demonstrate they have six months of experience in the profession before they can receive permanent residency and have until the end of August 2021 to meet that requirement.

The program was the result of negotiations between the federal government and Quebec, who have had a strained relationship on the question of immigration, and in particular the asylum claimants, in recent years.

Public support has been building for asylum seekers' demand for permanent residency after it was revealed that refugee claimants were among those toiling in Quebec's long-term care facilities, which were hard-hit by COVID-19.

Think you might have symptoms? Take a self-assessment

On this page

Symptoms of COVID-19

Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from person to person. Symptoms may also vary in different age groups. Some of the more commonly reported symptoms include:

new or worsening cough

shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

temperature equal to or over 38°C

feeling feverish

chills

fatigue or weakness

muscle or body aches

new loss of smell or taste

headache

gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting)

feeling very unwell



Children have been more commonly reported to have abdominal symptoms, and skin changes or rashes.

In severe cases, infection can lead to death.

Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19.

Evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to others from someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes people who:

have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic)

never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)

While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening among those in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to what extent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.

If you or your child become ill

If you are showing symptoms of COVID-19, reduce your contact with others:

isolate yourself at home for 14 days to avoid spreading it to others if you live with others, stay in a separate room or keep a 2-metre distance

visit a health care professional or call your local public health authority for information on getting tested call ahead to tell them your symptoms and follow their instructions



Children who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without needing hospitalization. If you are caring for a child who has suspected or probable COVID-19, it is important to follow the advice for caregivers. This advice will help you protect yourself, others in your home, as well as others in the community.

If you become sick while travelling back to Canada:

inform the flight attendant or a Canadian border services officer

advise a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada if you believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, even if you do not have symptoms this is required under the Quarantine Act the Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow



Check if you have been exposed

Have you been on a recent flight, cruise or train? Check the listed exposure locations to see if you may have been exposed to COVID-19.

You can also join the effort to limit the spread of COVID-19 with Canada's free COVID Alert app. It notifies you if someone you were near in the past 14 days tells the app they tested positive. Download COVID Alert.

Take care of your mental health

The COVID-19 pandemic is new and unexpected. This situation can be unsettling and can cause a sense of loss of control. It is normal to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared or worried in a crisis. Make sure to care for your mental and physical wellbeing and to ask for help if you feel overwhelmed.

Getting tested

Since the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 can be absent, mild, severe or can look like the flu or other illnesses, the only way to confirm you have COVID-19 is through a laboratory test.

For information about COVID-19 testing in your area, contact your local public health authority.

If you have tested positive

If you've been tested for coronavirus and receive a positive test result, you must isolate at home, whether you have symptoms or not.

If you have symptoms (symptomatic), you must

isolate at home (as soon as your symptoms start), and remain isolated for 14 days or as directed by your public health authority

If you do not have symptoms (asymptomatic) you must:

isolate at home as soon as you receive the confirmed laboratory test, and remain isolated for 14 days or as directed by your public health authority

as directed by your public health authority if you did not have symptoms when you got tested, but then develop symptoms during your 14-day isolation period, you must restart your isolation time

Refer to your public health authority to find out how many days you should remain in isolation.

Treating coronavirus

Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own.

If you are concerned about your symptoms, you should self-monitor and consult your health care provider. They may recommend steps you can take to relieve symptoms.

Vaccine, therapeutics and medical devices

We do not yet have a vaccine to prevent COVID-19, but research and development are underway. Health Canada has introduced innovative and agile regulatory measures that will speed up the review of COVID-19 health products while still meeting standards for:

safety

quality

efficacy

Flu vaccine

If you have received a flu vaccine, it will not protect against coronaviruses, but will help prevent the flu. Getting the flu could make you more vulnerable to other infections.

Getting the flu vaccine will not increase your risk of illness from coronavirus. For more information, please refer to this recently published Canadian research study.

About coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people and others cause illness in animals. Human coronaviruses are common and are typically associated with mild illnesses, similar to the common cold.

COVID-19 is a new disease that has not been previously identified in humans. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people, and more rarely, these can then spread from person to person through close contact.

There have been 2 other specific coronaviruses that have spread from animals to humans and which have caused severe illness in humans. These are the:"

Wearing masks Medical masks are recommended for COVID-19 patients in the home and for protection for those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home.
A non-medical mask or face covering may also be worn by those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home.","If you are caring for a person who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, follow this advice to protect yourself and others in the home, as well as those in your community.

Limit contact

Only one healthy person should provide care.

Do not share personal items with the ill person, such as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic devices.

Use a separate bathroom from the ill person, if possible. If not possible, the ill person should put the toilet lid down before flushing.

Some people may transmit COVID-19 even though they do not show any symptoms. Wearing a mask, including a non-medical mask or face covering (i.e. made with at least two layers of tightly woven fabric, constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can help protect others around you.

Prevent contact with animals, as there have been several reports of people transmitting COVID-19 to their pets.

Protect yourself

If possible, people who are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19 should not care for someone with COVID-19. These people include elderly persons, those with chronic medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes) or compromised immune systems.

If you need to be within 2 metres of the ill person, wear personal protective equipment: a medical mask disposable gloves eye protection

Wear disposable gloves when touching the ill person, their environment and soiled items or surfaces.

Avoid re-using medical masks or gloves.

Clean your hands often for at least 20 seconds, especially after contact with the ill person and after removing gloves, face masks and eye protection.

Dry your hands with disposable paper towels. If not available, use a reusable towel and replace it when it becomes wet.

You can also remove dirt with a wet wipe and then use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Wearing masks Medical masks are recommended for COVID-19 patients in the home and for protection for those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home.

N95 respirators must be reserved for healthcare workers and should not be used for caregiving at home.

If medical masks are not available, non-medical masks or face coverings (i.e. constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can be worn by the ill person, if tolerable. This will cover their mouth and nose, and may prevent respiratory droplets from contaminating others or landing on surfaces.

A non-medical mask or face covering may also be worn by those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home. However, wearing a non-medical mask or facial covering in the community has not been proven to protect the person wearing it.

Strict hygiene and public health measures, including frequent hand washing and maintaining a physical distance of at least 2 metres from the ill person, will reduce the chance of being exposed to the virus.

Non-medical cloth masks should be carefully removed when soiled or damp, laundered in hot water and then dried thoroughly.

Hands must be cleaned before and after putting on and removing a mask.

Keep your environment clean

Place used medical masks, gloves and other contaminated items in a lined container, secure the contents and dispose of them with other household waste.

Place possibly contaminated laundry, including non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings, into a container with a plastic liner and do not shake. Wash with regular laundry soap and hot water (60-90°C), and dry well. Clothing, linens and non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings belonging to the ill person can be washed with other laundry.

At least once daily, clean and disinfect surfaces that people touch often, such as toilets, laundry containers, bedside tables, doorknobs, phones and television remotes.

Use only approved hard-surface disinfectants that have a Drug Identification Number (DIN). A DIN is an 8-digit number given by Health Canada that confirms the disinfectant product is approved and safe for use in Canada.

When approved hard surface disinfectants are not available, for household disinfection, a diluted bleach solution can be prepared in accordance with the instructions on the label, or in a ratio of 5 millilitres (mL) of bleach per 250 mL of water OR 20 mL of bleach per litre of water. This ratio is based on bleach containing 5% sodium hypochlorite, to give a 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution. Follow instructions for proper handling of household (chlorine) bleach.

If they can withstand the use of liquids for disinfection, high-touch electronic devices (e.g. keyboards, tablets, smartboards) may be disinfected with 70% alcohol (e.g. alcohol prep wipes) at least daily.

Monitor yourself for symptoms

If you have always used the recommended precautions, then monitor yourself for symptoms for 14 days following your last close contact with the ill person.

Quarantine (self-isolate) at home for 14 days from your last exposure and contact your local public health authority if you have no symptoms but: cared for a person who has COVID-19 without the recommended personal protective equipment live with or had close physical contact (e.g. intimate partner) without using the recommended personal protective equipment live with or have had regular close contact (within 2 metres) with a person who has COVID-19 up to 48 hours prior to symptom onset or while they were symptomatic and not isolating had direct contact with the body fluids of a person who has COVID-19 (e.g. were coughed or sneezed on) without the recommended personal protective equipment



If you start to develop symptoms, isolate yourself as quickly as possible and contact your local public health authority for further instructions.

Maintain these supplies

Medical masks if available, or non-medical mask or face covering

Eye protection (face shield or goggles) for use by caregiver

Disposable gloves (do not re-use) for use by caregiver

Disposable paper towels

Tissues

Waste container with plastic liner

At yesterday's Ministry of Health briefing, Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, reported 269 new cases of COVID-19 in British Columbia over three 24-hour reporting periods:

Aug. 21 to 22: 109 new cases.

Aug. 22 to 23: 81 new cases

Aug. 23-24: 79 new cases.

There have been 5,184 cases since the pandemic began; of those, 1,651 cases have been in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. There are 913 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, 2,594 people who are under active public health monitoring as a result of identified exposure to known cases, and 4,068 people who tested positive have recovered. Currently, 18 people are hospitalized in B.C. with COVID-19, five of whom are in intensive care. In total, nine long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility have active outbreaks. There continue to be community exposure events, including in Vancouver Coastal Health, and on flights into and out of British Columbia. Check the Vancouver Coastal Health Public Exposures page for the locations and times of known possible exposures to COVID-19 to the public in our region.



Finding the balance

Dr. Henry said our goals are clear as we live with COVID-19 in our communities: to prevent cases through our personal safety measures, detect new cases as quickly as possible and respond just as quickly to contain the spread of the virus. Public health teams continue to closely watch our key indicators to ensure we are staying where we need to be. This includes monitoring the level of community spread, as well as the percentage of positive tests. In both cases, right now we are staying within the range of where we need to be. We still have low transmission and we want to keep it that way as our summer continues and we look to the fall. It is about finding the balance – protecting vulnerable people and keeping our activities going. Our COVID-19 response in B.C. is about all of us doing our part and taking the right precautions based on our circumstances. It is about protecting those around us and protecting ourselves. While there are a few that have disregarded public health measures, new enforcement rules are in place to shore up the gaps that have emerged. This is how we will get through this storm together – supporting each other, adjusting our approach as we learn more about the virus and tailoring our activities to the circumstances before us. Let's stay strong and continue to use the basic steps to live safely while COVID-19 is still a part of our lives.



Return to sport

Also yesterday, Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture, announced the Province is moving to Phase 3 of the Return to Sport Guidelines. The BC Centre for Disease Control has reviewed viaSport's Return to Sport Guidelines for Phase 3. The guidelines contain recommendations for how different types of sports now can progressively add activities back again while continuing to adhere to current public health recommendations. This new guidance addresses contact activities, cohorts, competitions, high-performance training environments and travel. Under Phase 3 of the Return to Sport Guidelines, amateur sport activities may be able to engage in:

additional training opportunities;

modified games and matches; and

league play and competitions within sport cohorts.

In June 2020, viaSport released its Return to Sport Guidelines to support the amateur sport sector through the careful and gradual restarting of sports in B.C. communities. With Phase 3, each provincial sport organization can use the overarching guidelines to develop or revise its sport-specific plans. To date, 60 organizations have completed their return to play plans.



Canada announces funding for Indigenous mental wellness support

Earlier today, the federal Minister of Indigenous Services, Marc Miller, announced $82.5 million in mental health and wellness supports to help Indigenous communities adapt and expand mental wellness services, improving access and addressing growing demand, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Culturally appropriate and timely mental health supports are critical to promote the well-being for anyone struggling to cope with the added stress and anxiety caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Indigenous-led, community-driven supports that offer a more holistic approach to mental wellness are necessary to respond to the needs of youth, families and elders. Prior to the pandemic, demand for counselling and mental wellness support was already trending upward. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the need for mental health support, innovative solutions are particularly needed now. The funding announced today responds to the advocacy of many Indigenous leaders who have pushed for enhanced mental supports. This funding will support the Government of Canada's work with First Nations, Inuit and Métis partners and communities in distinctions-based envelopes. The funding will help partners and communities to adapt mental wellness services to the current COVID-19 context, including:

expanding access to culturally appropriate services such as on the land activities, community-based health supports and mental wellness teams;

adapting mental health services, such as virtual counselling, to meet increased demand; and

supporting Indigenous partners in developing innovative strategies to address substance use and to improve access to treatment services.



Testing

Anyone in the VCH region with cold, influenza or COVID-19-like symptoms, however mild, can now be assessed for and get a COVID-19 test. Contact your physician or nurse practitioner's office, or a local community collection centre to arrange for a test. Phone numbers and locations of collection centre can be found by visiting: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testing or by calling 8-1-1. In Vancouver, the City Centre and REACH urgent and primary care centres can provide testing as well as the St. Vincent's drive-up location at 4875 Heather Street. The Richmond Assessment Centre is located at 6820 Gilbert Road, in the parking lot of the Richmond Tennis Club. On the North Shore, testing is available at the North Vancouver Urgent and Primary Care Centre. If you think you need testing, please call ahead before visiting your doctor, urgent and primary care center or health clinic.



VCH Medical Health Officers, our provincial partners and the Public Health Agency of Canada continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic. To protect yourself while out in public, wash your hands frequently and maintain social distance. For more information on COVID-19, please visit www.vch.ca/COVID19.

That has led to some interesting discoveries.

For example, the most surprising book dropped off was a Russian chiropractic manual in Cyrillic script. It’s also the only book that hasn’t been picked up by someone — but that’s only because it didn’t get a chance. It was shredded one night, with the pieces left in Threlfall’s backyard.

“I guess somebody didn’t like the Russian chiropractic manual,” he said.

When he set up the Fernwood Re-Public Library, Threlfall said knew he wanted to compile statistics about which books came and went.

“What kind of books get placed in little free libraries? Who puts them there? From where? How often? Which authors? Questions were many; the answers lay in our library,” he wrote in an online post for the Greater Victoria Placemaking Network.

Threlfall said he assumed it was going to be mostly romance novels, thrillers and “crappy books that nobody wants to read” in the library, which operates on the principle of “leave a book, take a book.”

He was surprised by the quality, variety and the age of the books dropped off, including original publications from the 1920s and 1930s as well as reprints of classic novels, like Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations.

“I don’t think we have yet to receive a romance novel at all,” he said. “And seeing what comes through is pretty fantastic.”

For four months, Threlfall has tracked the comings and goings each morning and evening from the repurposed bedside table. He logs the title, author, genre, dates in and out, whether the public or his family places the book and whether it’s a paperback or hard cover.

Threlfall has also logged some non-book items that have shown up in the library, including a drill bit set, two loaves of bread, three VHS tapes, four squirt guns, five street maps, a pair of prescription glasses and a single Christmas ornament.

He thought the VHS tapes especially would take a while to move, but a 1980 Bruce Lee film called Fist of Fear, Touch of Death, was gone within two days.

“How many people even have a VHS player anymore?”

Some books are only in the library for a matter of minutes, taken almost as soon as he places them. His family has left 266 books and the public has left 395.

In 15 weeks, he’s found fiction outweighs nonfiction (535 to 126), paperbacks exceed hardcovers (520 to 141), and works by women trump those by men (430 to 204).

Mystery books have been most popular, followed by children’s books, literary fiction, thrillers, historical fiction and young adult novels.

A couple of authors, Camilla Lackberg and Ian Rankin, have appeared at least ten times.

A biography of hockey player and coach Pat Quinn spent the longest stint in the library, waiting 32 days to be checked out.

Threlfall, a writer and former journalist, created a diverse summer reading list for himself out of books he found in the library, which inspired him to branch out of his usual non-fiction choices.

As a self-described “word nerd” with a house full of books, Threlfall said having people deliver books to the library just outside his home is fabulous and tracking the details has been a fun social experiment.

“It’s just been a source of constant amusement and fascination,” he said.

The Greater Victoria Placemaking Network has created a map identifying the locations of the more than 300 little free libraries in Greater Victoria.

“As a father he was supportive and intensely proud of my every endeavor,” said Roden Clark. “My parents divorced when I was very young but he made sure that what time I had with him as a child was full of love, laughs and lessons. “

Father and son remained close into adulthood and Clark was able to pass on “the deeper and more meaningful lessons he had learned throughout his life.”

In Victoria, he worked for 15 years as a daycare educator. He was also a children’s entertainer.

In a Times Colonist profile by Jim and Nic Hume, Clark explained his work with children: “They loved stories, and I loved telling them. And I found they really loved stories when I put a bit of acting in — and I loved the telling and the acting.”

Chivonne Graff met Clark in a workshop on “circle time” for early educators. Clark came with a suitcase filled with props.

“I was inspired to put aside my self-consciousness and tap into my playful, child-like side when engaging with children in groups at circle time,” said Graff. “He was one of two outstanding male educators that I have known in 25 years in the field. He had a special presence in this community.”

Throughout the years, Clark acted in local stage and film productions and was an improv coach. He was infected with the acting bug in Grade 6, after playing the lead in a school play.

At age 36, the fan of Charlie Chaplin embarked on becoming an independent entertainer by creating his first living statues with his best-known act evolving into Plasterman.

Clark started out as “that statue guy” wearing white clothes from Value Village, make-up, a white sheet covering a milkcrate to stand on, and a sign reading “Totally Plastered in Victoria.”

That evolved into a character bathed head to toe in thick white fabric paint, resembling plaster, standing motionless on a wooden block. His bald head and shaved eyebrows (which he did for the busking season) added to his stark image.

Standing out in the summer sun all day seemed an odd choice for a man allergic to the sun.

Nevertheless, since 2000, each May to mid-October, he practised his art.

“He loved his work as a human statue,” said Roden Clark. “The happiness and entertainment it brought people meant the world to him.”

Musician Dave Harris, who has busked on the streets of Victoria for 44 years and now plays on Government Street, met Clark about 20 years ago and described him as “very easy to deal with, friendly, warm and kind.”

“He became one of the most loved and busiest buskers; he worked very hard, often six to eight hours a day in the hot sun,” said Harris.

Some would nearly pass Plasterman only to get a scare upon realizing he was human. He might make a sudden move to silence the cheeky youth, maybe a wink or a grin to the curious.

If tourists wanted a photo he would come to life, for a moment, with a smile or a handshake or a hug for a child. He posed with hundreds of people each day. He graciously acknowledged tips. He said in an interview he made enough money to meet his needs.

“Fun story about Plasterman,” said Harris. “I’m playing in one spot, he’s down the way. A woman with her young son come by. She says, ‘Put the coin in the case. He says, ‘I want to give it to Plasterman.’ I laughed so hard.”

Olympic marathoner and coach Bruce Deacon first met Clark in the non-denominational New Life Community Fellowship church with his then young family. Over the years the two kept in touch.

Plasterman was a constant figure in Victoria and that’s why it’s so hard to imagine him gone, said Deacon.

When the City of Victoria began having buskers audition for a prime rotation of spots, Clark and other veterans were grandfathered in.

“He had a way of touching people’s hearts,” said Deacon, noting his comedic timing and his ability to read people were key. “He knew when he should break from his Plasterman pose to give someone a hug or when to show compassion or when to do something funny or silly with someone,” said Deacon. “He was just brilliant that way.”

Clark said he easily adapted to the stillness — he once timed himself at 45 minutes without moving with the exception of a blink — but it took him years to master how to read and respond, or not, to the audience.

Clark, born to Velma (nee Young) and William Clark, leaves behind his son Daniel, mother Velma, sister Brenda, and brothers Allan and Roger. His father died in 2016 at age 92, in Victoria.

The mother of a Sooke teenager was first angry, then scared, when her 15-year-old son called to say he was on the way to the Royal Jubilee Hospital after being poked by a needle in Rutledge Park.

“I was like ‘What’s happening?’ There are so many people getting hurt by these needles,” said Jayna Forgie, who wrote about what happened in posting to Facebook.

“It’s just scary. My concern is that he would contract something that could be serious. My other concern is that other people are in the park, too. I thought people should be aware. Our kids grew up in that area and played there all the time. I want people to know, if you go out, this happens.”

Her son had been sitting on the grass with a friend, she said. When he went to lie down, the needle poked him in the back.

The needle wasn’t placed to intentionally hurt anyone, it was just discarded, said Forgie.

“It’s a pretty decent neighbourhood so I was pretty surprised. The needle was probably missed in their cleaning routine.”

Her son was examined at the hospital and had a baseline blood test. He will have to have another blood test in three weeks to see if there are any changes.

‘Thank God, it wasn’t a deep puncture,” she said.

Saanich police Const. Markus Anastasiades said police were not notified of the call at the time.

""We are very concerned to hear that this happened and hope that the young man is not facing any serious injuries or health concerns as a result,"" he said.

""Our officers do conduct Park Patrols on a daily basis to ensure compliance with overnight campers. Until this incident, we have not had any recent files involving needles found in parks.""

On Tuesday, Victoria police warned people about an uncapped needle which had been taped to a bench in Centennial Square in a way that would have harmed anyone who sat down.

The uncapped needed was found by a City of Victoria staff member around 10:50 a.m.

On Saturday night, Victoria police issued a warning after a man was pricked by an uncapped needle in Beacon Hill Park. The man told police he was walking on the chip trail in Beacon Hill Park, near Douglas Street and Avalon Road, when he stepped off the path and felt a pain in his foot.

Police don’t know if anyone was injured by the uncapped needle taped to the bench in Centennial Square. They are continuing to investigate. Anyone with information is asked to call the non-emergency line at 250 995-7654 and press 1 for the report desk. To report what you know anonymously, call Greater Victoria Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.

City staff try to safely collect needles on city property and routinely empty drop boxes for sharps when they collect garbage, said spokesman Bill Eisenhauer. A number of groups, including the Downtown Victoria Business Association Clean Team, Aids Vancouver Island Mobile Harm Reduction Unit, SOLID and others pick up used sharps and have programs to educate and encourage the safe disposal of needles. The city also works with Island Health, AVI and other community organizations on harm reduction initiatives and encourages the safe disposal of used syringes, said Eisenhauer.

City staff, who are trained to sweep for hazards in their work areas, are provided with personal protective equipment to safely dispose of any discarded needles they may come across.There are 29 safe disposal boxes in Victoria which are checked multiple times a week and emptied as needed. Boxes in high-use areas are emptied more frequently.

“The boxes are strategically located in various places across the city to support the safe disposal of sharps by the public. We have recently added additional boxes in Centennial Square, Central Park and Beacon Hill Park,” said Eisenhauer.

The DVBA clean team looks after private property in the downtown business area.

“As the opioid crisis continues, I understand data from multiple agencies indicates that there has been an increase in the number of unsafely discarded needles over the last few years,” he said.

The 1/8th label refers to the fact that students tend to take eight courses throughout the school year..

“Not only does the 1/8th model drastically reduce the number of people in a cohort, it also reduces the number of people in school at any given time, thereby limiting the number of people on common spaces,” district superintendent Scott Stinson said in a statement.

Outside of that one class in the morning or afternoon “students will have the remainder of the day for self-directed learning, either at home or on-site where they can receive additional support or access resources,” he said.

Face coverings will be required in high-traffic areas such as hallways and buses.

Schedules will be in place for five weeks at a time.

B.C. school districts are required to give details on their back-to-school plans to the Education Ministry by today.

At the elementary and middle school level, students will return to full-time classes in their own classroom groupings, although two classes can join together to create “learning groups” of up to 60 people. Learning groups will have recess and lunch together, and possibly physical education.

Learning groups at the secondary level can be up to 120 people.

For elementary school, there will be regular school hours and 100 per cent in-class instruction, with staggered start and dismissal times. Face coverings will be optional.

Middle school will also have regular school hours and 100 per cent in-class instruction, with face coverings required in the same way as secondary schools.

The district will be prepared to accommodate students and staff wanting in-class learning.

Cendra Beaton, president of the Sooke Parents’ Education Advisory Council, said parents are asking for more flexibility in the return to school.

“There are absolutely parents that feel it’s a must to send their kids back, there’s parents that are on the fence and there’s parents that don’t feel that it’s safe, given their family circumstances, to send their children back.”

Some parents would like to some sort “hybrid” system, like an “online hub” where teachers are in place to work with students online, Beaton said. She said the month-long return to classes in June featured a hybrid system that worked well.

Sooke School Board chairman Ravi Parmar said that health, safety and student choice are at the foundation of the district’s approach.

“We knew staff and families had questions, so we wanted to implement measures that would build confidence and meet the strong guidelines set by Dr. [Bonnie] Henry and the provincial health office.”

Other steps being taken include:Increased cleaning and disinfectingDesignated entrances and floor markings/signage to control traffic flow.Isolated rooms in case someone falls ill at school.

Alerts about several other potential exposures have been posted recently.

On Tuesday, B.C. Ferries said one of their employee tested positive for COVID-19. Public health officials completed contract tracing with anyone who possibly came in contact with the employee and determined that there were no re-transmissions to other employees or members of the public, said B.C. Ferries spokeswoman Deborah Marshall. Marshall did not disclose where the employee worked or on which route.

Graeme Johnston, president of the B.C. Ferry and Marine Workers’ Union, said in a statement that the union is aware of the potential COVID-19 exposure aboard B.C. Ferries.

“B.C. Ferries and the health authority are working to ensure any possible exposure is traced and isolated,” he said. “We will be keeping close watch on this matter, and wish any involved swift and complete recovery.”

In March, at least one B.C. Ferries employee tested positive for the virus.

As of Monday, masks were required for passengers and staff at all B.C. Ferries terminals and aboard all vessels. Passengers don’t have to wear masks if they are in a vehicle or when they are consuming food or drinks, as long as they are two metres away from others. The rule does not apply to children younger than two, people with underlying medical conditions or a disability that prohibits mask wearing, and people unable to remove their mask without assistance.

B.C. Ferries has also implemented additional cleaning between sailings, screens passengers at ticket booths and requires physical distancing in terminals and on board vessels.

Several Greater Victoria businesses have closed temporarily in the past two weeks after employees tested positive for COVID-19. Between Friday and Saturday, B.C. recorded its highest number of one-day COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic, with 109 people testing positive.

On Tuesday, Island Health issued alerts about two businesses in Sidney after staff members tested positive for COVID-19: Mary’s Bleue Moon Cafe, and 10 Acres Cafe & Market.

On its Facebook page, Mary’s Bleue Moon Cafe, located at 9535 Canora Rd., said it was closed Tuesday and had scheduled “deep cleaning and disinfecting.” Anyone who was at the restaurant on Aug. 21 between 4 and 9:15 p.m. or on Aug. 22 between 9:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. or 5 and 10 p.m. is asked to monitor themselves for symptoms.

The infected 10 Acres staff member worked Aug. 20 and 21 from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Management said on the restaurant’s Facebook page that there is no crossover between the Sidney location, which is at 9805 Seaport Pl., and the restaurant’s downtown locations, The Commons & 10 Acres Bistro. The cafe and 10 Acres at The Pier restaurant will be closed until at least Wednesday for sanitization.

The risk of exposure is low but anyone at these locations at the specified times is asked to monitor for symptoms. Symptoms may include: fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, runny nose, loss of taste or smell, headache, fatigue, diarrhea, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, and muscle aches. There is no need to self-isolate unless you develop symptoms.

There is no known risk to anyone who visited the cafes outside the specified dates and times.

Twist Salon, located at the Bear Mountain Resort in Langford, also shut its doors after one of its stylists tested positive for COVID-19, after being in close contact with another person with the virus. According to a social media post, the salon will be closed until the second week of September as a precautionary measure.

On Friday, Chatters Salon Victoria Westshore announced it would be closing over the weekend after a stylist tested positive for COVID-19. The salon said the stylist hadn’t worked since Aug. 17 and that anyone potentially exposed would be contacted by the health authority.

Milestones Grill and Bar in the Inner Harbour has closed for a deep clean after an employee tested positive on Aug. 20. The restaurant plans to reopen on Aug. 30.

On Aug. 14, 7-Eleven on Douglas Street closed its doors after an employee tested positive for the virus. The company asked anyone who visited the store between Aug. 10 and Aug. 14 to call the provincial COVID-19 health line at 811. The store reopened on Aug. 17.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said public health teams are tracing and identifying close contacts of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and providing clear direction on what to do. Advisories are posted by health authorities only when contact tracers can’t find everyone possible exposed to a person with COVID-19.

The province had its highest-ever overdose fatalities in June, with 177 deaths due to extreme concentrations of illicit fentanyl in street drugs after border closures stopped the flow of substances typically trafficked in the province.

article continues below

The coroners service said Tuesday the death toll in July represents a 136 per cent increase over the 74 deaths during the same month last year.

Provincewide, there were 909 drug deaths in the first seven months of the year. That included 84 in Victoria, compared with 61 in all of last year. Victoria saw 17 deaths in July, up from 16 in June but down from 22 in May. Nanaimo has recorded 24 deaths this year, compared with a total of 27 in 2019.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry joined chief coroner Lisa Lapointe in calling for a robust response to the overdose crisis, saying it’s discouraging that pandemic-related measures such as physical distancing have contributed to overdose fatalities as people use drugs alone.

“I implore anybody who’s using drugs right now, do not do it alone. You need to have your lifeguard there,” Henry said, referring to the presence of someone with the overdose-reversing medication naloxone.

Henry said street drugs are increasingly being cut with substances such as benzodiazepines, non-opioids often prescribed for anxiety, which makes reversal of an overdose with naloxone more difficult.

The onus is on both the provincial and federal governments to act swiftly in addressing the overdose crisis, Henry said.

“It’s not been recognized as the public health emergency that it is across the country,” she said, adding there’s a misconception that prescription opioids are causing overdoses.

Henry has called for the decriminalization of small amounts of drugs for personal use. Last week, Canada’s chief medical health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, made the same suggestion, saying it’s one step that could be taken to help address a recent spike in fatal overdoses in B.C., Alberta and Ontario.

A temporary federal exemption of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act in response to the pandemic led to new provincial guidelines allowing doctors to prescribe substitute medications, including hydromorphone, for users of opioids.

However, the exemptions will expire at the end of September.

Leslie McBain, spokeswoman for Moms Stop the Harm, said that group, along with others including the BC/Yukon Association of Drug War Survivors and the B.C. Association of People on Opioid Maintenance, have stopped attending government-convened committees after several years of participation due to an inadequate response from the province.

McBain, whose 25-year-old son, Jordan Miller, died of an overdose in February 2014, said the groups wrote to Premier John Horgan on Aug. 14 but have not received a response.

Horgan was not immediately available for comment, but Mental Health Minister Judy Darcy said in a statement that the impacts of the toxic drug supply are being felt across Canada.

Toronto recorded 27 overdose deaths in July, a record for that city; 41 people died in Vancouver that month, followed by 53 in June as British Columbia is disproportionately affected by the crisis.

McBain said the advocacy groups were brought together by B.C.’s Overdose Emergency Response Centre many times.

“What we have found over this time is that the advice or the wisdom that we have as people with lived and living experience was never included in the policies, so we felt really tokenized,” she said.

“So we decided to step away until we get meetings with the higher-level ministers and the premier so we can really see where we’re at with our advocacy. We feel like we’re spinning our wheels right now.”

Henry said peer support workers and advocacy groups have pushed the province to take initiatives in addressing its high number of overdoses.

“They are critical, their voice is critical at our table. I will continue to reach out and I know the value of people with lived experience and families that are dealing with these issues,” she said.

Guy Felicella, peer clinical adviser with the Overdose Emergency Response Centre and the B.C. Centre on Substance Use, said the voices of people with personal experiences are vital because they understand issues such as discrimination and stigma against drug users battling a chronic relapsing condition of addiction.

“It breaks my heart that people who use drugs are a symbol of tokenism at the table when they should be the main ingredient, and until that changes, unfortunately, people are walking away,” said Felicella, who overdosed six times before seeking treatment.

“It’s extremely challenging for me to watch the lack of action that’s implied in this crisis when I see the response on the COVID side of things.”

Almost 6,000 people have fatally overdosed in B.C. since 2015; a health emergency that is still in effect was declared by the province in 2016.

Pottie has a second dinosaur — a duckbill parasaurophus — that he hopes to collect from Langley this week.

“He breathes. His head goes up and down. It looks like he’s going to bite you,” Pottie said Monday, adding that Lance also growls and snorts but doesn’t walk.

Once Lance was installed on Pottie’s Lantzville property at 7890 Clark Dr. West, “we stayed up there half the night sitting there with him.”

Pottie said he spent more than $40,000 to buy the two beasts at Able Auctions’ online auction this month. The dinosaurs used to be part of a travelling exhibition.

Asked if there’s been any buyer’s remorse, he replied: “Oh, no way!”

“From the time we got him home here and started putting him together, you can’t even measure the amount of fun and excitement we’ve had with the dinosaur so far,” he said.

Friends sent Pottie information on the upcoming online auction, suggesting he was “the kind of guy who would get involved in this.”

After all, he already had an old fire truck, an imitation fort (with a out-of-commission U.S. civil war cannon on its way) and more displays on the property where his companies DJ Excavating and Country Buds Dispensary are located.“I’m like a kid at heart.”

On auction day, he was prepared. “You had to bid really fast and the prices were going through the roof on these things.”

Bids were starting at $10,000 for some items.

“We had a lot of fun,” he said.

His secretary was on the computer doing the bidding. “She was just spending my money like crazy,” Pottie said with a laugh.

Pottie and two of his workers took a truck and trailer to the mainland, where the auction site was ready with a forklift to transfer the 2,800-pound dinosaur in a special travelling rack. The dinosaurs were designed to come apart.

“When I pulled into the ferry terminal in Tsawwassen, it went crazy. Everybody emptied out of their vehicles and had to come over and see the dinosaur.”

When he got home, Pottie posted a notice online that whoever came up with a name would receive $50 and another $50 would be donated to the food bank. He plans to do the same thing for dino No. 2.

Pottie, a former candidate for mayor, chose the name Lance “because he lives in Lantzville.”

Locals are pouring into Pottie’s yard to view the dinosaur. “It’s going nuts here.”

Lance runs on a timer, operating for four minutes and then pausing. Pottie gets a kick out of startling visitors.

“I have a remote control in my desk in my office. And when I see people standing around and getting their picture taken, I’ll turn it on and it’ll start making noise.”

When children get up close to Lance, “their eyes just light up,” he said. “It’s priceless.”

Corey Yantha, president of Dispension Industries Inc., said his company’s machines will be leased to pharmacies and safe injection sites in Dartmouth, N.S., London, Ont., and Vancouver and Victoria. Dispension will provide all of the data-management services.

“A person can access the machine by simply scanning their palm and the machine will know that this person gets this dose [amount] and it will dispense their medication within 15 seconds,” Yantha said in a recent interview.

The machines look like ATMs, weigh about 360 kilograms and are called MySafe Verified Identity Dispenser. They are tamper-proof and provide a safe way for addicts to get clean opioids such as hydromorphone instead of off the street.

The initiative is an extension of a pilot project using the machines that began late last year in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside — an area that has been at the centre of the opioid crisis.

It’s estimated more than 15,000 Canadians have died of an opioid-related overdose since January 2016. More than 5,000 of those deaths have occurred in British Columbia alone.

“We’ve had a pilot going in Vancouver since December,” Yantha said. “We dispensed nearly 4,000 packets of opioids to people who were at risk.”

The MySafe pilot project is the brainchild of Dr. Mark Tyndall, who has spent 20 years working in harm reduction and is a professor of medicine at the University of British Columbia’s school of population and public health.

He said the initial pilot enrolled 20 people, with 10 to 12 participants who remain active for follow-up surveys. Tyndall said there were no overdoses involving people who used the machines and about a third of participants have claimed to have stopped their street drug use.

“The sample size is really small obviously, but it’s had a huge impact to the people’s lives that are currently using it,” he said in a recent interview. “We need more numbers to really show that’s happening and the deployment of five more machines will give us some more evaluative power to do that.”

A study published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal called on Canada to seek a new approach in battling the overdose crisis.

The study’s lead author, Dr. Alexis Crabtree of the University of British Columbia, said an often-overlooked approach is the use of opioids such as methadone and buprenorphine to treat opioid addiction. Researchers showed that few people with those kinds of opioids in their system overdose.

Tyndall said there is street-level support for safe, drug-supply efforts such as the MySafe program.

“The problem right now is getting the system engaged,” he said. “Providing an actual safe supply still has a lot of barriers because, in fact, we are asking physicians to prescribe drugs where they have been told not to prescribe because they are dangerous. So getting over that hurdle is ongoing.”

Tyndall said the machines are programmed to an individual drug user’s needs, while giving them a certain amount of autonomy and also freeing them from stigma.

“If they know that they have a secure supply of these drugs their life changes automatically,” he said. “They don’t have to get up in the morning and go and steal something or find money in the informal economy.”

People registered for the program have to have a history of overdose and also must have tested positive for fentanyl in their urine. An encrypted profile is created for them using data from urine samples and from a biometric scan of the vein patterns in their palms.

Incorporated since 2017, Dispension had been focused on securing distribution of regulated products such as medical and recreational cannabis.

“In 2018 we shifted gears,” Yantha said, “to using this technology for harm reduction. We think this (MySafe) is an innovative, cost-effective approach in dealing with an overdose crisis that has dragged on far too long.”

Earlier this month, Dispension received a $500,000 loan from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency to help build dispensing machines for the program."

This summer, discover larger-than-life mountains and outdoor adventure in places like Fernie, Revelstoke, and Valemount. While the journey may take longer, the experience will leave you awestruck.

Explore Dramatic Mountain Landscapes

Once you’ve been, you know. Mountain ranges in this part of BC are on a different scale. Even the most seasoned adventurist is speechless at the sight of the Rocky Mountains. Mount Robson Provincial Park, home to the largest peak in the Canadian Rockies, is a must-see.

This area is home to seven UNESCO-designated parks, including Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park. Explore the mountain ranges with a lift-accessed alpine hike, or plan a stay in a backcountry lodge surrounded by ancient peaks.

Enjoy Outdoor Adventures

If you love the outdoors, you may have already paid a visit to the Kootenays or Valemount for the abundance of activities. But, once is never enough. From hiking to biking, paddling to golfing, there’s plenty to keep you entertained.

With four lift-accessed bike parks (including Golden’s Kicking Horse Mountain Resort) and 600-plus trails, the Kootenays are a mountain biker’s paradise. Whether your ascent is lift- or leg-powered, you can conquer some of BC’s best-known bike trails, maneuvering through tight singletrack and wheeling through alpine wildflowers.

Paddle the calm waterways or navigate raging rapids. Kootenay Lake, home to the world’s largest trout species, is prime for fishing. Tip: hire a guide for insider knowledge. Meanwhile, tee time is served with spectacular mountain views when you golf at one of the 25 championship courses in the Kootenays.

Experience Authentic Mountain Culture

A trip to BC’s mountain towns, as wild and vibrant as the nature surrounding them, is a rite of passage for every British Columbian. Tucked into valleys, on shores of rivers, and along old railway routes, communities like Fernie and Cranbrook are pulsing with energy and entrepreneurial spirit. Spoiler alert: the vibe is infectious, if you haven’t already been.

As you may have observed, a feverish pursuit of outdoor activities and great coffee are common traits, but each town has its own personality and charm. Swing by a java joint, like Nelson’s Oso Negro, to find friendly faces and a laid-back vibe. Absorb the ethos of each place by visiting Indigenous-owned businesses, exploring historic attractions, popping into boutiques, and meeting interesting characters.

In the mountains, a day of adventure almost always ends with an après. Sip craft beer on a sun-drenched patio, and live like the locals do—if only for a short while."

For every fresh peach that's devoured, there's an orchard to cycle through. For every Pinot that's sipped, there's a paddle that first needs to be dipped in a cool lake. So, embrace this delectable yin and yang, and rediscover your next great BC adventure.

Explore the Fraser Valley

In British Columbia, we’re blessed with natural settings that are as fruitful as they are beautiful. Rolling fields, vineyards, and wide-open spaces are all ready for exploration—and adventure.

A trip just east of the city to the Fraser Valley is the quickest way to immerse in farm life. Beginning in Langley, you can nibble your way from farm to farm to Abbotsford and beyond—all family-run operations that boast everything from fresh-from-the-garden fruits and vegetables to homemade waffles, ice creams, and ciders. Among the pretty landscapes and grazing cattle, you can ride the rapids during a river-rafting excursion or try your hand at catch-and-release sturgeon fishing near Chilliwack. To understand more about local Indigenous culture, opt for a guided tour of the area’s significant sites.

Road Trip to the Okanagan

There are many ways to journey to the Okanagan, and we know them all: the oft-travelled Highway 1; scenic Highway 7; Highway 5/Highway 97, a.k.a. “the fast route”; and Highway 3/Highway 97. But don’t rush along these corridors.

Fuel up at coffee shops and dig into some of the best home cooking anywhere at famed roadside diners in Hope. With bellies full, test your mettle on winding trails or seek out quiet spots at local green spaces. Pedal fast and furious at bike parks or visit historic ranches and outdoorsy resorts, and consider staying awhile.

That dance of hot pizza delivered to doorsteps around the world has played out in massive numbers since the World Health Organization declared the pandemic in mid-March and people started staying in and sheltering at home.

Victoria’s own masters of the pizza have seen more than their share of no-contact take-out and delivery orders across the threshold during the pandemic, but despite strong sales they have not been immune to the pressure and downside of trying to operate when the world is running at half pace.

Dimitri Mavrikos, whose family founded the Island’s five Romeo’s restaurants, said they have a delicate balancing act to manage in keeping the restaurants open and churning out pizza like they have since 1974.

Mavrikos noted their locations all have large dining rooms that have been struggling like all restaurants, while their take-out and delivery business has been strong and able to pay the bills.

“It helps, I think, when you have a good product and you’ve been a big part of the community for so many years,” he said, noting customer loyalty has been especially important over the last few months. “Even though it’s not a good time for anybody right now, when it comes time to pick up and deliver pizza we are still in business.”

At a time when dine-in revenue is down because of capacity restrictions, Romeo’s has had to deal with the added costs of safety equipment and supply-chain disruptions. Scarcity of items meant some costs have jumped by as much as 15 per cent.

Mavrikos said in order to deliver a quality product you need to pay for good ingredients.

“But what are you going to do right now, raise prices? Everyone is hurting, and if we raise prices it is going to feel like we are gouging people,” he said. “It’s hard to run the day-to-day business and make it successful without hurting yourself and hurting your customers as well.”

He said they decided to hold steady on pricing and be thankful for their strong foundation in the community; demand for takeout and delivery pizza and pasta will see them through this period.

That demand for pizza delivery has jumped is not in dispute.

Local players all say their takeout and delivery sales have been strong enough to keep the doors open, and the international food corporations that have to report financial results publicly paint a picture of a world that is fueled by mozzarella and pepperoni.

Domino’s recently reported a 30 per cent spike in profits and has massive plans to hire people around North America. Pizza Hut’s parent company, Yum Brands, reported this year that pizza take-out sales reached an eight-year high and revenue from take-out and delivery increased by double digits in the second quarter.

Papa John’s reported sales in North America increased by 28 per cent in the second quarter of this year around North America compared to the same time last year. It also has plans to hire thousands of people.

Pizza Hut, however, has announced it will close 300 restaurants — most of them dine-in locations — that are not designed for take-out and delivery.

Mark Murr, owner of Ali Baba Pizza, said the big guys like Domino’s do big business in Victoria, but they generally cater to a different market than local places like Ali Baba, Romeo’s, Hot House or Pizza Prima Strada.

“Sometimes you want a high-end pizza, and sometimes you want something cheap and quick,” he said, noting everyone wants McDonald’s sometimes.

Murr said the size of the big players and their massive advertising budgets actually helps the local pizza guys.

“They have created an avenue for us,” he said, noting when a Domino’s or Pizza Hut ad comes on TV it may get a regular Ali Baba customer thinking about pizza and picking up the phone. “I always look at it as a positive.”

Murr said their business is steady, if not strong right now.

“We are shifting how we do business. We are not as profitable as we were but are operating to keep our family working and our staff working with us,” he said. “We want to make sure everyone is safe and survives through this and their families are all going to be okay.”

Murr said they have beefed up their online presence and enabled online ordering from their six Island locations.

“It’s all had its ups and downs. Many of our stores are doing well, but not as well as they were,” he said. They have lost their wholesale business, which included the university, arena and school programs, and daytime sales downtown have dropped because people are working from home.

But they have seen some strong sales since re-opening their Swartz Bay location at the ferry terminal and good return on their online investment.

“We are adapting and doing our best,” he said. “That’s something entrepreneurs do best, we adapt and pivot quickly where larger agencies can’t really do that.”

George Papaloukas, owner of Hot House Pizza, agrees, noting his company’s four locations have had to recover quickly after losing its UVic business – it had three small outlets on campus.

“But the regular business has been good, though the last two weeks of March were challenging,” he said. “It helped that [early in the pandemic] a lot of restaurants had closed down.”

Hot House also improved its online order service and paid its staff bonuses in the early stages of the pandemic, in appreciation for staying and working.

Papaloukas said his stores have continued to see steady business, plenty of pizza-by-the-slice sales and very little cash.

“Nothing really changed for us other than limiting the number of customers in the store and less cash,” he said.

One other factor that could play into the hands of the local pizza players is that the NHL and NBA are back on TV and the Vancouver Canucks have advanced to the next round of the playoffs.

“Hockey nights are very strong and always help,” said Mavrikos, though the slightly pessimistic fan couldn’t help but point out “it could all be over soon.”

Landowner Wesbild Holdings Ltd. hopes to redevelop the southern 2.6 hectares of the site at McKenzie Avenue, Shelbourne Street and Cedar Hill Road for a mixed of commercial and residential uses.

A total of four, six-storey buildings would go up. Plans call for 598 rental units and 19,096 square metres of new commercial space. A six-metre-wide pedestrian and cycling connector is proposed to link Arrow Road through to Shelbourne Street.

There are some sticking points, though. The municipality is keen to see underground utility lines installed along the Cedar Hill Road side of the project but the developer has indicated an unwillingness to do so because the cost could reach $1 million, council heard. Council would like to see “significant trees” in this project and if above-ground wiring is used then those trees could be pruned by B.C. Hydro, Coun. Judy Brownoff said.

Another issue is Wesbild’s proposal to put in 20 electrical vehicle charging stations. Some council members said they want that number increased. Saanich earlier voted to require every new residential unit to have a line which could be used for an EV charger, Coun. Colin Plant said.

The third issue concerns a planned day-care on the second floor in one of the buildings. The applicant is concerned about the implications for that level if a day care operator can not be found, Plant said.

The aim is to iron out these issues prior to a public hearing. No date has been set.

The plan includes $500,000 from Wesbild to Saanich’s affordable housing fund. Contributions anticipated from the development would total $1.56 million, municipal staff said in a report.

The residential component of the project would include micro units, studios, one bedroom, one bedroom and den, two bedroom and three bedroom units. All would be designated as rental in perpetuity. Ten per cent would be offered at 10 per cent below market value.

Home Depot would remain in place. The project does not include the service station at Shelbourne Street and McKenzie Avenue.

The Gordon Head Residents’ Association supported the additional below-grade parking but expressed concerns about the loss of commercial floor space and parking, the staff report said.

Although the Mount Tolmie Community Association said it had no objections, it recommended a hotel be considered on the property. It also expressed a desire for more three-bedroom units and is concerned about pedestrian safety.

The Quadra Cedar Hill Community Association had traffic concerns, saying parking and congestion may overflow into nearby residential streets and that traffic may back up along Cedar Hill Road. Members also said 20 EV charging stations for 399 residential parking spaces is inadequate.

Plans would see 150 trees removed from the site, many of which are small, the staff report said. They would be replaced by 262 new trees and $5,000 would go to the Saanich tree replacement fund.

Dr. Bonnie Henry has been urging us to go outside.

Over the past years, research has demonstrated the value of simply being outside. Our physical and mental well-being are supported by fresh air, trees and all the life found outside. As COVID-19 is difficult to catch when you’re outdoors, being outside is the best place to exercise as well as to enjoy our communities and cope with our anxieties and uncertainties.

At the start of the pandemic, I went walking to Beacon Hill Park each day to watch the herons building their nests. Both my walking and my observation of the yearly ritual of nest building was calming and centering.

Believing in the restorative power of being in the green and breathing world, nine years ago I helped start B.C.’s first Nature Kindergarten in the Sooke School District.

Once, while walking with some children in the forest surrounding Royal Roads University, I saw how two children, struggling with their own issues, found solace in finding slugs. Having a slug to accompany them on the walk in the forest seemed calming and grounding for them.

There is a growing group of educators who feel that young children benefit from ample time spent in the living, breathing world. Forest Schools and Nature Kindergartens have been a familiar aspect of early childhood education in Northern Europe for more than 40 years. In B.C., Nature Kindergartens have spread beyond Sooke and can now be found in Williams Lake, Salmon Arm and Abbotsford. These programs usually spend all morning outside.

By all accounts, these have been a success, and more are popping up all the time.

Spending time outdoors for learning is catching on, but licensed, full-day outdoor childcare is not legal in B.C. A year ago, a pilot project creating licensed outdoor early childhood programs began in Washington State…. So, why not B.C.?

Early childhood educators in the Victoria area have created outdoor programs for young children, but have run into licensing restrictions. These programs are licensed by the province as an assurance that they meet minimal criteria (staffing, space etc.) for their type of program, whether preschool, child care, or family child care. At the moment, programs are licensed only if they have a physical space which meets provincial requirements. But how can you license the forest, a park, or a beach?

Inspectors say outdoor ECE programs are not possible due to current legislation. Some local programs carry on without a license because the demand is there from families, but unlicensed programs cannot access subsidies for parents who need help with the fees, and they cannot provide assurance that they have met a minimal set of criteria.

The only outdoor ECE programs that can be licensed are those that have a structure, because ultimately it is the building which is licensed. Yet a quality program is not about a structure; people are the key to a good program.

There are various initiatives working to find a way to license outdoor early learning programs. But the issue is broader than simply licensing ECE outdoor programs.

Listening to the advice of health officials, early childhood educators working in currently licensed facilities are looking at ways to move programs outside.

While not all programs want to be outdoors, many educators realize more time outdoors is beneficial to both staff and children; and parents are also looking to outdoor programs as part of the solution to keep their children safe. Parents, government and educators need to have conversations about how to safely license and monitor ECE programs that are outdoors as well as to share information about good outdoor practice.

The benefits of bringing children outdoors are too strong to ignore, and families want outdoor learning options for their young children.

By having this conversation, I believe that the provincial government of B.C. could begin to license child-care programs that operate in a safe and thoughtful manner outdoors, as well as opening opportunities for broader conversations with all early childhood programs on how to be outside with young children.

Not only being able to increase child care spaces, but providing information to programs who want to heed the call to go outside. Programs in Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom have shown themselves to be safe and to benefit children’s well-being and learning. Programs are being created in New Zealand, Australia, China, Japan and most recently Washington State.

British Columbia could help lead the way for Canada in a time that needs these programs for children and for families."

The kind of meal nice to enjoy on a patio while sipping a cocktail, perhaps a margarita, mojito or rum punch.

The main dish is mojo prawns. “Mojo” is a reference to the Cuban/Caribbean-style citrusy mixture you marinate, cook and sauce the prawns with. Also flavouring the prawns are garlic, a touch of butter, which adds richness to the dish, honey, which balances the tanginess of the citrus, and aromatic spices, namely cumin and chipotle chili powder.

article continues below

Chipotle chili powder is made from ground, dried smoked jalapeño peppers. It’s sold in the bottled herb and spice aisle of supermarkets and has pleasing smoky, earthy, slightly sweet taste with a medium spice level. It’s fairly intense, so you don’t need to add a lot of it to give the mojo prawns a nice chili flavour.

Citrus also flavours the two side dishes I served with the prawns, lime cilantro rice, and Mexican-style street corn salsa.

The rice is easy to make and starts by lightly toasting the grains in hot oil.Water and flavourings are added, including lime zest and juice, and the rice is cooked until tender. You then fluff the rice with a fork and mix in chopped fresh cilantro.

The salsa is inspired by the crema slathered, cheese topped grilled corn on the cob sold by street vendors in Mexico. In this case, though, the corn is cut off the cob, charred in a hot skillet, and then mixed with the style of ingredients that street corn might be flavoured with.

For an even more filing meal, you could serve the prawns, rice and salsa with warm corn tortillas or tortilla chips, for scooping things up.

Note: All of today’s recipes do have cilantro in them, not just the rice. It’s a pungent herb that people either seem to love or loathe. If you’re in the latter camp, although the flavour of the dishes won’t be the same, you could replace it with an equal amount of mild tasting, chopped fresh, flat leaf (Italian) parsley.

Mojo Prawns

Quickly marinated, seared prawns are flavoured with a palate-awakening mixture of citrus zest and juice, garlic, spices, honey, butter and cilantro.

Preparation time: 25 minutes, plus marinating time

Cooking time: about three minutes

Makes: two servings

12 to 16 large, wild prawns (or shrimp), peeled and deveined (see Note)

1 Tbsp olive oil

1 large garlic clove, minced

1/2 tsp finely grated lime zest

1/2 tsp finely grated orange zest

1/4 tsp ground chipotle chili powder

1/4 tsp ground cumin

* pinch or two salt

1/4 cup orange juice

1 Tbsp lime juice

2 tsp honey

1 Tbsp butter, at room temperature

2 to 3 Tbsp chopped cilantro

4, 1/2 lime slices, for squeezing

Place prawns, oil, garlic, zests, chipotle chile powder, cumin and salt in a bowl and toss to combine. Let prawns marinate 20 minutes. While they marinate, combine the juices and honey in second, smaller bowl.

When prawns have marinated, set a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. When skillet is very hot, add the prawns and cook and sear them about one minute. Turn prawns over and cook about 30 to 60 seconds on the other side.

Pour juice mixture into the skillet, along with the butter and cilantro. Cook until the butter is melted and prawns are cooked through, about 30 to 60 seconds more.

Divide prawns and its sauce between two serving plates or dishes. Garnish with lime slices and serve.

Note: To peel a prawn (or shrimp), hold the end of the tail in one hand and use your other hand to grab onto its swimmerets, the little legs under the shell. Pull off the shell, leaving the very bottom portion of the tail intact. If the prawn was not sold deveined, now use a small paring knife to make a lengthwise slit along the back of the prawn. Pull out, or rinse out with cold water, the dark vein, if there is one, pat the prawn dry, and it’s ready to cook.

Lime Cilantro Rice

Lightly toasted rice steamed and flavoured with bright-tasting lime juice and zest, aromatic, emerald green cilantro and a hint of ground cumin and garlic.

Preparation time: 10 minutes

Cooking time: About 20 minutes

Makes: two to three servings

2 tsp olive oil

3/4 cup long grain white rice

1 small garlic clove, minced

1/4 tsp ground cumin

1 cup + 2 Tbsp water

1/2 finely grated lime zest

1 Tbsp + 1 1/2 tsp lime juice

1/4 tsp salt

1/3 cup chopped cilantro

Heat oil in a small pot set over medium to medium-high heat. Add rice and cook, stirring occasionally, for three to four minutes, until rice is lightly toasted. Mix in the garlic and cumin and cook 30 seconds more.

Add water, zest, juice and salt to the pot and bring to a boil. Cover rice, reduce heat to its lowest setting, and steam 15 minutes, or until tender. Fluff rice with a fork, mix in cilantro, and serve.

Mexican-style Street Corn Salsa

Smoky-tasting, skillet charred corn is featured in this salsa richly flavoured with such things as sour cream, tangy cheese, lime and cilantro.This recipe could be doubled or further expanded, if you wanted to serve a larger bowl of the salsa with tortilla chips.

Preparation time: 15 minutes

Cooking time: three minutes

Makes: about two, 1/2 cup servings

1 Tbsp olive oil

1 cup fresh corn kernels (see Note)

1/4 to 1/2 tsp minced garlic

1 Tbsp sour cream

1 Tbsp mayonnaise

2 Tbsp chopped cilantro

1/8 tsp ground chipotle pepper powder

1/2 tsp finely grated lime zest

1 Tbsp lime juice

2 Tbsp finely crumbled feta cheese

Place oil in a 10-inch cast iron or other heavy skillet set over medium-heat.When oil is hot, add corn and cook and stir until lightly charred, about three minutes. Mix in garlic and cook 30 seconds more.

Transfer corn to a shallow bowl and cool to room temperature. Add remaining ingredients and mix to combine.Cover and refrigerate salsa until ready to serve. It can be made many hours before needed.

Note: One medium to large cob of corn, after shucking and cutting the kernels off the cob, should yield the one cup needed here.

Re: “Painting all police as being racist,” letter, Aug. 20.

A letter writer concluded that since Canadian police forces include people of colour that systemic racism is not possible.

article continues below

I urge the writer to look beyond the individuals within the system, and instead look at the systems themselves. Systems founded on oppression, discrimination and misogyny cannot help but be reflected in written and unwritten codes of conduct, workplace culture and behaviour.

We cannot change the past that the present is reflected in. Acknowledging the existence of systemic racism does not discredit the good work of many police officers – but it allows them to change and shape organizations to be less racist in the future.

Our capital city is in embarrassing condition

For the first time in many months we ventured to Victoria for dinner and walk-about. We were shocked at the condition of the streets. I felt like I was driving in a northern Interior town after a long rough winter; the washboard, potholes, faded lines. We are not talking about the side streets — this is all the main streets leading into the downtown (Blanshard, Douglas, Government).

For the capital of British Columbia, this is an embarrassment. Surely while tourism is down, traffic is down, the municipal and provincial politicians would take the opportunity to improve the roads and clean up the capital city.

This city is looking dirty and unkempt. Dallas Road, once the scenic tour drive and pride of Victoria, is a mess. The park walkway is unkempt and is a dirty backdrop to a once beautiful waterfront.

Lowering our standards and letting everything deteriorate does nothing to draw people to the city. There has to be a balance struck between maintaining our capital, where it reflects the pride of our province, not a race to expose the underside of our growing homeless population, making our streets and parks and our city representative of what we have to offer.

Please open your eyes and see what we see and clean up the city.

Children could put parents at risk

It makes sense that parents are scared. Imagine having a condition or being a survivor of something that makes your immune response weaker. Any parent in this segment would already have worried about what if they could not work or passed away. Who will look after my kids? Now they will have that same worry as they send their kids to school. What if this is the start of the end of my life? Who will take care of my children? Why am I sending my kids now?

Kids will contract COVID-19 and they will spread it to their families.

When, not if, a parent or grandparent does contract COVID-19, how will we explain to the children that their parent is in ICU or worse because they went to school?

Give parents a break. Let them make their choices. For some it is life or death.

Why this radish is so large and round

Re: “Garden radishes can be enjoyed all winter,” Aug. 22.

A footnote to Lee Reich’s interesting article on garden radishes in Saturday’s Times Colonist.

He mentioned the Sakurajima variety as being particularly big and round. Sakurajima is the name of a volcanic island in Japan, out in the bay opposite the city of Kagoshima on the southern tip of Kyushu .

The volcano is very active, erupting 300 days a year and constantly spreading ash over the houses and cars of the many people who live there. They simply sweep off the dust and get on with their lives.

This often involves growing vegetables in the fertile volcanic soil including the Sakurajima variety of radish, or daikon as it is called in Japanese. The interesting aspect of the Sakurajima radish is that it is the same variety as the normal white long legged Japanese daikon we are familiar with but when it pushes its root down into the volcanic soil it encounters ever hotter temperatures. It therefore redirects its growth into its circumference and becomes very large and round, with a well deserved reputation for succulence and flavour.

Runners and the mist they leave behind

In these peculiar days of distance, masks and heightened social courtesy in an already courteous town, each day as I walk the lovely Ogden Point breakwater, dutifully following the posted “stay-plague-free” advice, I am at a loss to understand the mindsets of those who jog past everything and everyone, mask-less of course, as they steam on through us all leaving their panting shrouds of mist and droplets floating in the fresh ocean air. Why?!

Lower speed limits will limit disabled

Saanich Mayor Fred Haynes wants to lower the speed limit on city streets to 40 km/h from 50 km/h – a 20 per cent decrease.

For Handydart drivers this means a 20 per cent decrease in our speed and while we spend about 60 per cent of our time on city streets this means about 50,000 trips will be lost in a year or about a 1,000 trips a week gone.

For the disabled community this is unacceptable for any reason.

I hope other mayors will read this and understand the grave situation this idea will leave our most vulnerable.

Victoria has done a lot of this nonsense and the difficulties at Handydart have greatly increased because of these decisions.

Feel lucky enough to open schools?

Perhaps as a person with no children, and no skin in the game, I perhaps may presume to comment on the issue of sending children back to school in the middle of a pandemic.

We have already seen the results of sending children back to school in various countries, for example, from the terrible example of Israel, to the better of example of Denmark.

It seems that the better examples are a result of more stringent requirements of lower class size, masks, spacing, and so forth. These better requirements are of course more expensive. Thus we should demand of our provincial government a cost/benefit analysis of their school reopening plan; for example, how many children do their plans project will be infected, to how many will they spread the disease, and how many people will sicken and die as a result. These projections have been publicly lacking, subjected to feel-good stories of homilies and sermons.

For the parents, of course, there is only one question. Are you feeling lucky?

Fifty people indoors is too many

Why are we allowing gatherings of up to 50 people indoors? This seems far too many. How can they possibly maintain distance with those numbers? Also, once you allow that many it is easy to see how it could rapidly escalate via social media.

I see Hawaii is considering limiting indoor gatherings to ten only. I think we should be reducing our allowable gathering size to a much smaller number than 50.

Wear masks and face shields

Why is it that I am still walking into grocery stores and drug stores and finding most customers not wearing a mask or a face shield?

Grocery aisles are not being monitored, even with arrows on the floor, and personnel are in tight groups chatting around the customer service counter.

Either we are serious about this virus or we are not. I just don’t see managers of some stores making much of a move to enforce rules.

People should not be walking around grocery stores and pharmacies with no masks or shields. Someone has to start making rules and sticking to them.

We need help from the province to enforce these rules.

Sow the seeds outdoors in March, weather and soil conditions permitting. Store the seeds over the winter in a labelled envelope placed in a dry, dark, uniformly cool place. I use the cupboard beside my north-facing front door, where temperatures stay cool.

article continues below

Dear Helen: Are Burdock plants aggressive weeds? On walks through my rural Saanich neighbourhood I’ve noticed a patch of the plants, now grown about 120 cm tall and starting to flower. Should I be concerned about them?

M.B.

Burdock is invasive. It is listed as a noxious weed in several interior areas of the British Columbia mainland where the plants have become troublesome. They grow up to two metres tall, with erect, branched stems and large, heart-shaped, wavy-edged leaves.

Burdock is a biennial, meaning that the plants flower and set seed in their second year, but they can live for up to four years. The plants produce lavender-purple flowers from July to October, followed by round, bristly, clinging burs. Every plant can produce up to 16,000 seeds over its lifetime.

The key to preventing burdock from spreading is to cut the plants down before they flower, so that no seeds can be produced. The seeds spread easily as hooked spines on the burs (seed capsules) cling fast to clothing and to passing animals

It is thought that burdock was introduced from its native Eurasia in the 1700s, as food and medicine. The entire plant is edible. Young leaves are used like spinach, the flower stalks like celery, tender first year taproots in soups and stews.

Dear Helen: Honeysuckle has always been one of my favourite flowers, but my small yard has no room or suitable site for it to grow well. Can honeysuckle be grown and maintained successfully in a container?

B.B.

Almost any plant can be grown in a container if the container is large enough, but honeysuckle will not grow as well in a pot as in the open garden. If you decide to try, use the largest pot or tub possible. Keep the plant well watered, and fertilize regularly. Pruning helps to confine the plant, with a main pruning in late winter.

Though most honeysuckle vines are fairly rampant, one of the newer ones, called Peaches and Cream, is more compact than most. I came across this variety quite by chance. A gardener I’d helped with some advice came by one day with a Peaches and Cream plant she’d just bought. She asked me to do prune it back for her before she planted it.

A rooted cutting made from a pruned stem gave me a plant, which has proven to be very easy-care. I keep stems with faded flowers cut back, and prune it back almost to the framework stems in late winter or early spring. It produces highly scented, dark purple-red and cream flowers through spring and summer. I notice that Monrovia, a major supplier of plants to our local garden centres, recommends Peaches and Cream for growing in containers.

Consider contacting a few of your local garden centres to see which ones stock this plant. Honeysuckle can be planted in either early spring or early autumn, but for growing in a container I would opt for a spring planting. A newly potted plant might not fare well in a cold winter. Plant as early as possible in the spring to give the plant time to root well while the weather remains cool.

Dear Helen: In Europe, covering gardens in rocks to reduce work and the need to water — a practice seen often in gardens here — is discouraged as people are urged to plant pollinator flowers in any space they have. Crop yields here and throughout North America have been limited by a lack of bees and other pollinating insects. Do you agree that stone gardens should be discouraged?

H.C.

I agree with environmental groups and gardening organizations that everyone who can should consider seeding patches of “pollinator” flowers to help expand populations of the insects upon which much of our food supply depends.

I think encouragement, with an emphasis on the beauty, easy care, and urgent importance of such plantings is the best path to increasing the presence of pollinator-friendly flowers in our gardens."

Our strata corporation held an information meeting a week ago regarding the use of our facilities to determine what measures we can take to enable the opening of our clubhouse and outdoor pool.

The strata council has held a position of keeping everything closed, but our residents and their guests and contractors walk through our lobby, common areas and use our elevators daily, so why would the use of our common facilities be a higher risk than the transient use of our common areas?

Do you have examples of how other strata corporations are managing this situation?

DK Wilson, Kelowna

British Columbia hosts a broad variety of strata corporations by location, design, size and density. For this reason, every strata council and community will need to assess what is the best solution for the health and safety of its residents.

Best practices don’t necessarily demand the closure of our facilities or require us to cease general operations, but they do require us to critically assess the risks of exposure that may arise from access to common areas and facilities.

Before your strata corporation opens your common facilities to users, develop management protocols for contact tracing, cleaning and sanitization schedules, and a community response in the event there is a COVID-19 outbreak in your strata corporation.

You are correct, the risks of exposure may be higher from transient users of our properties than the collective residents safely using common facilities.

It is possible to safely manage the use of pools, gyms, recreation rooms, guest suites, libraries, terraces, gardens and interactive common use areas, but it requires a collective investment by the community, close monitoring to ensure the protocols are observed, and a focus on the best interest of safety of all residents.

Before you consider opening your facilities, walk through the spaces and observe all the potential contact locations where the virus may be spread and locations where social distancing may not be possible. These will be your target areas to manage use of space, sanitization, or perhaps closures to avoid higher risks.

Set down a written policy on janitorial functions and sanitization. When will the areas be cleaned, who will clean them and what frequency will products be applied? Distribute and install hand sanitizer stations around your common areas.

Consider a mask policy for the protection of everyone in your community. Social distancing is realistically not effective in elevators and in most common area corridors. Follow the public health officer’s lead on social distancing and mask applications for public spaces.

Strata common areas, after all, are the public spaces of your community. The recommendations are for the collective protection of all residents.

A strata council may adopt new rules during the year, and the options around the use of common facilities and requirements such as social distancing, use of masks and regulations on access to common amenities can be included in those rules.

The intention is not to create an enforcement model but to ensure everyone in your community is well informed with the same information. Print new policies and rules, distribute them to all owners and tenants and post them in obvious locations. If you establish new rules, review your existing rules and bylaws first to confirm you are not imposing contrary conditions. And remember, rules do not apply to strata lots.

To assist your community, CHOA has posted sample guides for mask policies, how to respond if there is an outbreak in your community and a pool management policy. Go to the COVID section of the CHOA website.

If it is established, the new BIA would be mainly centred around Commercial Street, including feeder streets up to that area. “It’s really very much a centre-of-city initiative,” Kim Smythe, chief executive of the Greater Nanaimo Chamber of Commerce, said Monday.

It would be independent of two other downtown associations, one in the Old City Quarter and another for the Victoria Crescent area, he said.

A new BIA would create an “organization that actually does speak on behalf of the businesses that are focused around the core of the city. Once they have a voice then they can advocate for themselves at city hall. They can market themselves because they are a compact shopping precinct unto themselves,” Smythe said.

“They can start to drive what they want to see down there in terms of events and promotions and marketing, security and beautification.”

There hasn’t been a BIA in Nanaimo since 2017.Council voted early that year to halt more than $230,000 in annual grants, which matched the amount the organization received from its members. Nanaimo decided to pull its grants after an outside review found it was rare for local governments to fund BIAs.

A few months later, the organization voted to close.

After the previous BIA folded, the Chamber stepped in as an advocate on behalf of downtown, Smythe said.

“About a year ago, we started to work towards re-engaging the downtown business community members and pursuing a BIA,” he said. He anticipates that this fall, a petition will go out to property owners for them to vote on whether they want to be part of a BIA.

A new non-profit society has been formed called the Downtown Nanaimo Business Association.

If the petition is successful, then Nanaimo council would pass a bylaw in the new year and it would be official by July 2021.

The levy is based on property value, with thepercentage determined by city hall, Smythe said.

Success in a petition requires 50 per cent of the owners representing at least 50 per cent of the property value within a specific area.

“Unfortunately, it’s not as easy as simply enforcing the [7 a.m. to 7 p.m.] camping bylaw without a better plan in place. … Because where will 300 people go all day with all of their things?” she said in a text message.

Like other indoor spaces during the pandemic, shelters and agencies serving homeless people have had to reduce their capacity to slow the spread of COVID-19.

The meeting will be closed to the public so council can receive legal advice. Helps said any decisions about bylaws will be made at a meeting open to the public when council resumes on Sept. 3.

Many residents have called on the city to return to enforcing the camping bylaw, which requires people to pack up their tent and belongings every morning by 7 a.m. Council voted to suspend enforcement of the bylaw during the pandemic to ensure people have a place to self-isolate.

Friends of Beacon Hill Park Society, which aims to protect the park’s natural and cultural history, plans to sue the city over the decision to allow 24/7 sheltering.

The society has launched an online fundraising page to collect donations to pay for legal action against the city, raising more than $3,800 as of Monday afternoon.

Roy Fletcher, president of the society, said the decision to allow 24/7 sheltering violates the terms of the park trust, because the park is intended to be for “the use and enjoyment of the public,” rather than for utility.

“Camping is utility. It’s establishing a permanent home in a park, and telling people this is your home and you can defend it as you need to. And some people in the camp, of the campers, are taking this very seriously. They think this is their permanent home,” Fletcher said.

He said there have been people sheltering overnight in the park for years, and he would be satisfied if the city began enforcing the bylaw again to prohibit daytime camping.

Only Coun. Geoff Young opposed the decision to suspend enforcement, but now at least one other councillor says she would support reinstating the time limit on sheltering.

Coun. Charlayne Thornton-Joe said she was originally in favour of the decision to allow 24/7 sheltering in parks, because the pandemic reduced shelter beds and closed day programs for people who are homeless. Thornton-Joe said her decision was also informed by guidelines for municipalities provided by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry that said “clearing or moving encampments without providing shelter/housing immediately can cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers.”

Since the vote to suspend bylaw enforcement, more than 340 people have moved into motel rooms funded by the province and many day programs have reopened. Thornton-Joe said it’s those changes, as well as the growing frustration and safety concerns voiced by residents about the encampments, that has changed her mind.

“It’s just becoming too entrenched, and safety issues for the public and for those that are even camping is now raised to a level that has brought me concerns, and it’s been a concern for a little while for me.”

Young said council has received “floods of emails” complaining about interactions with campers, theft, people casing buildings, discarded needles and garbage. He said packing up every day is inconvenient for those living in tents, but campers have become too entrenched in the park, with large structures and collections of big items, like furniture, barbecues and generators. He said council has received many letters from park users who say campers treat them like “interlopers” trespassing in their home.

“From the point of view of impacts on the park environment and other park users, it is absolutely preferable to prohibit day-time permanent camping,” Young said.

Advocates for the homeless say that an end to 24/7 sheltering will disperse a large group of people with nowhere to go, transferring the issue somewhere else, instead of solving anything. “Where would they put their tents during the day?” said Julian Daly, CEO of Our Place, adding that shelters are “pretty full” because they’re operating at limited capacity to meet physical distancing requirements.

Daly said many people would likely lose their tents, because they would have nowhere to store them during the day.

“If they lose that … that’s their home right now. They don’t have any access to other shelter right now, so if they lose their tent, they lose their shelter. It’s as simple as that, really.”

He said forcing people to pack up in Beacon Hill Park will see campers move to other parts of the city, sending the concerns of Beacon Hill Park neighbours to other areas.

“We do understand the fears and concerns that citizens have about camping. I get that. I really do. But at the same time, we’re also concerned for those who have the camps as their only home, and what that would mean toww lose even that meagre home,” Daly said.

“Really as a society, we’ve got to sort this once and for all, so that the people who are feeling fearful about people camping don’t need to have those fears anymore, because the people aren’t camping there, because they’ve been found homes, permanent homes. That way I think everyone would be happy.”

Kelly Roth, executive director of the Coalition to End Homelessness, said forcing tenters to pack up every morning would lead to people travelling from place to place through Victoria streets looking for a place to rest, whether in other parks, in doorways, or other places that feel relatively safe. “I’m not saying encampments are the ideal situation, but having 250 people or so wandering the streets every day, every night looking for a place to be is not a solution either.”

Roth said overdose deaths — which hit record levels in May and June, killing 346 people in B.C. in two months — would likely increase if those camping in the park had to pack up and move along every morning, because people who are now living in a community could find themselves isolated and using drugs alone. Breaking up the community would also make it more difficult for outreach workers and health care professionals to provide help to those in need, she said.

“It’s one thing when you know where someone is and can get to them with prescriptions or with whatever kind of a medical program they’re on. Once they’re moving and the outreach workers that work in harm reduction are just trying to find them, that’s going to be challenging,” Roth said.

Dr. Theresa Tam made the comments during a news conference Tuesday while responding to the Statistics Canada survey, which found nearly one-quarter of respondents unlikely or unsure whether they would get a COVID-19 vaccine.

Many experts and political leaders have touted the successful development and widespread rollout of a vaccine as essential for an eventual return to normalcy, including the full reopening of economies and ending physical distancing.

More than 76 per cent of respondents in the Statistics Canada survey indicated they would likely get inoculated if and when a vaccine is ready. Yet 14 per cent said they were somewhat or very unlikely to do so. Nine per cent remained unsure.

Those who indicated they were unlikely to get a vaccine were asked to identify the reasons for their reluctance. More than half cited a lack of confidence in its safety while a similar number said they were worried about potential risks and side effects.

About one-quarter of respondents, who were allowed to give more than one answer, said they did not consider it necessary to get the vaccine while about 10 per cent indicated they did not believe in vaccines at all.

More than one-third said they would likely just wait until the vaccine seemed safe.

The survey also indicated younger Canadians and those who don't have a university degree are more likely to be hesitant or nervous about a vaccine than those who are older and more educated.

The crowd-sourced survey of around 4,000 Canadians was conducted between June 15-21. It cannot be given a margin of error because the participants do not represent a random sample.

Asked about the survey, Tam underscored the importance of ""vaccine confidence,"" describing it as integral to the successful rollout of vaccine.

She went on to promise that regulators won't take any shortcuts with safety despite the government agreeing to several changes to the clinical-trial process to get a potential COVID-19 vaccine developed faster.

""Just because it's an accelerated process to get vaccines for Canadians does not mean we're going to shortchange anything on safety and effectiveness,"" Tam said. ""I do have confidence in our regulatory system.""

Tam also took aim at the spread of falsehoods about vaccines online.

""I do think social media and internet companies do have responsibilities in terms of their role in the space,"" she said.

""So I would look towards different partners, different government departments also coming together to look at how we better address some of the misinformation that's in that space.""

She is not the first to speak out on this issue, as some have blamed the growing number and influence of anti-vaccination groups online for a resurgence in childhood diseases such as measles.

Facebook announced last year that it would be cracking down on so-called ""anti-vaxxer"" groups, which included labelling posts deemed as containing false information about vaccines. The social media giant now being sued by one such group in California.

Josh Greenberg, a communications professor at Carleton University who has been studying Canadians' attitudes towards a COVID-19 vaccine, said safety concerns aren't unexpected, given the pressure governments and industry are facing to get something working fast.

Yet he said it is essential that Ottawa push back against misinformation campaigns, which have been growing in numbers and influence even as governments around the world have been slow to react.

""When you look at issues like COVID-19 and the campaign to ready or prepare the public for the eventual release of a vaccine, you're talking about a battle for both hearts and minds,"" Greenberg said.

""It's not just an information battle of trying to make sure that people have accurate information, but that you are persuading them in such a way that they trust the veracity of the information you're providing and they also trust the source of that information.""

While the world is rushing to find a vaccine for COVID-19, new reports of several people having been reinfected with the novel coronavirus after testing positive once before raise concerns that it might be a moving target.

Deputy chief public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo said the cases in Hong Kong, Belgium and the Netherlands highlight ongoing questions about immunity to COVID-19 and the need for an effective vaccine.

Here's a look at how the new programs will work:

What is happening to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and Employment Insurance?

The government is extending the CERB by an additional four weeks, thus offering a maximum 28 weeks of benefits. After that maximum is reached the government will launch a ""simplified"" EI program and three new kinds of benefits on Sept. 27.

Those on CERB will be able to transition to EI if they qualify under new parameters.

How many hours do you have to work to qualify for the new EI?

Canadians will now qualify for EI after working as few as 120 insurable hours, the equivalent of about 3.5 weeks, in the last 52 weeks.

EI claimants will receive a one-time credit of about 300 insurable hours for claims, if they have lost their job, or 480 insurable hours, if they have taken leave for a sickness, pregnancy or parental, compassionate care or family caregiver reasons.

Those credits will be available for one year and retroactive to March 15 for claimants who wanted to switch from CERB to EI maternity, parental, compassionate care, family caregiver or work-sharing benefits, but were stopped because they did not meet the hourly requirements.

How much money will people receive?

New EI claimants will receive at least $400 per week or $240 per week for extended parental benefits, if this is higher than their benefits would otherwise be.

Previous EI claimants were given 55 per cent of their average weekly earnings, up to a maximum $573 per week in 2020.

What is happening to the EI premium rate?

The EI premium rate is being frozen for two years at $1.58 per $100 in insurable earnings for employees and $2.21 per $100 in insurable earnings for employers.

What if I'm self-employed or don't qualify for EI?

The first of the three new benefits is the Canada Recovery Benefit for workers who are self-employed or not EI-eligible and still require income support because their work has not yet returned due to COVID-19.

This benefit will provide $400 per week for up to 26 weeks, while claimants continue to look for work.

They will be able to earn income from employment or self-employment while receiving the benefit, but need to repay 50 cents of every dollar earned above an annual net income of $38,000 through their income tax return.

The benefit will be available Sept. 27 and paid in arrears.

What if I get sick or have to isolate for COVID-19?

The government will offer the new and temporary Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit to provide income support for workers that are sick or must self-isolate because of COVID-19.

The benefit will offer $500 per week for up to two weeks and cannot be received while claimants are also taking paid sick leave.

It is also available Sept. 27 and paid in arrears.

What if I have to look after kids or family member?

The government has announced the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, a new and temporary program for workers who must miss work to care for a child under the age of 12, a family member or dependant because schools, daycares or day program facilities are closed due to COVID-19.

This benefit offers $500 per week for up to 26 weeks per household. It may be shared, but only one member of a household at any time can receive the benefit at a time.

Workers who prefer to keep dependents at home when facilities are open are not entitled to the benefit, which is effective Sept. 27 and paid in arrears too.

“COVID-19 isn’t going away any time soon,” said Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction Shane Simpson. “Essential costs are increasing in many cases so this is an opportunity to ease that pressure and we see it continuing so we’ll go through December.”

The seniors supplement for a single person is an unfathomably low $49.30 a month, said B.C. seniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie. With the supplement, it becomes $349.30 a month for the lowest-income seniors living on about $19,000 or less a year. For context, a minimum-wage job would bring in about $26,000 a year.

Mackenzie said the boost is substantial and in her mind hasn’t received the attention it’s due.

“It’s very significant for the group of people receiving this money, it’s a lot of money for very low income people,” Mackenzie said.

For a senior couple the supplement would be $120.50 and $49.83 for a spouse receiving the federal Old Age Security allowance.

“We have to find a way to continue to support these really low income seniors after COVID,” said Mackenzie.

“They were struggling before COVID, and they’re going to struggle after COVID and hopefully this will be a catalyst or a way to address this lowest income group of seniors.”

The temporary $300 crisis supplement is extended four months September through December to low-income seniors receiving the B.C. Seniors Supplement and income assistance and disability recipients residing in special care facilities.

The B.C. Senior’s Supplement tops up the federal government’s Old Age Security and/or the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).

The B.C. Seniors Supplement is not available to people who are already receiving federal employment insurance or the $2,000 monthly Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).

No low- or no-income people are still disproportionately affected by this pandemic, said Simpson.

The top up considers that seniors are paying more in prescription dispensing fees, additional travel costs for seniors avoiding public transit due to health concerns, and delivery fees for groceries.

Mackenzie said seniors are also spending more on groceries because they can’t shop around for the best prices as they did prior to the pandemic and seniors who relied on accessing the internet for free at public libraries are now having to order internet services.

Earlier this year, the Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $2.5 billion one-time, tax-free top-up payment to help 6.7 million seniors absorb costs related to COVID-19.

For April to June 2020, the maximum combined payment from OAS plus GIS is $1,514.78. The maximum for OAS is $613.53 OAS and the maximum for GIS is $916.38 GIS per month, for a single person.

The federal one-time lump-sum payment saw seniors who receive Old Age Security in Canada receive a $300 payment. Those who receive the guaranteed income supplement for low-income seniors saw an additional $200.

“I just think it’s a bunch of B.S.,” Nate Christian told CHEK News. “I had a party man, it wasn’t even a party, it was like a hangout. I gave everybody hand sanitizer, I took everyone’s name down, I showed the cops that and they did not care, they said whatever you are getting the ticket.”

Officers were called to the multi-unit residential building in the 1000 block of Fort Street twice on the weekend.

On Friday night, an estimated 40 to 60 youth were packed inside the one-bedroom suite, police said, and the room was so crowded and hot there was condensation on the windows and the party attendees were sweating.

The host was issued a $2,000 fine, plus a $300 victim-surcharge levy.

Police returned early Sunday after receiving a noise complaint. This time, a guest was arrested for obstructing a peace officer fined $230 for violating the COVID-19 Related Measures Act.

The 18-year-old male guest refused to co-operate and leave when police broke the party up, said VicPD Const. Cam MacIntyre.

“It’s disappointing and frustrating,” MacIntyre said. “It’s incredibly reckless.”

Christian said there were fewer people in attendance the second night and some were wearing masks. He said the only rule he failed to follow was the one about physical distancing.

“It wasn’t that many people, man. It’s not like I had 250 people not wearing masks — 80 per cent of the people in the house were wearing masks,” he said.

“In this small space [we can’t socially distance] … but that’s why we kicked people out because the cops were coming. So no, we weren’t following it, but when the cops came here there were only 15 people here. ”

Christian, who has been evicted, said he plans to fight the ticket.

“I am fighting them in court,” he said.

“Me and everybody who was at this party are going to testify and say we were a metre and a half apart like we spread it out and everything.”

But, he said, he is sorry: “Everyone is mad at me for it, literally all over B.C. And it’s just like, I’m sorry. It wasn’t that many people, man. It’s not like I had 250 people.”

Several tickets were also handed out in the Lower Mainland over the weekend.

Surrey RCMP said one restaurant, two event and banquet spaces, and an after-hours club were each given $2,300 tickets over the weekend, after they were caught contravening health officials’ orders about groups.

Police said all four venues had previously been issued warnings, and were among 429 checks conducted over the weekend for COVID-19 compliance.

In Richmond, police found significantly more than 50 people in a private sports centre.

A Richmond RCMP spokesperson said officers initially took “an educational approach” — as they did with several other private gatherings over the weekend — “but it was quite clear that the business needed further incentive to comply” with public health orders.

The operator of the facility was hit with a $2,300 violation ticket under the COVID-19 Related Measures Act.

Premier John Horgan said it was “disappointing” the tickets were necessary, “but we will not stand by and let a small number of people undo the hard work of British Columbians to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Thank you to the vast majority of people doing their part to keep each other safe.”

Police can recommend charges if violation tickets do not prove to be effective deterrents, or in cases of egregious contraventions or for repeat offenders. On conviction, penalties of up to $10,000 may be levied, according to the province.

“I said: ‘How did you get back here … You’d better go home now … I’m not going to let you in,” says Wright, who was crouching down to speak to the animal. “I’m standing there [less than a metre away] thinking I’m talking with a yellow lab.

“Then he turned and I said: ‘Oh hell, you’re not a dog.’ ”

Wright had in fact had a very close encounter with a cougar at 10:30 p.m. that evening, likely the same big cat that had been reported on North Dairy Road in the Hillside Centre area the day before.

The back porch light of her Carman Street home wasn’t working, but there was enough light coming through the glass door for her to see the cougar’s face, large body and long tail as it slipped into the night.

Saanich police arrived within five minutes and scouted the area but found no sign.

Two hours later as she closed her bedroom curtains, she spotted the cougar again, lying under a bush in her front yard.

“It was really a shock,” Wright said in an interview Friday. “I was checking the glass [on the deck door] for a nose print because he was right there. I’ve seen cougars in the zoo and TV … not that close.”

The Carman Street Block Watch Association sent emails to residents warning them to be on the lookout for cougars.

Another Saanich resident, Edna Hilton, said she was awakened the same night in her Torquay Drive home by a strange sound coming from outside her bathroom window at 3 a.m.

“It was like a cat, an agitated cat, but coming from something much bigger,” said Hilton.

From her dining room she could see deer running by. She moved to her living room window and saw a cougar chasing the deer. “[The cougar] moved so fast,” she said.

There have been other cougar sightings this week in Saanich near Prospect Lake and Rithets Bog.

Rick Dekelver of the B.C. Conservation Officers Service said cougar sightings have been on the increase in urban areas, and it’s likely they are pursuing their ­natural prey, deer, as that ­population increases in residential neighbourhoods.

He said cougars are not scavengers and prefer to hunt for their food. They are most active from dusk to dawn and often lay low during the day, finding cover in bushes or trees. People may pass by them without even noticing.

But they will travel in daylight because they are curious by nature, sometimes cutting through yards. “If there is something that comes within their comfort zone, they will flee,” said Dekelver.

He said cougars might also try to grab pets such a s cats and small dogs, so it’s important for residents to be watchful of their pets at all times, including those evening bathroom breaks outside.

Wright does not have any pets, but she does have water fountains in her back yard where the big cat might have stopped to rest and drink. One of her neighbours in the back along Service Street also has several cats that cut through her yard on a regular basis, and the cougar might have been watching for one to appear.

Dekelver said people should be vigilant in the evening hours. If they encounter a cougar, the first rule is never to run because it might consider you prey. “Back away slowly and speak in a loud voice,” he said.

“Don’t scream or have a shrill voice. It may think you are prey. Look big. If you have a jacket, pull it up with your arms. Pick up your child to make your silhouette bigger.

“It may have a kill that it is protecting.”

Dekelver said the presence of deer — or their sudden disappearance — is a good indicator of whether or not there is a cougar in the area.

“If you go from seeing six deer on a regular basis to nothing for a week or so, it could be a sign. [Deer] often know about cougars a lot sooner than [humans] do.”

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""","INVERMAY, Sask. — People could always tell when Aaron Ogden entered a room.

The 19-year-old had a big presence, said his father, Mark Ogden. He was a prankster, a one-of-a-kind character who would sit and talk to anybody as if he'd known them for years.

article continues below

""He wasn't afraid to make friends,"" Ogden, 50, said in a phone interview. ""This is just the way he was.

""Really easy to talk to.""

People remembered the young man's outgoing personality at his funeral this week. He died in a Calgary hospital last Saturday after collapsing on a run.

His father, a trucker, was able to be by his son's side.

He said a major blood clot had formed around a stent placed in his son's aorta. The stent was necessary after he survived a serious highway accident on his way to work last year.

""It was a miracle, really.""

Ogden said while in hospital before his death, his son told him he was supposed to go for a CT scan in June while still living in Saskatchewan near Yorkton.

It was a routine checkup on the stent, but the appointment was postponed because of restrictions around the COVID-19 pandemic and never rescheduled.

""I didn't think nothing of it at the time, but I mulled it over ... as we watched him decline,"" Ogden said.

""It hit me. He was trying to tell me: 'This shouldn't have happened.'""

The father believes that had his son's scan not been cancelled, doctors might have found the blood clot in time.

Ogden wants all postponed hospital procedures done immediately.

""People's lives are being lost,"" he said. ""These COVID rules are way too far.""

Ogden believes the Saskatchewan Health Authority bears responsibility for his son's death.

""Somebody needs to be held to account.""

The health authority halted hundreds of non-urgent surgeries, procedures and diagnostics in March to brace for the pandemic.

Two months later, when the government felt it had a handle on the spread of the novel coronavirus, it announced the resumption of health services would be staggered.

""Emergency and urgent patients are the priority for services, including diagnostic imaging,"" said Corey Miller, vice-president of provincial programs at the health authority.

""The determination of the priority is based on the evaluation of the referring physician in consultation with the patient.""

Miller said they are reviewing Ogden's case and have reached out to his family.

He said the health authority is working through the backlog of exams that were delayed during the first few months of the pandemic.

More than 1,500 CT appointments which had been booked were postponed, he said.

Ogden questions why something like a CT scan couldn't be performed in Yorkton, where the risk of COVID-19 was low.

As of Friday, health officials reported five active cases in the region, which has only seen 33 infections in total since the pandemic hit Saskatchewan.

Cheryl Camillo, a professor with the University of Regina's Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy, says speaking generally, delaying non-essential services to respond to COVID-19 was the responsible thing to do because the virus was new and spreading quickly.

""The risks are that some people don't get the essential and urgent services because so much of the workforce and the resources of the health system move towards responding to COVID,"" said the health systems researcher.

""It's very human for people to get frustrated because health care is something that is so personal.""

She says another risk of scaling back is that people can lose confidence in a health system some may perceive as having overplanned for the pandemic.

Health officials are in the tough spot of having to prepare for the worst case scenario and what could be a rapid change in case numbers, she says.

During the pandemic Camillo's own grandmother died in a long-term care home in the United States from isolation and depression, she says.

""I suffered an individual loss of my otherwise pretty healthy grandmother, but despite how profoundly sad that makes me, I understand and would defend the care home's decision to lock down.

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""

Dec. 1: Canadian authorities arrest Meng at Vancouver's airport after an extradition request from the Americans. The news becomes public on Dec. 5.

Dec. 6: China demands Canada release Meng and ""immediately correct the mistake"" officials made in arresting her. The Chinese say they were not briefed on the reasons for Meng's arrest. In Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Meng's case is part of an independent legal process with no outside political influence.

Dec. 7: Meng appears in a Vancouver court, where allegations of fraud are laid out. The U.S. alleges Meng misled American banks in a bid to get around American sanctions on Iran.

Dec. 8: Canada's ambassador to China, John McCallum, is summoned to a meeting with China's assistant foreign minister so the country can register complaints about Meng's arrest.

Dec. 9: China summons the American ambassador to China to lodge similar complaints about Meng's case and demand the U.S. rescind the order for her arrest.

Dec. 10: Chinese authorities arrest two Canadian men. Michael Kovrig, who was on leave from Global Affairs Canada, and entrepreneur Michael Spavor. Kovrig's arrest becomes public on Dec. 11. Spavor's becomes public on Dec. 12.

Dec. 11: Meng is released on $10 million bail. U.S. President Donald Trump tells Reuters that he would ""certainly intervene"" in Meng's case ""if I thought it was necessary"" to help forge a trade deal with China.

Dec. 12: China's foreign ministry says it has no information about Kovrig but says the organization he worked with — the International Crisis Group — was not registered in China, making its activities in the country illegal.

Dec. 13: Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, says the arrests of the two Canadians were plainly a response to Meng's arrest. China's foreign ministry says Kovrig and Spavor have been detained on suspicion of ""endangering national security.""

Dec. 14: Canadian officials are granted consular access to Kovrig, and McCallum meets with him in Beijing.

Dec. 16: Canadian diplomats in China are granted consular access to Spavor.

Dec. 20: Indictments unsealed in the United States allege two Chinese citizens targeted companies in Canada and around the world as part of a years-long hacking campaign to steal data.

Dec. 21: Kovrig's employer, the International Crisis Group, says he has not been given access to a lawyer while in custody. A source familiar with the conditions of Kovrig's detention says he is questioned three times a day and kept in a room with the lights on continuously. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland formally demands both men be let go, calling in a statement ""for their immediate release."" Similar statements come out from the United States, Britain and the European Union.

Dec. 24: China's foreign ministry calls out the U.S., Britain and EU, saying the trio should be condemning Canada for Meng's arrest.

2019

Jan. 3: At a news conference, China's prosecutor general Zhang Jun says Kovrig and Spavor ""without a doubt"" violated Chinese law. He says the investigation is also following the rule of law but doesn't provide more details about the allegations.

Jan. 7: The Prime Minister's Office says Trump has affirmed his respect for judicial independence. In a summary of a phone call between Trump and Trudeau, the PMO indicated the leaders discussed the high-profile U.S. extradition request — though Meng was not named — and agreed on the importance of respecting the independence of judges and the rule of law.

Jan. 9: China's envoy in Ottawa suggests Canada and its Western allies are white supremacists for calling for the release of two Canadians imprisoned last month by his country's communist government. Ambassador Lu Shaye makes the accusation in an op-ed in the Hill Times.

Jan. 14: Trudeau says he's very concerned to see China ""acting arbitrarily"" by applying the death penalty to a Canadian convicted of drug trafficking. He says Canada will do all it can to intervene on Robert Lloyd Schellenberg's behalf when a court in Dalian in northeastern Liaoning province announced it had given Schellenberg the death penalty after reconsidering his case.

Jan. 15: China expresses its ""strong dissatisfaction"" with Trudeau over his criticism of Schellenberg's sentence. Trudeau should ""respect the rule of law, respect China's judicial sovereignty, correct mistakes and stop making irresponsible remarks,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying says.

Jan. 16: The U.S. State Department says China's death sentence against Schellenberg is ""politically motivated."" A statement says U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Freeland spoke and ""expressed their concerns about the arbitrary detentions and politically motivated sentencing of Canadian nationals.""

Jan. 17: Ambassador Shaye says Canada's arrest of Meng was an act of ""backstabbing"" by a friend. Lu warns of ""repercussions"" if Canada bars the firm from its new 5G network for security reasons, as have three of its intelligence-sharing allies.

Jan. 18: Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale says the government's decision on whether to ban Huawei from being used in Canada's next generation 5G wireless network will not be influenced by threats of retaliation from China.

Jan. 22: China demands the U.S. drop a request that Canada extradite Meng. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Meng's case was out of the ordinary and Canada's extradition treaty with the U.S. infringed on the ""safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens.""

Jan. 23: Ambassador McCallum says there are strong legal arguments Meng can make to help her avoid extradition to the United States. Speaking to Chinese reporters a day earlier in the Toronto area, McCallum listed several arguments Meng's legal team can make in her defence.

Jan. 24: Trudeau dismisses calls to remove McCallum following his comments to Chinese reporters, saying such a change wouldn't help the two Canadians detained by Chinese authorities get home any sooner. Later, McCallum says he ""misspoke"" when he suggested detained Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou had a strong case to avoid extradition to the United States.

Jan. 25: McCallum tells StarMetro Vancouver it would be ""great for Canada"" if the United States drops its extradition request. ""We have to make sure that if the U.S. does such a deal, it also includes the release of our two people. And the U.S. is highly aware of that,"" he told the Star.

Jan. 26: McCallum resigns as ambassador to China at Trudeau's request.

Jan. 28: The U.S. Department of Justice formally levels criminal charges against Huawei, two subsidiaries and Meng. The charges, contained in two newly unsealed indictments, allege that Huawei misrepresented its ownership of a Hong Kong-based subsidiary to circumvent American sanctions against Iran. Furthermore, they say Huawei stole telecommunications technology, trade secrets and equipment from U.S. cellphone provider T-Mobile USA. Meng is charged with bank fraud, wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit both. In a statement, Huawei denied committing any of the violations cited in the indictment.

Jan. 29: The Canadian government says it has received a formal request for the extradition of Meng, who appears in a Vancouver court to change the people who are providing her with some of the financial sureties for her release.

March 1: The Justice Department gives the formal go-ahead for the extradition case to proceed.

March 3: Meng's defence team announces it has filed a notice of civil claim alleging ""serious violations"" of their client's constitutional rights.

March 4: China accuses the two detained Canadians of acting together to steal state secrets. Trudeau dismissed the allegation made in Chinese state media, saying: ""It is unfortunate that China continues to move forward on these arbitrary detentions.""

March 6: A lawyer for Meng tells a judge the United States bid for extradition raises serious concerns about the political motivations behind the case.

March 14: Huawei pleads not guilty in a New York court to charges accusing it of plotting to violate Iran trade sanctions. Lawyers enter the plea in federal court in Brooklyn, two weeks after Huawei pleaded not guilty to separate federal charges filed in Seattle accusing the company of stealing technology from T-Mobile.

March 22: A judge orders the RCMP to provide copies of the content on seven electronic devices owned by Meng after they were seized when she was arrested. Justice Heather Holmes of the British Columbia Supreme Court says the RCMP must make copies of data on an iPhone, an iPad, a Macbook Air, a Huawei phone, two SIM cards and a flash drive.

March 29: The federal government says it is considering subsidizing farmers hit by China's $2-billion ban on Canadian canola imports.

April 29: Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe says Ottawa needs to treat Chinese imports with the same scrutiny China is showing Canada's canola shipments.

May 1: The federal government changes a payment program for canola farmers to help those affected by China's decision to ban the Canadian product.

May 2: China suspends the export permits of two Canadian pork exporters, including Quebec-based Olymel LP, amid growing tensions between the two countries.

May 8: Meng's defence team tells a judge it plans to argue that she shouldn't be extradited to the United States because she hasn't committed fraud under Canadian laws and her arrest was unlawful.

May 9: Canadian diplomats are joined in a Chinese courtroom by American, British, French and German colleagues to watch an appeal in Schellenberg's case.

May 16: China says it has formally arrested Kovrig and Spavor, bringing them closer to trial on vaguely defined state security charges. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman says they have been arrested for allegedly stealing state secrets. Goodale says the federal government is ""deeply concerned"" about China's decision, adding that no evidence has been produced to indicate any validity to allegations made against them.

May 23: China's ambassador to Canada says the bilateral relationship is at ""rock bottom"" compared to any time since diplomatic ties were first established decades ago. In prepared text for a speech, Lu Shaye says he's saddened Canada-China relations are at what he called a ""freezing point.""

June 5: Lawyers for the RCMP and Canada Border Services Agency deny allegations that their officers searched Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou's phones and electronic devices after a border official wrote down her passwords. A joint response filed in court to Meng's civil lawsuit says a border officer asked Meng for her phone numbers and passwords in case he was required to search the devices for customs or immigration purposes. Meng's civil lawsuit filed in B.C. Supreme Court alleges ""serious violations"" of her constitutional rights and accuses officers of detaining and questioning her for three hours before notifying her of her arrest.

June 13: Freeland rejects the purported view of former prime minister Jean Chretien that the extradition request be cancelled to improve relations with China and win the release of Kovrig and Spavor. Freeland said while she respects Chretien, Canada is either a rule of law country or it is not. Chretien's comments were reported in the Globe and Mail citing anonymous sources.

June 24: Defence lawyers for Meng ask Ottawa to stop the extradition process against their client, saying the request made by the United States was for political purposes, not legitimate law enforcement reasons.

Aug. 20: Court documents released ahead of Meng's extradition hearing suggest a Canadian border official questioned her about her business before the RCMP arrested her. The nearly 1,100 pages of material released by the court were collected by Meng's defence team.

Aug. 21: Meng's lawyers allege Canadian officials acted as ""agents"" of American law enforcement while she was detained at Vancouver's airport for three hours ahead of her arrest. In court documents, they point to handwritten notes by Canadian officers indicating Meng's electronics were collected in anticipation of a request from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States.

Sept. 4. Business consultant Dominic Barton is named as Canada's new ambassador to China.

Sept. 23: The Crown says Canadian officials followed the law when they detained Meng and the defence has no proof to substantiate its ""conspiracy theory"" that she was illegally arrested. The Attorney General of Canada says in court documents that there's no evidence to suggest that the RCMP or the FBI asked border agents to elicit information from Meng during the detainment.

Sept. 24: A lawyer for Meng says there was nothing ""routine"" about the way she was questioned by border officials before she was read her rights and informed of her arrest as Meng's defence team asks the B.C. Supreme Court to compel the release of further documents to support its arguments ahead of her extradition hearing in January.

Oct. 1: A Crown prosecutor tells a judge Canadian border guards mistakenly gave the RCMP passcodes to electronic devices belonging to Meng when she was questioned at the Vancouver airport. The Crown says when the border agency realized it had made a mistake, it told the RCMP the codes could not be used or shared because they'd been obtained during a border examination.

Oct. 29: The federal government says Canada's new ambassador to China has met with Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

Oct. 31: In documents, Meng's lawyers maintain there is an ""air of reality"" to an allegation the RCMP illegally shared details of her electronic devices with the FBI, despite new affidavits from the Mounties denying the claim.

Nov. 5. A Chinese ban on the import of Canadian pork and beef products estimated to have cost farmers almost $100 million is lifted.

Nov. 24: Canada's new foreign affairs minister spends an hour in talks with his Chinese counterpart over the fate of Kovrig and Spavor. Francois-Philippe Champagne spoke with China's Wang Yi a day earlier at a G20 meeting of foreign ministers in Japan.

Nov. 28: Lawyers for Meng say the United States is ""dressing up"" its complaint that she violated sanctions as a case of fraud as they ask the B.C. Supreme Court to decline her extradition. In court documents released, Meng's legal team says the alleged misrepresentation does not amount to fraud and the transactions processed by HSBC were not illegal in Canada.

Dec. 2: Meng says she has experienced feelings of helplessness, torment and struggle since being arrested, but no longer fears the unknown. In a post on the Chinese telecom company's website, Meng says she has passed the time on bail in one of her homes in Vancouver reading books, chatting with colleagues and painting.

Dec. 10: Justice Minister David Lametti says he is troubled that Kovrig and Spavor have been denied access to lawyers as they face trials where convictions are virtually assured. Meanwhile, Meng wins an application in the B.C. Supreme Court for more documents to be disclosed as she alleges there was an abuse of process during her arrest.

2020

Jan. 23: A lawyer for Meng argues the extradition case against her is a test of whether courts will reject foreign charges that run contrary to Canadian values as a hearing wrapped up in the B.C. Supreme Court. The hearing focused on the legal test of double criminality. Crown counsel Robert Frater says the judge does not necessarily need to consider American sanctions law for the allegations to amount to fraud in Canada.

March 13: Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese Embassy in Canada says Kovrig has been allowed to have a telephone conversation with his father, who is very ill. The embassy says in a statement that they allowed the call for humanitarian reasons, and it also says Kovrig and fellow detainee Michael Spavor are being given better food to strengthen their immunity against the novel coronavirus.

May 27: Holmes rules against Meng on the double-criminality argument. The B.C. Supreme Court judge says the allegations against Meng could constitute a crime in Canada.

June 15: Lawyers for Meng accuse authorities in the United States of misleading the B.C. Supreme Court judge presiding over the extradition case. Meng's defence team says it is seeking a stay in the proceedings arguing that U.S. case records are ""grossly inaccurate and based on deliberate and/or reckless misstatements of fact and material omissions, thereby constituting a serious abuse of the extradition process.""

June 19: China charges Kovrig and Spavor with spying. Kovrig was charged in Beijing on suspicion of spying for state secrets and intelligence. Spavor was charged in Dandong city near the North Korean border on suspicion of spying for a foreign entity and illegally providing state secrets.

Aug. 25: Meng loses her battle to have the contents of six confidential documents released to her legal team after arguing in Federal Court that the redacted documents would support the position that their client suffered an abuse of process during her arrest. Justice Catherine Kane says the information contained in the documents is not relevant to the allegations of abuse described by Meng's legal team.

Last week, we discussed the major equity indices used around the world. We also addressed the terminology used and highlighted some of the pitfalls of monitoring the returns on indices.

article continues below

Exchange Traded Funds are commonly referred to as ETFs. They first emerged as a passive investment approach to mirror some of the major indices.

During periods of uncertainty, we prefer to have an active approach versus a passive approach. Individually selecting securities is preferred over buying an entire index. We have written articles in the past on the pros and cons of holding ETFs, mutual funds, or direct holdings. The purpose of this article, however, is to once again outline our concern with equity ETFs when markets are reaching near historic highs.

On Nov. 29, 2019 we wrote a similar article — Ten reasons to be cautious with Canadian equity ETFs — when the TSX Composite Index (TSX) was at 17,040. Within four months, the TSX Composite Index dropped to 11,173 (or a decline of 34.4 per cent). Once again, markets are approaching all-time highs, despite market uncertainties (i.e. COVID, economic decline, corporate earnings, political uncertainty, trade uncertainty, etc.).

We felt it prudent to revisit the reasons we feel investors should be cautious with index equity investing.

Equity ETFs that cover the broad market naturally have a Beta close to one. This means they are equal to the risk of the market. When the markets are doing well then ETFs will track that. Using the S&P/TSX 60 Index (XIU) as an example, it has a beta of 1.04 — higher than the S&P/TSX Composite Index. In June 2008, the XIU was $22.81 per share. In March 2009, the XIU traded as low as 11.41 per share. The XIU essentially dropped 50 per cent. The S&P/TSX Composite Index hit a high of 15,154 in June 2008 and declined to a low of 7,480 in March 2009. A decline of approximately 51 per cent. After the markets have had an extended run, we get particularly nervous about equity ETF style investing. Are you prepared to accept the complete downside of the equity market if it pulls back quickly?

Advocates of ETF investing are proud to highlight the returns that equal the market. I’ve never felt that the end goal of investing is to just own the market and have returns equal to the general market. Our objective at the beginning of every single year is to beat the market. Beating the market really comes down to not having an equal position in everything. You have to concentrate on a much smaller group of stocks and exclude everything else. Our end goal is to have our equities outperform the general market – not just equal the market.

I’m not convinced that a completely hands-off approach is the best approach. If you are using ETFs then we feel that you still have to manage the ETFs to ensure you’re in the correct ETFs. When we hold individual holdings, we can shift the holdings, making good strategic allocation decisions, based on economic conditions. By strategic allocation decisions I mean asset mix (per cent in cash, fixed income and equities), sector exposure, geographic exposure, and tax efficient strategies. We feel that there is extreme value in having a good portfolio manager that can help you make both tactical asset allocation and strategic asset allocation decisions.

Although ETFs are a lower cost option when compared to mutual funds, they do have costs. There are costs when you purchase and sell. They also have embedded costs within the ETF. The embedded costs with an ETF are lower than mutual funds. If an investor is seeking the lowest cost option then buying individual equities and never trading them is the lowest long term cost option. You have a one-time cost of purchasing them with no ongoing costs. We don’t recommend this approach because we feel the markets are changing and you have to adjust the equity holdings accordingly. We also feel that rebalancing and making both tactical asset allocation and strategic asset allocation decisions enhances returns. We feel couch potato investing (buy ETFs and do nothing) is not the best option for investors who have discovered working with a Portfolio Manager.

Some ETFs will have hundreds or thousands of holdings. In our model portfolios we typically limit the number of equity holdings to 25 to 35 individual common shares. We prefer to focus on the best companies and concentrate on those holdings rather than spreading the capital out over hundreds or thousands of names. I strongly believe that concentrating on the best names is a better strategy than having numerous small holdings.

We encourage investors to avoid Canadian ETFs that hold American stocks. To illustrate, we will use an investor named Jill that owns 14 individual common shares of US companies within her Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP). The US and Canada negotiated a tax treaty that exempts any withholding tax on US dividend income generated within an RRSP. Another investor named Jack decides to purchase a Canadian ETF that holds American dividend paying common shares. As the common shares are held within an ETF, it does not fall under the exemptions listed in the tax treaty. As a result, a 15 per cent withholding tax is applied on all dividend income within the ETF. This 15 per cent withholding tax is an absolute cost and is lost to the investor.

A typical client will have a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), RRSP, and a non-registered investment account (either Joint With Right of Survivorship, or Individual). In our July 26, 2019 article, we discussed placement of investments in registered and non-registered accounts. This article focused on how to get the best tax benefits from structuring your investments correctly. Individual Canadian equities that pay dividends are best in a non-registered account to claim the dividend tax credit. Individual US dividend paying equities are best in an RRSP account. The article has many tips that we help our clients with. An ETF investor often has the same holdings in each account without giving thought to the best tax structure. The ironic part about this is that the ETF investor may be saving a small amount in the ETF fee, but losing even more in tax savings by fixating only on fees.

Many companies are introducing actively managed ETFs. When I hear the term “actively managed ETFs”, I feel it is essentially moving in the direction of a mutual fund. Many mutual fund companies are also creating passive strategies as well. Many ETFs are moving towards the mutual fund space to justify slightly higher fees, and many mutual funds are moving towards the ETF space by reducing fees and hoping not to lose market share on fee-sensitive investors. These two investment worlds are somewhat colliding. Some ETFs are claiming that they have designed built-in Algorithms. This sounds really fancy and it sounds passive. Back-testing data does not guarantee future results, similar to the mandatory mutual fund disclosure that past performance is no indication of future performance. Prior to purchasing either, it is important to know all the details and consider all options, including holding individual positions with a Portfolio Manager.

ETF investors have the option of holding one or more ETFs. Both have shortfalls in my opinion. If you are holding only one ETF – which ETF would you hold? If you purchase XIU, for example, then you are completely missing everything outside of Canada. On the flip side, some ETF investors will hold several different types of ETF holdings. They may hold a sector ETF, a broad market ETF, and an ETF that holds only dividend-paying equities. As a Portfolio Manager we have tools that retail investors do not have. What we have discovered when we have used these tools is the haphazard approach of combining random ETFs can result in duplication of the underlying holdings and there may be good opportunities that the ETF investor has no exposure to. The more ETF holdings an investor has, the more challenging it becomes to monitor the sector exposure, geographic exposure, and individual company exposure. This becomes even messier when you mix mutual funds and ETFs together.

Similar to a mutual fund, it is a little harder to get excited about following your investments when you are not able to see your individual holdings. We find that when our clients hold the individual companies, they are actually engaged in the investment process. Our clients can see the 25 to 35 holdings they own, follow them in the news, and read the annual reports if they so choose. When you hold both ETFs and mutual funds, that excitement and level of monitoring is somewhat lost. Many of our clients will put the stocks they own in their phone and they can easily track the current price, read recent news, and see the dividends from the companies come into the account. We can print out an income report which will show them the number of dividends they are expected to receive in the year ahead. With mutual fund and ETF investing, I find that this engagement element is somewhat lost as everything is wrapped into one structure, making it hard to visualize the underlying holdings. We feel the more engaged any investor is with respect to their investments, the better the long-term results.

When you buy an ETF for your portfolio, you take away a lot of options for yourself. If you need to withdraw funds from your portfolio and you are only holding a Canadian Equity ETF, then you have put yourself in a position with no choice but to sell the ETF to raise funds whether the market is at all-time highs (creating potential capital gains) or at annual lows. With a well–diversified portfolio of individual holdings, you have the ability to pick and choose which holdings to sell given the market conditions at the time when you require funds.

Asset allocation adjustments are always better done when equity markets are at higher levels. With the many market uncertainties listed above, we have increased cash and increased fixed income in the short term (potentially up to 2 years). We have also selected a smaller number of equity holdings. We feel that this strategic adjustment and active approach will help our clients weather the current environment, especially when compared to an equity ETF or index investing strategy.

Goalkeeper Callum Irving, in his first start of the season for Pacific FC, recorded the clean sheet.

It was the first time PFC has opened scoring in the tournament. Diaz’s early goal had the effect of opening up play — PFC had eight shots on target to Valour’s seven — as the Manitoba side was on the back foot early and knew it needed to find a response to Diaz’s quick goal. Irving and the PFC defence, however, was having none of it.

It was a personally notable night for PFC’s Marco Bustos, the Canada-capped striker, who scored seven goals last year for his hometown Valour FC side.

Valour FC is named after a street in Winnipeg, which was renamed Valour in honour of three Victoria Cross recipients in WWI who hailed from it. The Manitoba club is 1-2-1.

It was an emotional day for PFC. Before the game, Pacific head coach Pa-Modou Kah issued an impassioned video plea on OneSoccer for racial equality.

“Take it to heart. I am standing in front of you as manager of Pacific FC. But my heart is bleeding because my people are suffering,” said Kah, who is Black.

“If you care about me, care about my people. Stand up for what is right. Deep down in your heart and your soul, you know what is going on around the world is wrong. Don’t be silent. We need the movement to continue. We need this change. It’s 2020. Educate yourself. Love each other. Treat each other with respect and stand up for what is right. Be the voice for the young generation coming up. You’re part of the change. Don’t go quiet. In every city you are in, jell together, and be as one. Because we’re all humans. People’s lives matter. Black lives matter.”

Soccer supporter groups, meanwhile, are unmatched in their unyielding passion for their clubs, win or lose. CPL supporters groups are following their teams in various fashions across the country. Pacific FC next plays Sunday at 9 a.m. PDT against 2019 league runner-up Cavalry FC of Calgary and Canada-capped former PFC striker Marcus Haber.

Robbie died on Tuesday. He was 71.

He was GM for 11 seasons, building a Victoria team that won eight WLA championships and four Mann Cup Canadian Senior A titles with eight trips to the national final between 1996 and 2006.

Robbie was named WLA executive of the year in 1997 and 2001 and WLA general manager of the year in 2003.

The franchise had not been to the Mann Cup since 1984 when Robbie’s re-engineered Shamrocks finally made it in 1996, losing in four games to the Ontario-champion Six Nations Chiefs. That was just the prelude. The following year, in 1997, the Shamrocks defeated the Niagara Falls Gamblers in five games at the old Memorial Arena on Blanshard Street to capture Victoria’s first Mann Cup since 1983. That was followed by national titles in 1999, 2003 and 2005.

Robbie’s Shamrocks were led in the early part of the era by the legendary Gait twins with Gary named Mann Cup MVP in 1997 and Gary and Paul co-winners in 1999. Other notable players Robbie later brought in — a potent mix of locally-produced players and off-Island recruits that meshed seamlessly — included Lewis Ratcliff, Anthony Cosmo, Andrew Turner, Ryan Ward, Kaleb Toth, Dan Dawson, Ted Jenner, Tyler Heavenor and Ryder Bateman. Robbie was also a key executive with the Gait-led 1988 Minto Cup national Junior A champion Esquimalt Legion and carried through to 1991 at the junior level before resurrecting the Shamrocks at the senior level.

Over the years, Canadian athletes and players on Canadian teams have brought attention to social and political issues with actions on and off the field of play.

article continues below

Here is a look at some notable moments with Canadian connections:

JACKIE ROBINSON

Brooklyn Dodgers president Branch Rickey stood strong behind the first Black player to play in the major leagues, with Robinson breaking the colour barrier at the top level of the sport when he made his debut in 1947. Robinson was named rookie of the year that season.

A year before that, Brooklyn assigned Robinson to the Montreal Royals, its triple-A affiliate. In April 1946, Robinson became the first Black player to play in a minor-league game when Montreal faced Jersey City. The Royals went on to win the International League title that year.

In 2011, U.S. diplomats unveiled a commemorative plaque at the apartment Robinson and his wife Rachel called home in the summer of 1946.

""You can't make (enough) of the house because it's where the experiment started and the experiment went on to be a national success, so it led to something,"" Rachel Robinson said.

""What was nourished there in that house … had widespread influence in our society.""

1980 MOSCOW OLYMPICS

Canada was one of 66 countries to boycott the 1980 Summer Games because of Soviet-Afghan war.

The decision left just 80 countries in the Olympics.

Canada's call didn't sit well with all of the country's athletes. Former pentathlete Diane Jones-Konihowski was critical of the decision.

Jones-Konihowski, a 69-year-old Vancouver native now living in Calgary, doesn't regret her actions.

""I don't... because it (the boycott) was wrong,"" she said. ""We were still trading wheat with Russia, we were still having Aeroflot planes land (in Canada).

""Suddenly we were a priority with the federal government. We'd never been before... and so I was very, very angry.""

CARLOS DELGADO

In protest of American wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the then-Toronto Blue Jays slugger exited the field during the playing of ""God Bless America"" in the seventh inning of games starting in the 2004 season.

There were brief chants of ""USA! USA!"" when he lined out in the top of the seventh at Yankee Stadium during one game in 2004. During a moment of silence before ""God Bless America"" was played during the seventh-inning stretch, derisive shouts were made in his direction.

The native of Puerto Rico started standing for ""God Bless America"" again when he was traded to the New York Mets before the 2006 season.

""I gave him my views on that subject and I also said I would not put myself in front of the team,"" Delgado said. ""The Mets have a policy that everybody should stand for 'God Bless America' and I will be there. I will not cause any distractions to the ballclub.""

PHOENIX SUNS

During a playoff game in 2010, the Suns, led by Victoria's Steve Nash, wore ""Los Suns"" on their jersey.

The decision to wear the jerseys on the Cinco de Mayo holiday came after a law was passed by the Arizona Legislature and signed by Gov. Jan Brewer that drew widespread criticism from Latino organizations and civil rights groups, feeling it could lead to racial profiling of Hispanics.

""I think it’s fantastic,"" Nash said of ""Los Suns.""

""I think the law is very misguided. I think it's, unfortunately, to the detriment of our society and our civil liberties. I think it's very important for us to stand up for things we believe in. As a team and as an organization, we have a lot of love and support for all of our fans. The league is very multicultural. We have players from all over the world, and our Latino community here is very strong and important to us.""

WNBA PROTESTS

All players from the Indiana Fever, inclduing Natalie Achonwa of Guelph, Ont., knelt and locked arms during the anthem before a 2016 playoff game, following similar protests by NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.

This summer, all Seattle Storm and New York Liberty players walked off the court as the national anthem was played before a game. Longtime Canadian national team star Kia Nurse of Hamilton plays for the Liberty.

The WNBA said in a pre-season press release that all aspects of the game and player outfitting would be dedicated to Black Lives Matter and to honour victims of police brutality and racial injustice.

""That's the most important thing about this season, bringing awareness to the injustices that are going on throughout the whole world really, just having these conversations, bringing light to what's going on . . . being leaders in that aspect,"" Minnesota Lynx forward Bridget Carleton of Chatham, Ont., said.

NWSL PROTEST

The first team professional sport to return to the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic made a statement on its opening weekend.

National Women's Soccer League players from the Portland Thorns and North Carolina Courage knelt during the American anthem in late June as the Challenge Cup tournament opened on national television in Utah.

Longtime Canadian national team star Christine Sinclair of Burnaby, B.C., is a member of the Thorns. Goalkeeper Stephanie Labbe plays for the Courage.

""We took a knee today to protest racial injustice, police brutality and systemic racism against Black people and people of colour in America. We love our country and we have taken this opportunity to hold it to a higher standard. It is our duty to demand that the liberties and freedoms this nation was founded upon are extended to everyone,"" the Thorns and Courage said in a joint statement released before the game.

MATT DUMBA

On the opening day of the NHL's restart during the COVID-19 pandemic in Edmonton earlier this month, the Regina-born Dumba made a speech calling for social and racial justice before kneeling for the American anthem prior to an Edmonton Oilers-Chicago Blackhawks game.

""It was to shed light on the people who've lived through injustice and oppression, especially in my home state of Minnesota,"" the Minnesota Wild defenceman said.

Dumba then raised his fist for both the American and Canadian anthems during his team's first game the next day.

A day after that, four players from the Dallas Stars and Vegas Golden Knights knelt for the anthems.

Kaleidoscope Theatre For Young People hit the road Saturday to kick off three weeks of free performances of Gruff, the company’s first touring production in over a decade and the first outdoor performance in its 46-year history.

Four socially-distanced performances for audiences of 40 patrons were held over the weekend at Dominion Brook Park in North Saanich, which served as the de facto kick-off to the company’s in-limbo 2020-21 season. “Right now, we’re using these to test the waters so see what is possible,” said Kaleidoscope Theatre’s executive director, Pat Rundell.

“We haven’t been a touring theatre company in over 10 years, so it’s a chance for us to re-learn and see what’s possible.”

Gruff — a Puente Theatre production commissioned by Kaleidoscope Theatre in 2013 — will be remounted with a pair of hour-long performances at 2 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Filter Beds area of Beaver Lake Park. Additional free performances will be held at the site twice daily through Sunday, followed by additional performances at Ed MacGregor Park in Sooke (Sept. 3) and Government House (Sept. 4-6).

Several months of preparation wet into planning the puppet musical for families directed by Mercedes Bátiz-Benét, who co-wrote Gruff with playwright Judd Palmer. The all-star assembly includes stars Jana Morrison, Trevor Hinton and Rundell, with music by Brooke Maxwell, who co-wrote with Palmer the lyrics about two goats and a troll and the battle for friendship and environmental preservation.

“It has definitely been strange creating theatre in this environment and having to implement new safety protocols, not only for our actors but also our audience. But this show lends itself perfectly to its time as the actors perform in full face masks. They are distanced the entire time.

The musical was not initially part of the company’s 2020-21 season, but was a late addition when all planned Kaleidoscope Theatre shows were postponed when the McPherson Playhouse was shuttered in March.

“If all the stars align, I would love to see a show up by Halloween, if not by Christmas. It’s really exciting to have Kaleidoscope Theatre back in the community. I think there is such a need for entertainment, especially live ent. There has been so much screen time, being able to offer something in person for kids and families is amazing.”

The acclaimed author said he enjoys searching the web for must-see sites of a far-off city, checking out the availability of flights and hotels, and calculating the cost of his travel itinerary.

article continues below

But when it comes time to book, King would rather see the world from the comfort of his home in Guelph, Ont.

""I can have a little espresso at my desk, and look all this stuff up, and it often feels like I've travelled there,"" King, 77, said in a recent phone interview.

""If I don't travel again, I don't know that I'll miss it.""

This weariness of wanderlust animates King's new novel, ""Indians on Vacation,"" which hit shelves Tuesday.

The story follows Canadian couple Mimi and Bird on a peripatetic mission across Europe to recover a family medicine bundle that a long-lost relative absconded with a century earlier.

As they drift from one destination to the next, the two must navigate their conflicting tourist temperaments.

Mimi, with her trusty guidebook in hand, believes that travel is ""broadening."" Meanwhile, Bird, like the book's author, is skeptical that there's much to be gained by straying too far from home.

""When we travel, a lot of times, the thing we come away with is we've been entertained,"" said King.

""I don't know that we feel any differently towards the people that we see on our travels. We find them interesting, sometimes even exotic. And for a moment, perhaps we have a kind of broadening. But I think by the time people get home, that's tightened up again.""

If anything, travel can show that prejudice knows no borders, said King, who was born in the U.S. and is of Greek and Cherokee descent.

From mountain towns to major cities, King said he's often confronted by racist stereotypes of Indigenous Peoples while abroad, including a photographer in France who asked him to pose with a pool stick as if it were a spear.

""What they want is that inauthentic historical image that Hollywood has made up over the years,"" said King.

""It's always the one kind of Indian they've got because the others don't play well visually. Me in a T-shirt and a pair of walking shorts — God forbid anybody see me in walking shorts — that just doesn't do it.""

In writing ""Indians on Vacation,"" King said he wanted to ""play against type"" by depicting Indigenous characters who are well-off enough to travel the world, while still engaging with the historic inequities that have made such portrayals a rarity in popular culture.

As the COVID-19 pandemic has closed down borders, King won't have to endure airplane food, forced photo-ops or guided walking tours any time soon.

But he still longs for a time when he could plan his dream vacation — then decide not to take it of his own accord.

""I don't need to go to Ireland,"" King said. ""But I don't like the fact that I can't.""

By putting Parliament on pause until Sept. 23 and the presentation of a new throne speech, the prime minister has effectively shut down the opposition-dominated committees that were looking into the WE Charity controversy.

article continues below

How big a loss that really is to the opposition parties is debatable.

The latest batch of polls suggests the hit to government fortunes may have started to fade.

For better or for worse, the main players in this saga, from the prime minister on down, have all offered their versions of the events that led to the planned outsourcing of the Canada Student Service Grant to WE Charity.

The most tangible outcome of the controversy so far has been Bill Morneau’s departure from the government. It has undoubtedly accelerated his exit from politics. But in light of the positive reception afforded his successor, Chrystia Freeland, his resignation may turn out to be the opposition’s loss.

In any event, if the WE Charity issue has legs, a parliamentary hiatus will hardly put it to rest.

After Jean Chrétien short-circuited the presentation of the auditor general’s report on the sponsorship program by proroguing Parliament in 2003, the scandal came back months later with a vengeance, poisoning the tenure of his Liberal successor.

As in the case of the sponsorship affair, the Official Opposition can likely count on an officer of Parliament – in this instance, ethics commissioner Mario Dion – to breathe new life into the issue at some point down the line.

Meanwhile though, the momentary suspension of the hostilities on the WE Charity front offers the incoming Conservative leader a much-needed opportunity to start recasting his party. The Liberals are not the only ones who need to change the channel — so does the Official Opposition under its new management.

If the Conservatives are going to have a shot at returning to government, they will have to look and sound less like a pack of attack dogs and more like a government-in-waiting.

On that score, time is almost certainly of the essence. It is not necessary to expect an election this fall to believe that Canada could well go to the polls before the end of next year. If not next month’s throne speech, the presentation of a federal budget in the late fall could pave the way to a winter election.

Whenever the next election does take place, the ballot-box question will almost certainly revolve around who has the best plan to lead Canada through the post-pandemic period.

On that basis, expect the government to draft an agenda and chart a fiscal course that it would be happy to campaign on.

If prosecuting Justin Trudeau and the Liberals was a recipe for electoral success, Andrew Scheer would be about to celebrate his first year as Canada’s prime minister, rather than looking for new accommodations for his family in the nation’s capital.

The approach that did not pay off for the Conservatives in last year’s campaign is even less likely to succeed in the post-pandemic context. Outside the Prairie provinces, the notion that anyone would be a better prime minister than Trudeau has limited traction.

In Canada’s second-largest province, a resurgent Bloc Québécois currently has first call on the non-Liberal vote, with the Conservatives trailing far behind.

If the Conservative party is to improve its standing there, let alone hold on to its current seats, it will have to convince Quebecers that it would offer a better government than the Liberals, not a more strident opposition voice than the BQ.

There has also been a sea change in the Ontario dynamics.

At the time of the last federal campaign, Premier Doug Ford was one of Trudeau’s most vocal provincial critics. Since then, he has become one of Freeland’s biggest fans.

Like his Tory predecessors, Ford has found that having the federal Liberals in power on Parliament Hill is more a blessing than a curse for a provincial government’s political fortunes.

Among the men who led the Official Opposition in the House of Commons over the past 20 years, only Stephen Harper survived an election defeat to go on to lead his party in a second campaign.

As Stockwell Day, Stéphane Dion, Michael Ignatieff, Thomas Mulcair and Scheer can testify, the road from prime-minister-in-waiting to dumped party leader is a short and brutal one.

If the recent past is any indication, Erin O’Toole, chosen Sunday to take the Conservative Party of Canada’s helm, is only guaranteed one shot at unseating the ruling Liberals.

“Because you’re light and flaky?” I say.

“Uh, no. Because it resembles my sleek physique and how in-demand I am.”

“You do realize that the ‘tuna’ we see in restaurants has a fairly high likelihood of being escolar?” I point out. I refer to the 2018 and 2019 surveys of seafood for sale in six Canadian cities by the international, non-profit ocean advocacy group Oceana. The group found that 44 per cent of the seafood samples tested with mislabelled.

Oceana’s surveys and another study by London,Ontario, students found that “albacore tuna” are often switched out for escolar, a kind of mackerel also known as “the laxative of the sea” for the diarrhea, vomiting and nausea it causes in some people. Japan banned escolar in 1977, but it can be sold legally in Canada if it is correctly identified.

Further, Oceana found that all eight downtown Victoria restaurants surveyed sold mislabelled fish. Of the 15 seafood samples collected from the restaurants, 10 were cheaper fish species than those named on the menu. What was sold as “bluefin tuna” was actually yellowfin tuna. “Dungeness crab” was really Atlantic rock crab. “Sockeye salmon” was dressed-up rainbow trout and steelhead salmon. “Cod” was Asian catfish.

“Okay,” Nature Boy changes tack, “then I’m the Perigord truffle. It’s not as exclusive as the white truffle, but it’s still highly desirable… totally fitting, wouldn’t you say?”

“Your totem-food is a fungus?” I say. “A knobbly, old sock–pungent fungus that looks like dirt?”

“The truffle is the King of Fungi,” he preens.

“Yes… but anytime a commodity or product is hugely valuable, people will be ready to dupe the market,” I say. “And truffles are the highest-priced foodstuff around. They sell for thousands of dollars a pound.”

“And your point is…?”

“Well, valuable truffle species are often swapped out by unscrupulous truffle dealers and traders for more plentiful, less aromatic – and considerably less expensive and less desirable – truffles,” I say. “And then there’s truffle oil. This is usually nothing more than oil flavoured with a cheap, possibly carcinogenic, petroleum-derived chemical. That doesn’t help your truffle-totem brand.”

“Right. How about a fine, grassy extra-virgin olive oil then?”

“You’d want to get it tested. Again, the very limited supply can’t meet demand, and there’s great opportunity for faking quality olive oil.”

I mention the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s (CFIA) 2019 campaign against olive oil fraud, triggered by poor weather and insect infestations that damaged the Mediterranean region’s 2018 olive crop. The CFIA runs an International Olive Oil Council-accredited lab Canada and tests olive oils to identify adulterated and mislabelled product. People along the supply chain hoping to make a quick buck have been known to cut real extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) with canola, corn, peanut or tree-nut oil, replace the olive oil altogether with other oils that have been coloured to look like EVOO, or – even harder to trace, because the olive DNA signature remains the same – old, rancid, and therefore less costly olive oil.

Rancid olive oil is so common in North America that many people have come to prefer its flavour over that of the fresh stuff. They’re willing to top price pay for rancid, too.

“Honey?”

“Yes, dear?”

“No,” he says. “What about honey?”

“You’re fine if you’re stick with being a local, small-producer brand. If you go with imported honey from the big supermarkets, you run the risk of being partial honey–corn syrup or –sugar water mix.”

“Well, is nothing safe!” he exclaims.

“I’d avoid sausages, too,” I say.

He scratched his head. “If it looks like a sausage and tastes like a sausage, isn’t it a sausage?”

“The ingredients are often mislabelled. You know, horse meat instead of beef, or beef, pork or – possibly and – chicken when the label says ‘veal.’” Last year, University of Guelph researchers found 14 per cent of sausage samples selected from grocery stores across the country were mislabelled or contained cross-species contamination of meat ingredients. That’s down from a 2017 study that revealed a 20 per cent mislabelling rate.

“So you’re saying we need to be on guard against imitations, decoys, fakes and frauds,” Nature Boy says.

“Just as there are many Nature Boy imitators, there can be but one true Nature Boy.”

“Accept no substitutions!”"

We also have the blue fencing on Pandora and from my (and many of my neighbours’) perspective, the blue fencing is keeping us safe and sane after months of chaos. The city is remediating the Pandora medians (and hopefully checking for contamination) but many of us worry that when the fencing comes down, the tents will go up.

One has only to look at the area in front of Our Place to realize that we are within shouting distance of a repeat performance.

The last paragraph in the article indicates that a city bylaw prohibits overnight camping on the Pandora corridor. However, for some reason, despite our many requests in the past for No Camping signage, there is none.

Even before the COVID disaster, we regularly (apart from the dead of winter) witnessed tents being set up on the Pandora medians, but because the campers typically start setting up after 5 p.m., and bylaw officers don’t work after 5, we have no alternative but to call VicPD, who often have more urgent priorities.

As part of the Pandora remediation effort, the city should erect the signs, but also ensure that their planners engage the neighbourhood in reimagining this beautiful oasis in the city in such a way as to encourage its use by the neighbours and discourage camping. Pandora boulevards and medians are the only green space in Harris “Green.” It should be an attractive and safe area for our residents.

How about a small playground and adult exercise equipment?

Balancing the group sizes

If school children need larger group sizes then the rest of us must simply choose smaller group sizes. That way the various probabilities can still balance out to keep us all safe.

Teachers need to find a way

For many years, the B.C. Teachers’ Federation has fought for smaller class sizes. Good for them. With COVID-19, there have been no classes — zero class size.

Unlike many, teachers are still getting salaries and benefits. They need to find a way to provide a critical service, as other have done. Thankfully, many others have found a way.

Another formidable task for Freeland

Re: “Working mom knows about juggling jobs,” column, Aug. 20.

Yet again another formidable task for Chrystia Freeland: finance minister; as if Foreign Affairs augmented by NAFTA (CMUSA) and deputy prime minister were not enough.

The Liberals will continue to empower Freeland until they find something she cannot handle, and then relegate her to the back benches; say goodbye Bill Morneau!

I am definitely a fan of Chrystia Freeland.

Don’t yell at fellow Canadians

I’m writing because I want to voice my shock and disgust at 2 incidents involving rude remarks and behaviour while my best friend from Alberta was on holiday in Parksville. In both cases they were from my acquaintances. I could almost dismiss the first as it was a one liner after I introduced her. The second I could not dismiss and it really upset both of us. The offender has been witnessed yelling at Alberta plated cars to “go home”. And then she verbally attacked my friend for being here and made us both feel so uncomfortable and unwelcome. We are all concerned but if we do our part to stay safe then we can get through this. If your response is to yell at fellow Canadians and display bad behaviour then I would say this disgusting behaviour makes me wonder what country I’m living in.

Hartland expansion details were withheld

Re: “Hartland Landfill expansion plans rile neighbouring residents,” Aug. 16.

Regarding your story on the Capital Regional District’s plans to expand Hartland Landfill by excavating and quarrying over a number of years, CRD staff are reported to have insisted that “proposed changes were shared with residents” during a transparent consultation process.

Yet the excavation and quarrying that is planned was described in the strategy consultation document only as “enhancing Hartland’s disposal capacity.”

Nowhere did it mention that there would be blasting and quarrying, with 12 trucks per hour removing aggregate on a long-term basis, likely for years, trucking it through neighbouring communities to wherever it will be disposed of.

Nowhere did it mention that the current policy of using all aggregate onsite would be overturned. This process is described in a later document, released after the initial consultations, as creating an “opportunity to use this excess material in CRD projects around the region” since more rock will be mined that can be used onsite.

No mention of how much aggregate will be removed, over how long a period or where it will be shipped. If the CRD has this information, it is not being shared with the public. Instead CRD staff seem to be focused on conducting a public relations exercise that releases as little concrete information on the impact of these proposals as possible.

Appreciation for our PM and premier

We are so lucky here in Canada — and particularly in B.C. — where we have leaders who are doing their best to take care of regular Canadian citizens during the pandemic. In so many other countries, people are left to fend for themselves without any sort of caring or monetary support.

Prime Minister Trudeau has been going out of his way to try to make sure that all citizens are getting the money they need to survive through these unusual circumstances. It makes me very unhappy to see opposition parties not supporting him and doing their best to undermine him and make him look bad. I’m not saying he’s perfect, but he is doing his best to support us all.

He should be getting our encouragement and gratitude rather than having to endure intemperate recriminations from people like Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre. If Poilievre wants to help make things work well, he should make helpful suggestions that could be gratefully acknowledged by the Liberals and then taken into account before final decisions are made. Co-operation among political parties is the only way forward.

In B.C., Premier John Horgan is focusing on providing services to protect health and safety, on giving immediate relief to people and businesses, and on planning for B.C.’s economic recovery over the long term. That’s the right path for our provincial government to be taking and we need to be cheering them on as well.

My best wishes and a heartfelt thank you to both Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Premier John Horgan. We are fortunate to have you in charge.

When I hear it said that our new finance minister is the first “woman” to hold the position or that Kamala Harris is the first “person of colour” to be running for vice-president I cringe.

The key issue is not homelessness

Re: “Homeless people camping at Beacon Hill are mostly from here,” commentary, Aug. 19.

The writers say that numbers in the recent Point In Time study support the notion that “homeless people are mostly from here.” I beg to differ.

The study found 16 per cent of 1,523 respondents were here less than a year. That’s 244 people, a very large homeless camp. Any reasonable person would assume that similar numbers came to Victoria in previous years and as the authors state, less than half of the respondents have lived here more than five years.

The authors claim that these 244 people came here not because they were homeless, but “because family moved here, to be with family or friends, and to find employment.”

Even if this is true, no one should be moving to one of the most expensive cities in the country without the means to support themselves.

On the truth there is complete silence. This issue we have is not “homelessness” at all. The issues are migration, drug and alcohol addiction and mental health issues. No amount of “affordable” housing will change that.

As the authors indicate, “more than 600 people have been housed indoors since the pandemic began.” Many hundreds more have been housed previously. And still, we have about the same number of homeless as we have had for years, and far higher per capita than any other area in the country.

Until these authors and others face up to the true causes of this issue and deal with them, nothing will change. The record speaks for itself.

Raise the drinking age to limit COVID-19

As the major increase in the number of new COVID-19 infections appear to be coming from people in the 20-to-40 age group, and as this appears to be a result of drug- and alcohol-related parties, why not raise the legal drug and alcohol age to say 41 until the curve is flattened once again?

Language is major component of power

Re: “Acceptance of words varies with time,” letter, Aug. 20.

Your correspondent overlooks certain important aspects of the situation she criticizes. First, language is not just about expressing thoughts. It is a major component of power. Power that is exercised through varying degrees of deprivation, oppression, exploitation, discrimination, physical beating, etc., against minorities. Reforming the language used to justify these behaviours is not merely about offending people. It is part of a worldwide struggle for social justice.

Secondly, she shows no respect for people on the receiving end of those forms of power. It is not just “a few academics” who aim to reform this kind of language but also thousands of activists and victims of abuse who want to see members of minorities respected for who they are as human beings.

The letter-writer puts herself on the side of “facts” and logic. Empathy and understanding are required if one wishes to educate oneself about the true nature of her topic.

Re: “Plan for reopening schools ­leaving too many students behind,” comment, Aug. 18.

MLA Sonia Furstenau couldn’t have articulated any better the problem that exists with current return to school plans. Districts must look at offering online options that keep kids connected to their school community.

article continues below

It is wrong to expect families to withdraw from their schools to access distance learning, leaving them with the possibility of losing their spot and separating them entirely from the school community they love.

The emphasis has been placed on return to in-class learning as being essential to students’ mental health, but what has not been taken into consideration is the mental health of students and families who are forced to withdraw because they feel it prudent to distance-learn due to individual health risks.

Those families are falling through the cracks. And let’s be realistic. Fall brings a lot of various viruses, and with the current need for students to remain home if sick, their learning will fall behind unless they can safely access learning online while riding out symptoms from home. A better solution exists, so let’s get moving on putting distance learning into place for the benefit of all students, regardless of their circumstance.

A solution for Ocean Boulevard

As a 50-year taxpaying resident of Colwood, I would like to offer a constructive suggestion regarding Ocean Boulevard.

This has been a roadway and bird sanctuary for all the years I have lived here and seen many improvements made to it, with no one suffering angst regarding it being open for residents to commute.

I remember coming for the day as a child growing up in James Bay, and it was a great family outing, even with no washrooms in those days.

Only during COVID-19, with many coming to our area from surrounding municipalities to walk the open roadway, has there been so much controversy over whether it should be open or closed.

There would be no need for those who wish to walk close to the ocean if there were well constructed boardwalks on each side of the road.

There is a pathway on the inside but someone keeps filling it with rocks, which makes it uncomfortable on the feet. This would make our area unique and welcoming to all, there is room for all of us.

Pondering traffic flow near lagoon

Things are changing rapidly in the Esquimalt Lagoon area of Colwood and the debate concerning Ocean Boulevard as a throughway is once again front and centre.

The car versus caring for nature does not have to be an either-or choice.

The almost unstoppable pressures of increased upstream traffic has already made the Ocean Boulevard a chosen bypass route. This volume is not compatible with recreational or park use. The alternative to closure would probably require another bypass through the Royal Roads and National Defence lands. That’s seemingly doable but both groups are notoriously intransigent.

Could the route continue along the Galloping Goose Trail?

It would be interesting to hear from some planning engineers as to what solutions, if any, are on their drawing boards.

Motor traffic not a problem for birds

It has been suggested that keeping Ocean Boulevard closed to thoroughfare traffic would mean walkers would be free from traffic and the Lagoon bird sanctuary will be protected. However, both thoughts are untrue.

Birds Canada conducted a study of the bird sanctuary during the time the beach and road were closed.

They discovered that it is people, their garbage, plastic, and unleashed dogs that are the problem. The study reported that vehicle traffic is not the issue.

A large section of the road has been left opened to support food trucks. Food trucks attract crowds of people along with their garbage.

Closing a large section of the road has also reduced parking along the beach side of the road. On July 5 at 1:30 pm, I counted 200 cars parked between Lagoon Road and the first barrier, so social distancing was hard to maintain. Traffic has not stopped; it just looks different.

Opening daycare makes sense

Re: “Proposed daycare sparks ­dispute between residential tenants and landlord,” Aug. 16.

Integrating a daycare into the purpose-built rental housing building at Cook and Pandora is sound urban planning and something I hope to see replicated in Victoria, which like the rest of the province is suffering from a crippling daycare shortage.

The fact that some residents have filed a formal complaint, saying that they oppose the “constant stream” of yelling and laughing from the children who are poised to use it, and that this is delaying the project, is truly beyond belief. Let’s get on with this welcome addition to our city. The opponents, since they are paying north of $2,000 a month in rent, can certainly find somewhere else to live, free of such noise and perceived inconvenience.

Speed up testing for COVID-19

The COVID-19 testing system is a mess. I recently required a COVID test and was left in limbo for two days while the system processed my doctor’s referral.

In that period I was overwhelmed with anxiety wondering if I’d succumb before getting the test.

If this virus is so bad, testing must be done immediately to stem the potential panic by those possibly inflicted by the ailment. Waiting is torture.

Furthermore, the system should notify the patient regardless of the test’s result.

No real need for Beacon Hill camping

Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps has finally admitted that “it is not appropriate to have people camping across from an elementary school.”

Does this mean that it is appropriate to have needles, feces, broken windows, vandalism and theft on commercial premises, small businesses, homes and residences?

Furthermore, the commentary by Diana Gibson and Kelly Roth (Aug. 19) about the Point in Time homelessness survey states that 84 per cent of the individuals surveyed on March 11 (before the start of the COVID-19 shutdown) had been in Victoria for more than a year. This means that 16 per cent had not.

The article said that more than 600 people have been housed indoors since the start of the pandemic. Recent reports are that 95 individuals are currently living in Beacon Hill park.

Combining these two numbers is 695 and 16 per cent of 695 is 111, in other words if those 111 individuals had not been drawn to Victoria then there would be no need for anyone to be camping in Beacon Hill Park.

Sadly, contrary to the claim by Gibson and Roth, the data shows that Victoria’s housing and homelessness services are drawing people to the region, have increased demand and have made the situation worse.

Hospital staff: Wear those masks

This past week I have had the unique experience of a two-day medical test. The staff were great overall, and we must be very appreciative of the hard work they provide with a smile.

However, I was more than a little surprised and angry when so many of the people I saw at our largest hospital were not wearing masks. If they were walking down the hallways or in a sheltered area, there were lots of no-masks.

There were lots of no-masks patients and others from security guards to reception staff everywhere.

It is hard enough to try to encourage people to take an active personal responsibility in this crisis time, one would be very hopeful that our medical staff and visitors would take up that responsibility and wear a mask.

There are many “services” and small businesses that have signs on their doors “No Mask, no Service.” I can’t visit my optometrist without a mask and they are showing their responsibility.

Why aren’t hospitals?

Fresh figs and making a new friend

With all the ugliness that’s happening, there is so much good in the world. Today there was a knock on the door. A man standing at the door with a small box in his hand and he introduced himself. He introduced his wife who was standing at the end of the driveway.

They said they were refugees from Syria and had only been in Canada a few months. They were walking by and noticed our fig tree. He said he hasn’t had fresh figs since he was in his homeland. He asked if he could take a couple figs.

I told him to take a few as he had the little box in his hands. I ran out before he left and gave him some peaches.

Shortly afterwards the man came by with two of his sons. He gave us a plate of homemade falafels and hummus made by his wife. The little boys about 8 and 10 years were very curious and asked lots of questions. Akmed asked if my husband would be his dad’s friend. My husband said, “We are already friends.”

He said he’s going to have to get the plate back to them but the man said not to worry, he’ll pop around at some point.

This man could’ve just taken the figs — but he didn’t. And it was so kind to bring a gift in return.

Welcome to Canada. I am grateful every day that my mum moved us to Canada and that we live in one of the safest and most beautiful places in the world.

Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked protests in the city and calls to change the way police deal with people experiencing mental health crises.","TORONTO — Regis Korchinski-Paquet fell to her death while trying to sidestep onto a neighbour's balcony, said a report released Wednesday by Ontario's police watchdog, which concludes there are no grounds to charge officers who were in her home at the time.

The lengthy report from the Special Investigations Unit notes that Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked ""important conversations"" about the ways in which police interact with Black and Indigenous people, but says there was no evidence of police wrongdoing or ""overt"" racism in the incident itself.

article continues below

Director Joseph Martino said race may have been a factor in the events leading up to the death of the 29-year-old, who was both Indigenous and Black, but that examining systemic issues in policing is not his role.

""The task before me was a narrow one — namely, to determine whether there were reasonable grounds, on the evidence collected by the SIU, to believe that any one or more of the officers who responded to Ms. Korchinski-Paquet's apartment committed a criminal offence in connection with her death,"" he wrote.

The Special Investigations Unit said six officers were in the 29-year-old woman's Toronto home when she fell from the balcony in May, while her mother and brother were nearby.

The agency's report says Korchinski-Paquet's mother called police to the home because the two siblings were fighting — ""bottles and punches had been thrown"" — and she wanted both of them removed from the apartment.

It says Korchinski-Paquet and her brother also called 911 during the argument, which began as a dispute over the volume of the TV.

When the 911 operator asked about any mental health issues, the report says, the family indicated that Korchinski-Paquet had epilepsy and had had seizures earlier in the day.

It says that after police arrived, two officers blocked Korchinski-Paquet from getting to her mother and brother before allowing her back into the apartment so she could use the bathroom.

She then went out onto the 24th-floor balcony and prevented officers from joining her by holding her body against the door.

""Very quickly, Ms. Korchinski-Paquet scaled the balcony railing and the (subject officer) lost sight of her,"" the report reads.

She then tried to scale the balcony and cross onto the adjoining one, which is when she lost her balance and fell to her death, the report reads.

The agency said no officers were on the balcony with Korchinski-Paquet at the time, and there's no evidence the officers committed a crime.

Martino said that the officers seemed to be confused about whether epilepsy was a mental health condition and if they should or could detain Korchinski-Paquet under the Mental Health Act.

""The limited layperson's research I have conducted of the matter suggests that epilepsy is a neurological disorder with manifestations that can be mental as well as physical,"" Martino wrote. ""Be that as it may, I cannot fault the officers for failing to take Ms. Korchinski-Paquet into custody prior to her scaling the balcony railing. She had not given them any indication that she wished to harm herself and was professing to be the victim of an assault at the hands of her brother.""

He also said the officers tried to de-escalate the situation between Korchinski-Paquet's family.

The decision comes after the arm's-length agency interviewed all six officers, along with 15 civilian witnesses.

The agency said investigators also received a written statement from Korchinski-Paquet's father, with whom she had been speaking on the phone moments before her death.

Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked protests in the city and calls to change the way police deal with people experiencing mental health crises.

Martino noted that Korchinski-Paquet died just days after George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, was killed when an officer pressed a knee against his neck for nearly nine minutes, at a time when there was increased scrutiny over the relationship between police and racialized people.

In Toronto, thousands of protesters took to the streets on May 30, three days after the incident in Korchinski-Paquet's apartment. Several smaller marches followed it over the next several weeks.

Two city counsellors then brought forward a motion to defund Toronto police, but it was struck down in favour of introducing body-worn cameras to the force.

The Toronto Police Services Board, the body that oversees the force, then launched a series of town halls to discuss systemic racism in policing, though many protesters said such information-gathering had been done before to little effect.

Toronto police and Korchinski-Paquet’s family were expected to comment on the SIU report at separate news conferences later Wednesday.

The federal government had appointed the panel to oversee the implementation of the units as an alternative to solitary confinement for prisoners who pose risks to security or themselves.

Now, the panel no longer exists because the volunteer members' one-year appointments have either expired or will expire within a few weeks.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Ottawa is taking the report seriously and that Public Safety Minister Bill Blair is engaging with the federal corrections service on the issue.

Trudeau says Blair will have more to say about this in the coming days.

Other speakers tonight include senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, who is leaving the White House at the end of the month, and Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn.

A devout Catholic, Pence and wife Karen are expected to carry the evangelical banner into Day 3 of the convention, touting Trump as the best choice for Americans who consider themselves social conservatives.

Democrats seized on the opportunity, deploying the openly gay Pete Buttigieg, one of Joe Biden's former presidential rivals, in a fundraising missive denouncing Pence's ""divisive, anti-LGBTQ politics"" and ""archaic worldview.""

As head of the White House coronavirus force, Pence is also likely to address an issue that has so far received relatively scant attention from convention speakers: the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Tuesday, economic adviser Larry Kudlow spoke of the crisis in the past tense, even though the pandemic continues to rage across the U.S., while only first lady Melania Trump expressed any empathy for the more than 178,000 Americans killed by the virus to date.

""My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one, and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering,"" she said. ""I know many people are anxious, and some feel helpless. I want you to know you are not alone.""

Kudlow, meanwhile, framed the novel coronavirus as ancient history in the U.S.

""It was awful — health and economic impacts were tragic, hardship and heartbreak were everywhere,"" Kudlow said. ""But presidential leadership came swiftly and effectively, with an extraordinary rescue for health and safety to successfully fight the COVID virus.""

Of the racial unrest roiling the country — fuelled this week by another police shooting of an unarmed Black man, this time in Wisconsin — Melania Trump urged protesters to channel their furious energy into positive change, not wanton destruction. She also resisted the urge to ""divide the country further"" by beating up on Democrats.

But she raised eyebrows by framing her husband, notorious for playing fast and loose with the truth, as an honest and authentic human being.

""Total honesty is what we as citizens deserve from our president,"" she said. ""Whether you like it or not, you always know what he's thinking.""

Trump has been putting the power of the presidency under a brazen partisan spotlight, and did so again Tuesday, pardoning a convicted bank robber who now helps prisoners reintegrate into society and presiding over a naturalization ceremony for five new American citizens. His wife's speech was delivered from the White House Rose Garden.

And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's pre-taped speech from a Jerusalem rooftop, coming in the middle of a diplomatic mission, did not escape the attention of some members of Congress. Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is accusing Pompeo of violating federal law by mixing government business with partisan interests.

Authorities implored coastal residents of Texas and Louisiana to evacuate and worried that not enough had fled.

The storm grew nearly 70% in power in just 24 hours to a size the National Hurricane Center called ""extremely dangerous."" Drawing energy from the warm Gulf of Mexico waters, the system was on track to arrive late Wednesday or early Thursday as the most powerful hurricane to strike the U.S. so far this year.

""It looks like it’s in full beast mode,"" said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy. ""Which is not what you want to see if you’re in its way.""

One major Louisiana highway already had standing water as Laura's outer bands moved ashore. Winds began picking up as shoppers rushed into a grocery store in low-lying Delcambre, filling carts with chips and beer. Austin Domingues, 26, said his wife would likely evacuate, but he planned to stay put at his father's farm, where the house is 14 feet off the ground.

""I don’t know if it’s too smart, but we’re going to stay just in case we need to help people out,"" he said.

With time running out, both Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards expressed concerns that not enough coastal residents were taking the dire predictions seriously. In Lake Charles, National Guard members drove school buses around neighbourhoods, offering to pick up families.

Abbott warned that families who do not get out of harm's way could be cut off from help long after the storm makes landfall overnight.

The National Hurricane Center kept raising its estimate of Laura's storm surge, from 10 feet just a couple of days ago to twice that size — a height that forecasters said would be especially deadly.

A Category 4 hurricane can cause damage so catastrophic that power outages may last for months in places, and wide areas could be uninhabitable for weeks or months. The threat of such devastation posed a new disaster-relief challenge for a government already straining to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.

By Wednesday afternoon, Laura had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (225 kph) as it churned about 200 miles (320 kilometres) from Lake Charles, Louisiana, moving northwest at 16 mph (26 kph). Forecasters predict winds will reach at least 145 mph winds but may weaken ever so slightly before landfall.

""Heed the advice of your local authorities. If they tell you to go, go! Your life depends on it today,"" said Joel Cline, tropical program co-ordinator at the National Weather Service. ""It’s a serious day and you need to listen to them.""

On Twitter, President Donald Trump also urged coastal residents to heed local officials. Hurricane warnings were issued from San Luis Pass, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, and reached inland for 200 miles (322 kilometres). Storm surge warnings were in effect from Freeport, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River.

In the largest U.S. evacuation during this pandemic era, more than half a million people were ordered to flee from their homes near the Texas-Louisiana state line, including the Texas cities of Beaumont, Galveston and Port Arthur, and the low-lying Calcasieu and Cameron parishes in southwestern Louisiana, where forecasters said storm surge topped by waves could submerge entire towns.

Edwards lamented that the impending storm meant suspension of community testing for COVID-19 at a crucial time — as elementary and secondary schools in Louisiana are opening and students are returning to college campuses. ""We’re basically going to be blind for this week,"" Edwards said, referring to the lack of testing.

The storm also forced evacuations from an area of the state where there has been a high rate of positive tests.

A National Weather Service meteorologist in Lake Charles, Louisiana — in the bullseye of Laura’s projected path — took to Facebook Live to deliver an urgent warning for people living south of Interstate 10 in southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas.

""Your life will be in immediate and grave danger beginning this evening if you do not evacuate,"" Donald Jones said.

Laura is expected to dump massive rainfall as it moves inland, causing widespread flash flooding in states far from the coast. Flood watches were issued for much of Arkansas, and forecasters said heavy rainfall could arrive by Friday in parts of Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky. Laura is so powerful that it's expected to become a tropical storm again once it reaches the Atlantic Ocean, potentially menacing the Northeast.

Even before dawn Wednesday, officials in Austin said the city had run out of free hotel rooms to offer evacuees and had begun directing families fleeing the storm to a shelter nearly 200 miles farther north. In Texas’ Hardin County, which has more than 57,000 residents along the coast, officials warned that anyone who tried riding out the storm faced days or weeks without electricity.

Becky Clements, 56, evacuated from Lake Charles after hearing that it could suffer a direct hit, almost exactly 15 years after Hurricane Rita destroyed the city. She and her family found an AirBnb hundreds of miles inland.

""The devastation afterward in our town and that whole corner of the state was just awful,"" Clements said. ""Whole communities were washed away, never to exist again. ... So knowing how devastating the storms are, there was no way we were going to stay for this.""

Clements, a church educator, said she fears for her office, which is in a trailer following recent construction.

""I very much anticipate that my office will be gone when I get back. It will be scattered throughout that field.""

The hurricane also threatens a centre of the U.S. energy industry. The government said 84% of Gulf oil production and an estimated 61% of natural gas production were shut down. Nearly 300 platforms have been evacuated. Consumers are unlikely to see big price hikes however, because the pandemic has decimated demand for fuel.

""If Laura moves further west toward Houston, there will be a much bigger gasoline supply problem,"" Oil analyst Andrew Lipow said, since refineries usually take two to three weeks to resume full operations.

Laura closed in on the U.S. after killing nearly two dozen people on the island of Hispaniola, including 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.

Kyle Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, was taken into custody in Illinois on suspicion of first-degree intentional homicide. Antioch is about 15 miles from Kenosha.

Two people were shot to death Tuesday night in an attack carried out by a young white man who was caught on cellphone video opening fire in the middle of the street with a semi-automatic rifle.

""I just killed somebody,"" the gunman could be heard saying at one point during the shooting rampage that erupted just before midnight.

One victim was shot in the head and the other in the chest, Sheriff David Beth told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. A third person suffered gunshot wounds not believed to be life-threatening.

In the wake of the killings, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers authorized 500 members of the National Guard to support local law enforcement around Kenosha, doubling the number of troops sent in. The governor's office said he working other states to bring in additional National Guard troops and law officers.

""We were all chanting ‘Black lives matter’ at the gas station and then we heard, boom, boom, and I told my friend, `‘That’s not fireworks,’"" 19-year-old protester Devin Scott told the Chicago Tribune. ""And then this guy with this huge gun runs by us in the middle of the street and people are yelling, ‘He shot someone! He shot someone!’ And everyone is trying to fight the guy, chasing him and then he started shooting again.""

Scott said he cradled a lifeless victim in his arms, and a woman started performing CPR, but ""I don’t think he made it.""

According to witness accounts and video footage, police apparently let the young man responsible for the shootings walk past them with a rifle over his shoulder as members of the crowd were yelling for him to be arrested because he had shot people.

Much of Rittenhouse’s Facebook page is devoted to praising law enforcement, with references to Blue Lives Matter, a movement that supports police. He also can be seen holding an assault rifle.

Other photographs include those of badges of various law enforcement agencies, including the Chicago Police Department. All of the badges have a black line across them — something police officers do with black tape or another material whenever an officer is killed in the line of duty.

In a photograph posted by his mother, he is wearing what appears to be a blue law enforcement uniform as well as the kind of brimmed hat that state troopers wear.

The sheriff told the Journal Sentinel that armed people had been patrolling the city's streets in recent nights, but he did not know if the gunman was among them.

""They’re a militia,"" Beth said. ""They’re like a vigilante group.""

The FBI said it is assisting in the case.

Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who is Black, said in an interview with the news program ""Democracy Now!"" that the shootings were not surprising and that white militias have been ignored for too long.

""How many times across this country do you see armed gunmen, protesting, walking into state Capitols, and everybody just thinks it’s OK?"" Barnes said. ""People treat that like it’s some kind of normal activity that people are walking around with assault rifles.""

Witness accounts and video show that the shootings took place in two stages: The gunman first shot someone at a car lot, then jogged away, stumbled and fell in the street, and opened fire again as members of the crowd closed in him.

A witness, Julio Rosas, 24, said that when the gunman stumbled, ""two people jumped onto him and there was a struggle for control of his rifle. At that point during the struggle, he just began to fire multiple rounds and that dispersed people near him.""

""The rifle was being jerked around in all directions while it was being fired,"" Rosas said.

Sam Dirks, 22, from Milwaukee, said he had seen the suspected gunman earlier in the evening, and he was yelling at some of the protesters.

""He was definitely very agitated. He was pacing around, just pointing his gun in general. Not necessarily at anyone specifically,"" Dirks said.

In other widely circulating video, police can be seen tossing bottled water from an armoured vehicle to what appear to be armed civilians walking the streets. One of the civilians appears to be the gunman who later shot protesters.

""We appreciate you being here,"" an officer is heard saying to the group over a loudspeaker.

In Wisconsin, it is legal for people 18 and over to openly carry a gun, with no license required.

Blake, 29, was shot, apparently in the back, on Sunday as he leaned into his SUV, three of his children seated inside. Kenosha police have said little about what happened other than that they were responding to a domestic dispute. They have not said why the officers opened fire or whether Blake was armed, and they have not disclosed the race of three officers on the scene.

On Tuesday, Ben Crump, the lawyer for Blake’s family, said it would ""take a miracle"" for Blake to walk again. He called for the officer who opened fire to be arrested and for the others involved to lose their jobs.

The shooting was captured on cellphone video and ignited new protests in the U.S. three months after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer touched off a nationwide reckoning over racial injustice.

During the unrest in Kenosha since then, protesters destroyed dozens of buildings, set fires and hurled objects at police, who responded with tear gas on three straight nights.

The legal team representing Const. Michael Theriault has filed an application to vacate the verdict, arguing the conviction for assault was not available to the court.

article continues below

Theriault and his brother, Christian Theriault, were charged with aggravated assault and obstruction of justice in relation to a December 2016 incident that left Dafonte Miller with a ruptured eye and other serious injuries.

In a ruling delivered in June, Ontario Superior Court Justice Joseph Di Luca said he could not rule out the possibility that self-defence played a role in the early portion of the encounter.

It was during that period that Miller sustained the eye injury that warranted the aggravated assault charge, he said.

However, Di Luca said the self-defence argument collapsed when Theriault later armed himself with a roughly metre-long pipe and hit Miller in the head as the then-19-year-old was retreating.

As a result, Theriault was acquitted of aggravated assault but convicted of the lesser charge of assault.

The officer was also acquitted on the obstruction of justice charge, and his brother was cleared on all counts.

Theriault's lawyers argue in court documents that assault was not listed as an option on the indictment and should not have been available for a guilty verdict.

Theriault was ""never on notice"" that he was being tried for ""assaultive conduct"" not connected to the eye injury, the document says.

""Given that there was no jurisdiction on this indictment to find the applicant guilty of an assault that was not charged and was not included in the counts on the indictment, it is appropriate for the court to grant this application and vacate the finding of guilt,"" the application states.

The Crown is also challenging the verdict, which was delivered amid ongoing protests against systemic racism and calls to defund the police.

In a notice of appeal filed late last month, prosecutors allege Di Luca ""erred in his analysis and assessment of the defence of self-defence.""

The case sparked multiple demonstrations, and many have denounced the ruling as further proof of anti-Black discrimination in law enforcement and the justice system.

Prosecutors alleged the Theriault brothers chased Miller in the early hours of Dec. 28, 2016, cornered him between two homes in Whitby, Ont., and beat him with a pipe because they wanted to deliver street justice.

The defence argued their clients caught Miller and his friends breaking into the Theriault family truck and wanted to arrest him. They said the two men found themselves fighting for their lives when Miller, who they said was armed with a pipe, attacked.

Di Luca flagged credibility issues with multiple witnesses, including the Theriault brothers and Miller. He found that Miller and his friends were stealing items from cars and that Michael Theriault's initial intention was ""likely not to arrest Mr. Miller, but rather to capture him and assault him.""

Miller was arrested by Durham regional police officers who arrived at the scene, though the charges against him were later dropped. The brothers were charged in the summer of 2017, months after the incident took place.

Toronto police said Wednesday that Theriault remains suspended with pay, and that any potential disciplinary action would take place once the court case is concluded.

Earlier this month, an independent review of the Toronto force's handling of the incident found its former chief, Mark Saunders, breached the Police Services Act by not reporting the incident to the province's police watchdog.

The report also found, however, that Saunders was kept in the dark about the incident for five months.

The force's interim chief, James Ramer, issued an apology for the department's decision not to immediately notify the Special Investigations Unit.

Miller dismissed the apology as a ""public relations exercise,"" and said in a statement that neither he nor his lawyers were notified of the review's findings until minutes before their release.

RCMP in Nova Scotia issued a localized emergency alert a week after the 14-year-old girl went missing with a 47-year-old man she knew. That man was arraigned Monday on one count of child abduction.

Police have said they did not issue an Amber Alert because they thought the teenager left with him willingly. They now say new evidence indicates she had been abducted.

Lorraine Whitman, president of the Native Women's Association of Canada, said Wednesday it's a relief the girl from We'koqma'q Mi'kmaq First Nation was found safe, but the case highlights a national problem.

She pointed to the report from the public inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, which highlighted a pattern of police categorizing missing girls as runaways, slowing down investigations.

Whitman says the ""runaway"" stereotype puts underage girls in danger and criteria for alerts should be reviewed to prevent the same delays from affecting another minor.

""They may have ran away, but we have to look at it more in depth,"" she said in an interview. ""We just can't take it as a case that they wanted to leave. We have to look into it because there are more underlying areas that we have to investigate as well.""

The 2019 report on missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls cited testimony from families who ""shared how stereotypes and victim blaming served to slow down or to impede investigations into their loved ones' disappearances or deaths.""

""The assumptions tied to Indigenous women, girls ... by police as 'drunks,' 'runaways out partying,' or 'prostitutes unworthy of follow-up' characterized many interactions, and contributed to an even greater loss of trust in the police and in related agencies,"" the report said.

Whitman also took issue with the RCMP's statement that the girl left willingly from her foster home with the man she knew. She said a 14-year-old can't make that decision on her own, and suggested that if a non-Indigenous, wealthier child had been involved, the alert would have been sent right away.

""This is almost a week after this young girl has been missing, and in the woods,"" Whitman said. ""Our lives are very important as well. She was a minor and the RCMP had a due diligence that they had to follow.""

Video surveillance footage placed the 14-year-old and the man at a gas station in Catalone, N.S., on Aug. 13. Before she was found on Aug. 24, community members had been searching the area and pressuring police for more urgency in finding her and to issue an Amber Alert.

The We'koqma'q chief and council had offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to her whereabouts. Police issued a localized alert to residents east of the Mira River in Cape Breton a week after the girl ran away.

According to the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, Amber Alert programs are provincially operated and only the police can issue them. The criteria for issuing them vary, but the basic requirements include the disappearance of someone under the age of 18 who is suspected of being abducted.

RCMP Cpl. Lisa Croteau said Wednesday that information before the girl was found indicated she had not been abducted. New evidence, however, supports the child abduction charge, she said. Croteau said she could not go into specifics about the evidence because the case is before the courts.

But Croteau said police did not consider an Amber Alert necessary, because they did not believe the man was on the run with the child.

""From the onset of this investigation, we had strong evidence that they still were camping in the Cape Breton area and that they did not intend to leave the island,"" Croteau said.

She cited ongoing talks with the provincial government about the general protocols for sending public alerts to Nova Scotia residents, adding that it's not within the police's power to change them.

Those consultations follow criticism that a provincewide emergency alert was not sent on April 18-19, during the manhunt for a killer who claimed 22 lives in the province. Police were chasing a gunman who was dressed as a Mountie during parts of his rampage.

When asked if the Nova Scotia RCMP detachment would take a closer look at how it approaches cases involving missing Indigenous kids, Croteau said the force treats all missing person cases seriously regardless of race.

Champagne raised the cases of former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor on Tuesday during a meeting with Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Rome, which the Canadian minister is visiting as part of a multi-country tour.

The two Michaels were arrested in apparent retaliation shortly after Canadian authorities in Vancouver detained Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei. She is wanted in the United States on fraud charges.

Meng, who has denied any wrongdoing, is now facing possible extradition to the U.S. while Chinese authorities have indicted the detained Canadians on what many observers believe are trumped-up spying charges.

""I would like to stress once again that things between China and Canada have come to this stage not because of China,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said during a news conference in Beijing on Wednesday.

""The Canadian side is well aware of the crux of the problem. It should take immediate and effective measures to correct the mistakes and create conditions for bilateral relations to return to the right track.""

The comments appear to pour cold water on hopes that Champagne's meeting with Wang in Rome would lead to a breakthrough for the two Michaels.

A summary of the ministers' meeting released by Global Affairs Canada said the two discussed the importance of global co-operation in dealing with COVID-19, including when it comes to developing and rolling out a vaccine.

""Minister Champagne again reiterated that the cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor remain a top priority for the Government of Canada and that Canada continues to call on China to immediately release both men,"" the department added.

Champagne was also said to have asked for clemency for all Canadians sentenced to death in the country. Four Canadians found guilty of drug charges have been sentenced to death since Meng was arrested in December 2018.

Global Affairs Canada repeated past calls for immediate consular access to the two Michaels, who have not been allowed to see Canadian officials since January. The department has accused China of violating international law.

The back and forth follows calls from former Canadian politicians and ambassadors for the federal Liberal government to intervene in the extradition process and free Meng to secure the release of Kovrig and Spavor.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said doing so would encourage more countries to arbitrarily arrest Canadians to put pressure on Ottawa for their own interests.

Meng's legal team recently suffered a defeat in its bid to stop extradition proceedings against their client as a federal court judge rejected their requests for the contents of six confidential documents to be released.

Justice Catherine Kane's Aug. 21 ruling, made public on Tuesday, found the information contained in the documents was not relevant to the allegations of abuse described by Meng's legal team.

Kane added that the attorney general of Canada and a friend of the court submitted a joint proposal that included the lifting of some redactions, but they agreed disclosing the remainder would hurt national security or international relations.

The friend of the court is a lawyer with security clearance who was appointed to view the documents and advise Meng's team on whether any were worthy of dispute, but he was not allowed to share their contents.

Fifty-seven women, including 18 Canadians, have joined the lawsuit, which alleges that Peter Nygard used violence, intimidation, bribery and company employees to lure victims and avoid accountability for decades.

Last Friday, the judge presiding over the case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York stayed court proceedings until further notice.

Court records show the judge's order was sealed and access to information about why there was a stay has been restricted.

The sealing order prevents lawyers from commenting on why the case was stayed.

However, before the order was sealed, the court docket said the stay resulted from a government motion and named three federal prosecutors.

It also said the government would be required to inform the court when its proceedings were complete so the stay could be lifted.

The Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York did not respond to a request for comment.

Nygard has denied all allegations and blames a conspiracy caused by a feud with his billionaire neighbour in the Bahamas. He stepped down as chairman of his company after the FBI and police in New York City raided his offices in February.

In court filings last month, Nygard argued the New York court does not have jurisdiction to hear the lawsuit.

The original lawsuit against Nygard, 79, included allegations from 10 women who accused him of enticing them to his estate in the Bahamas. In the following months, more women from Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States have continued to add their names to the lawsuit.

The women, who are not named, share stories in court documents about being brought to Nygard's offices and properties with promises of modelling or other career opportunities. Some allege they were given alcohol spiked with drugs before they were sexually assaulted.

Two women allege they were as young as 14.

The women are asking for a trial by jury and are seeking yet-to-be determined damages.

Two of Nygard's sons filed a separate lawsuit against their father earlier this month claiming they were statutorily raped at his direction when they were teenagers. The sons say Nygard arranged for a woman to have sex with them.

That lawsuit alleges Nygard's sexual predation is an ""open secret"" at Nygard's companies.

The majority of that amount will go to about 1.67 million people in payments of up to $600, which the Liberals say are aimed at offsetting any extra costs linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The total cost should hit federal books this year, but the budget office warns there may be potential fiscal impacts in subsequent years.

The first legislative push to provide the special payments failed in June when the minority Liberal government couldn't gain opposition support for a wider spending bill.

A few weeks later, a compromise was struck whereby the Liberals expanded eligibility for the payments to also include veterans.

Payments will max out at $600, drop to $300 for any recipients who receive old age security benefits, and fall to $100 for low-income seniors who receive OAS and the guaranteed income supplement.

The report from the budget watchdog Wednesday notes its estimate on the number of people eligible to receive the payments could be thrown off a bit by a separate part of the federal response to the pandemic.

That is because one of the requirements for payments is to be eligible for the disability tax credit, or having applied for the credit by Sept. 25.

The PBO report says the government's extension for filing personal income tax returns could reduce the rate at which people recertify for the credit, but calls it a minor source of uncertainty.

The budget office has been independently tracking federal spending through the pandemic to provide its own analysis over the accuracy of government projections.

It updated one of those projections this week in regarding to a special paid leave for federal employees, known as pay code 699.

The policy gives federal workers paid time off for emergencies such as having to quarantine with COVID-19 or to care for children or other dependants, and doesn't require them to use up vacation or sick days first.

Adding in data from June, the budget office estimates that paid leave has cost the government $828 million since March, inclusive of pension and other benefits. That works out to an average of $3,430 per worker who accessed the leave over that time.

The figures also include estimates for departments that haven't provided data to the budget office.

The report says the number of hours claimed under the policy is ""almost certainly an underestimation of the loss of work hours due to the pandemic.""

Use of the policy has dropped from a peak of 72,700 federal workers in April to just over 43,300 in June, the PBO says. The Canada Revenue Agency continues to have the largest share of workers using the leave.

""The Canada Revenue Agency was able to continue many of its core operations despite claiming by far the most hours of 699 leave. This is due to a strong culture of monitoring time spent on specific activities,"" the budget office wrote on its website.

""It is therefore highly likely that other federal organizations not completing core operating functions like meeting legislated timelines for access-to-information requests are severely under-reporting the extent of hours of work lost due to the pandemic.""

He said he can not provide details at this time.

“We expect to have more information available withing the new few weeks.”

The company has been ­working to introduce the service for years. In 2019, Marshall said the the company had lost an investor, resulting in a delay. He predicted then that would happen in 2020 at the earliest. The company had previously said in 2014 and 2017 that the ferry was imminent.

Kim Smythe, chief executive of the Greater Nanaimo Chamber of Commerce, said he has heard that there are a couple of new proponents that may be interested in running a foot-passenger service. He was not given the name of possible ferry operators.

Every election, candidates announce their support for a walk-on service between the cities, seeing it as a desired link for business and individuals. But the idea does not make financial sense to B.C. Ferries.

At B.C. Ferries’ recent annual general meeting, chief executive Mark Collins said the company has “no plans for passenger vessel services.”

Collins, who was responding to a question from a member of the public, said the company operates under the terms of the Coastal Ferry Services contract it has with the province.

“That contract does not specify us to provide such a service,” he said.

“The contract does not prohibit us from going over the contract, of course, and it is possible for the company to introduce new routes.”

B.C. Ferries only brings in new routes when it benefits ferry users, he said.

The current analysis shows that a Nanaimo-Vancouver walk-on route would not be a viable business, Collins said.

“To date, although we have looked at it several times, we see no combination of financial and operational circumstances which would be of benefit to the ferry system,” he said.

“Rather, we see most of these ferry services would be a significant loss-making venture and we do not see that presently as a benefit to ferry users.”

B.C. Ferries is facing a drop in ridership and millions of dollars in lost revenue as a result of the pandemic and has postponed major capital investment.

Two B.C. Ferries routes connect Nanaimo and the Lower Mainland. One runs out of Departure Bay and the other from Duke Point, connecting with Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver and Tsawwassen, respectively. Each offers walk-on and vehicle service.

Tailored Brands, which also owns Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank stores, said over the weekend it will continue to operate most stores during restructuring and expected to reduce its funded debt by $630 million.

COVID-19 restrictions have severely limited weddings and office work since March, hitting the clothing retail and rental sectors particularly hard.

The three Island stores — including Nanaimo’s Brook’s Landing Mall and Westshore Town Centre in Langford — were shut down in March and reopened with reduced staff in late June.

Lawrence Larsen, manager of the Uptown store, said the three Island locations will continue to operate.

At least two stores — both in Surrey — have not reopened.

Larsen said the Uptown location is operating without 40 per cent of its usual staff.

He said sales since reopening have been “consistent, but overall the business is really down” from previous years.

Dinesh Lathi, chief executive of Tailored Brands, said in a statement to clients over the weekend the pandemic has altered the way people live and work.

“It means fewer in-person meetings, wedding celebrations and special events. Simply put, people are staying home more, and our clothes are better suited to being out and about,” Lathi said.

He said the company is “making major shifts” by creating a leaner structure to adapt to the realities of today’s retail environment.

“In July, we announced some store closures. However, we will continue to have stores across Canada operating as usual. Nothing about our decision to seek Chapter 11 protection changes that.”

Meanwhile, Lord & Taylor, the oldest retailer in the U.S., also said it was seeking bankruptcy protection over the weekend, lengthening the list of major retail chains that have faltered during the pandemic.

Household names, many longtime anchors in malls, were already struggling to keep up with consumers moving to online sales.

Lord & Taylor, which began as a Manhattan dry goods store in 1824, was sold to the French rental clothing company Le Tote Inc. last year. Both filed for bankruptcy protection, separately, on Sunday.

Lord & Taylor says it’s looking for a buyer.

Tailored Brands was struggling even before the pandemic lockdowns smothered any demand for suits or ties.

It wasn’t alone.

Last month, Brooks Brothers, the 200-year-old company that dressed nearly every U.S. president, filed for bankruptcy protection. Its rival, Barneys New York, is being dismantled after filing for bankruptcy last year.

Dozens of retailers, big and small, have filed for U.S. Chapter 11 protection this year. The pace through the first half of 2020 far exceeds the number of retail bankruptcies for all of last year. About two dozen U.S.-based chains have sought bankruptcy protection since the pandemic started.

Others include J. Crew, J.C. Penney, Neiman Marcus, Stage Stores, and Ascena Retail Group, which owns Lane Bryant in addition to Ann Taylor.

Loblaw Companies Ltd., which began offering COVID-19 testing for patients at a handful of its Alberta pharmacy locations in June, plans to expand the program to all 234 of its pharmacies in the province by Sept. 1.

The company says it has reached out to all 10 provinces to discuss in-store testing outside Alberta, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford this week acknowledging the possibility.

The swab tests are only for those with no symptoms or any known contact with coronavirus patients and may be useful for teachers returning to school or Canadians who take care of an older family member, said Theresa Firestone, head of health and wellness at Shoppers Drug Mart. Loblaw-owned pharmacy locations include Shoppers stores as well as Independent Foods and No Frills.

""It's very convenient. We're in every community. The other plus is they don't have to line up with people who may have symptoms. We've shared that with Ontario and with other provinces, so at this point we’re looking forward to what they may decide,"" Firestone said.

London Drugs also conducts COVID-19 tests in Alberta. It began offering the service at six locations during the past two weeks and plans to roll it out at nine more by October. Like Shoppers, it bills Alberta Health Services for testing costs.

The service builds on other responses to the pandemic such as online pharmacist consultations and a pilot program where patients consult virtually with doctors in a private room in the store.

London Drugs is among the pharmacy retailers beefing up their role in a health-care system grappling with an aging population.

""With the extended hours of operation, you can basically go in when our stores are open and be able to find a pharmacist to ask a question. So what we’re able to do at that point is basically help triage the system,"" said Chris Chiew, head of pharmacy at the Richmond, B.C.-based retailer.

London Drugs has also hired diabetes educators to test blood sugar levels and assist patients with weight management and diet.

Shoppers has stepped even further into the realm of physicians, opening one of three planned medical clinics with doctors who cater to a roster of patients and walk-in services.

""There are a number of Canadians who don’t have access to a family physician. And we thought there was an opportunity for us to really play a role here in terms of access,"" Firestone said.

Drugstores can also handle the bureaucratic side of health care, freeing up doctors to spend more time with patients, she said.

""Looking for PPE (personal protective equipment), sorting out their waiting rooms so that people are socially distanced, managing virtual care...we’re able to take that burden on for them,"" Firestone said.

In 2018, Shoppers launched its Wellwise store chain to sell assisted-living devices aimed at older Canadians. More recently, it began to offer tips and videos online designed to help ward off depression and anxiety.

Metro Inc. declined to comment on any attempts to provide COVID-19 testing. The bulk of the company's Jean Coutu drugstores are located in Quebec, which unlike some provinces does not allow pharmacists to conduct testing via nose and mouth swabs.

In a statement, one unnamed Starbucks worker, said the staff were sick of “being paid minimum wage to work for a multibillion-dollar company, being understaffed during a global pandemic, and we don’t like decisions that directly affect our safety being made without us.”

Steve Hunt, the Western Canada director of the Steelworkers, said the staff started organizing electronically about one month ago, driven by concerns raised about health and safety during the pandemic.

“Everyone is concerned about their health and there were some issues here,” he said.

“It’s an interesting thing — we can’t organize if people are treated with dignity and respect. There are obviously some problems and we, hopefully, can work with the employer.”

In a statement, Starbucks said it prides itself on open and direct communication with its staff.

“And while we are disappointed with this result and respect the free choice of our partners to affiliate with unions, we believe a direct relationship with partners is the best way to create and maintain a great work environment,” the company said.

Hunt said Starbucks is not a typical marriage for the union, given the Steelworkers represent 50,000 workers in Western Canada, many of them forest workers, but the union has made itself available during the pandemic based on demand.

“We are getting calls from all over right now because of COVID-19,” he said, adding hospitality industry workers have a tough job being on the frontline during a pandemic.

Hunt said organizing a Starbucks staff is not normally what the union would do, but it has developed a position through the pandemic that essential workers doesn’t mean sacrificial.

“They needed a union and we are happy to represent them,” he said.

Hunt said the coffee shop’s staff likely sought the Steelworkers out because the union is known for its backbone.

“They probably looked around and we are well known,” he said. “We don’t go looking for a fight, but we don’t back down either. I think it was as simple as that.”

“Workers from all sectors are reaching out to unions for safety, decent wages and a voice in their workplaces, especially during the pandemic,” said Hunt.

“Workers are told they are essential, but they don’t have the wages or safety protections that should back that claim up.”

Hunt said the next step is to establish a bargaining committee among the workers, get some members active in the union and offer training, then contact the company about bargaining sessions.

“We’re really excited about it,” said Murphy. “The Peninsula is growing, younger families are coming out here and the key thing is our farm is out there as are many of our suppliers and growers, so we’re delighted to be out there and closer to them.”

He also noted they love the location. “We like the Pier Hotel to start with. It is a great property and that is a stunning piece of waterfront It’s a great spot and to be part of the hotel we think it’s an outstanding fit for us to be able to join them.”

The 140-seat dining room will be closed for just over two months as it undergoes renovations to the dining room and modifications to the kitchen.

Murphy said they intend to warm up the room by using more wood decor and adding fireplaces. There are also plans for a large bar that will include an oyster shucking ceviche stations.

Murphy said the 30 staff that will be affected by the closure will likely be offered positions with the new restaurant, and may not be off work for long.

He said between the farm, which will be planting a large orchard in February, construction at the new restaurant and his two downtown restaurants, there will be a spot for them.

The cafe at the hotel will remain open; 10 Acres will take over that spot as of March 15."

Five Victoria entrepreneurs say despite the pandemic, there’s no time like the present to open a new store dedicated to the delectable treat.

“In times of recession, people always buy what they like,” partner David Booth said.

He and his wife, Vlasta, have been making TerribleTruffles for more than a decade. They have joined David Mincey, of The Chocolate Project, and Heidi Lalonde and Stephanie Sketchley, of Uncouth Chocolate, in a new retail operation in downtown Victoria.

Chocolat & Co., which opened Saturday at 703 Fort St., is a collective of the vanguard of chocolate producers in Victoria who are sourcing cacao beans from around the world and “obsessing” with roasting, refining and creating chocolate treats and drinks.

“We live and breathe chocolate, all of us,” Booth said. “It’s our passion.”

Mincey, who operated Camille’s restaurant in Bastion Square for years, has been sourcing cacao beans for two decades from farmers in Peru, Papua New Guinea and Madagascar, rather than large industrial wholesalers in Europe.

He created The Chocolate Project to trace the source of cacao beans, right down to the farm and type of tree.

Mincey is now considered one of Canada’s leading experts on chocolate, lecturing on the bean-to-bar process across North America and leading a course at the University of Victoria.

The Chocolate Project, which opened in The Public Market in the Hudson building in 2014, has created more than 350 different bars of chocolate from 60 artisan makers and inspired a new wave in the foodie movement, including Lalonde and Sketchley who launched their business after working with Mincey.

Mincey said Victoria is now considered the chocolate mecca in Canada and one of the leading producers of artisan chocolates in North America.

“I can tell you we definitely have a rabid fan base for chocolate in this town,” Mincey said. “People not only love chocolate, but they love to know where it comes from. We’ve created a library and tasting it is like a journey to an exotic country.”

Mincey said the new venture on Fort Street brings together “a cool mix of different talents.”

David Booth earned his Red Seal certification in pastries in 1992, and began making chocolate truffles at a family-run bed and breakfast. In 2016, the Booths bought the Birdcage Confectionery in James Bay, where a corner is stocked with their Terrible Truffles-branded chocolates.

“Opening a store that is dedicated to chocolate is a dream come true. I’ve always pictured myself with a chocolate shop and a lineup out the door,” he said.

Lalonde and Sketchley have been making bean-to-bar chocolate for the past six years.

The new store will be a permanent home for the pair, who have been selling at farmer’s markets and craft fairs.

Sketchley, a former archeologist and sustainability co-ordinator with Mountain Equipment Co-op, said customers can expect everything from single-origin chocolate bars and baking to truffles, bon bons with fruit and creme and caramel fillings, and hot and cold chocolate drinks.

Chocolat & Co.’s location, near the Royal Bank at the corner of Douglas and Fort streets, has been home to a chocolate shop for nearly 15 years. The Pappas family ran a store there and sold it last September, but the new owners shuttered the store as the pandemic hit.

Mincey said consumers seem very willing to support small businesses. He said sales at The Chocolate Project dipped considerably early in the pandemic, but have since climbed to levels before the virus hit.

Jeff Bray, executive director of the Downtown Victoria Business Association, said it’s encouraging to see Chocolat & Co. open a new venture during a difficult economic times.

“I think it’s a reminder that we should support local businesses,” Bray said.

He said although some stores and restaurants are showing improvements in sales and traffic, it isn’t near the levels needed to keep everybody afloat.

Bray said with the U.S. border closed and tourism at all-time lows, the key for survival for most downtown businesses right now is the return of government workers and others to offices.

“Come September, we need office workers back or more people to make purposeful decision to shop downtown. If not, there will be significant business closures.”

The Canadian Association of Broadcasters issued a report on Wednesday warning of potential closures and widespread job cuts as private TV and radio broadcasters face a cumulative projected revenue shortfall of up to $1.06 billion by the end of 2022.

Most vulnerable are the country's AM radio stations, the report said, as well as other independent private radio and TV operations in smaller markets across the country.

The study, titled ""The Crisis in Canadian Media and the Future of Local Broadcasting,"" was commissioned by the CAB, which represents the majority of private broadcasters in Canada, and conducted through Winnipeg-based independent media economics consultancy Communications Management Inc.

The CAB says it's concerned about the fallout from a substantial erosion in local advertising revenues over recent months.

Radio stations may be hardest hit in the short term, the report suggests, partly due to many advertisers pulling back on their spending in the pandemic and hastening a decline in the media industry's revenues.

Private radio ad revenues are expected to be $383 million below last year, it said.

The report's projections suggest that without further government support those declines could mean as many as 50 private local radio stations go out of business over the next four to six months.

Another 150 radio stations could topple in the 18 months that follow, it said, leading to as many as 2,000 job losses.

TV stations could risk a similar fate with roughly 40 of Canada's 94 private TV broadcasters in danger of closing within one to three years, the research predicts.

The CAB is calling on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to take swift action by establishing a ""more fair and sustainable future"" for local media.

Last month, the organization sent an emergency application to the CRTC requesting permission for broadcasters to be relieved of certain terms of their agreements, such as spending requirements on Canadian programming, for the broadcast year that ends Aug. 31.

Lenore Gibson, chair of the CAB, said broadcasters have ""done their utmost to cut expenses"" in areas such as administration, and ""the last thing that they want to do is cut into programming costs, but that's the only area that's left now.""

The CAB is urging the federal government to provide emergency regulatory relief as well as greater ""targeted support"" for the industry starting this fall.

Without greater financial measures in place, the CAB says the effects could leave many communities with only national and international media organizations to provide them with most of their news, effectively eliminating most community coverage of local politics, health and education in some regions of the country.

Premier Baseball League players Nick Pivetta of the Eagles, Rich Harden, Michael Saunders of the Mariners, James Paxton, Tyler O’Neill, Larry Walker, Ryan Dempster, Jeff Francis, Brett Lawrie, Adam Loewen and Justin Morneau played.

These Mariners and Eagles players were not in the dugouts like the old days but more widely spaced outside them. Parents and grand-parents were not allowed in the stands but were socially distanced in family pods around the field on lawn chairs. A new ball had to be brought in every time after the previous one was put into play.

But the players were on the diamond playing the game they love, and had been deprived of, and that’s all that mattered as Phase 3 of the B.C. return to sport has begun.

The third phase allows for games between associations on a regional basis. The annual Zack Downey Memorial Tournament between the Mariners, Eagles and fellow-BCPBL teams Parksville Royals and Mid-Island Pirates of Nanaimo is scheduled for Layritz Park from Sept. 18 to 21.

“I know athletes and their families have been missing the joy of competition these past few months,” Lisa Beare, provincial minister of tourism, arts and culture and minister responsible for sports, said in a statement Monday.

Phase 3 also opens the gate for the Island Cup preseason B.C. Hockey League tournament featuring the Victoria Grizzlies, Cowichan Valley Capitals, Nanaimo Clippers, Alberni Valley Bulldogs and Powell River Kings beginning Oct. 2 and ahead of the BCHL’s anticipated season opening Dec. 1. Similar respective regional or “cohort” BCHL exhibition tournaments are planned for the Lower Mainland and also Interior teams.

“It’s exciting to know we will be having preseason games through the fall in what will be an extended training camp,” said Grizzlies GM and head coach Craig Didmon, in welcoming the announcement of Phase 3.

“It’s important for player development.”

But Phase 3 is no consolation for the Western Lacrosse Association’s Victoria Shamrocks and Nanaimo Timbermen, West Coast League baseball’s Victoria HarbourCats or B.C. junior football’s Westshore Rebels and V.I. Raiders, whose 2020 seasons were cancelled due to COVID19. The Victoria Royals lost the 2020 Western Hockey League playoffs but at least have a tentative 2020-21 season start date of Dec. 4 and the numerous Island-based Olympians have Tokyo 2020 plus one next summer.

There are still pandemic guidelines to be followed as sport opens wider in Phase 3.

“And everyone is taking them seriously,” said Mike Chewpoy, head coach of baseball’s Victoria Mariners of the BCPBL.

“Nobody wants to take the chance of being shut down again because they didn’t follow the rules. It’s not hard, just different. We normally go through a dozen and a half balls in doubleheaders. Now we go through four dozen balls. But the guys are just happy to be out there playing after having baseball taken away from them for most of the season.”

The B.C. Centre for Disease Control has reviewed viaSport’s return to sport guidelines for Phase 3. ViaSport is a not-for-profit organization, created with the support of the provincial government in 2011, to help guide and build sport in the province. Its Phase 3 protocols address regional cohort teams and competitions, travel, high-performance training for the likes of the Olympians based in Victoria, Richmond and Whistler, and run-of-game aspects such as physical contact.

“These guidelines will enable the social and emotional benefits of sport while ensuring the sports activities remain as safe as possible,” said B.C. health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry.

Phase 3 is considered the lynchpin stage to eventual return to normal play, whenever that will be, and has been long awaited throughout this summer by those in sports.

“Now, as we enter Phase 3, we will start to see more sport activities in communities around the province,” said Charlene Krepiakevich, CEO of viaSport.

“While these guidelines offer key parameters for the increase in sport activity, each sport will advance at a different pace depending on community capacity and readiness.”

There are 72 funded sports organizations in B.C. with 4,100 local sport organizations with more than 800,000 participants from youth to masters. To date, according to viaSport, 60 organizations have completed their return to play plans.

B.C. Soccer, for instance, announced throw-ins will be replaced by kick-ins from the sidelines in order to limit hand-to-ball contact.

Bo Horvat scored twice, and Tyler Toffoli and Elias Pettersson each had a goal and two assists as the Canucks defeated the Golden Knights 5-2 at Rogers Place.

The best-of-seven second-round series is tied 1-1. Game 3 goes Thursday.

Forty-eight hours earlier, the Golden Knights, now 8-2 in the post-season, had manhandled the Canucks en route to a 5-0 pounding in Game 1.

""For us as a team we wanted to bounce back from Game 1. We weren't happy with that,"" said Pettersson.

""We played a good game. We should be happy about it but (we need) a short-term memory and be ready for Game 3.""

Goaltender Jacob Markstrom made 38 saves for the win while Robin Lehner stopped 22 shots for Vegas. It's the first time Vegas has allowed more than five goals in a game in the return-to-play tournament.

It was the first game back for Toffoli since the opening game of the qualifying round against the Minnesota Wild on Aug. 2. The NHL is not releasing information on injuries, but Toffoli had been seen in a walking boot.

Toffoli jumped over the boards for his first shift in the first period and scored nine seconds later, taking a cross-crease pass from Pettersson to put the puck into a yawning net. He then made it 2-0 on the power play, delivering a tape-to-tape pass to an incoming Horvat, who blasted it past Lehner.

""It's fun to get back in the lineup and get a big win and tie this series up,"" said Toffoli, who had been acquired at the trade deadline from the Los Angeles Kings. He had put up 10 points in his first 10 games with the Canucks before the regular season ended March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I made some phone calls yesterday, talked to a lot of people. It was a busy day,"" said Toffoli. ""It was good obviously getting the OK from everybody (to play). I got all excited. Felt like I was coming back to my first playoff series.""

Vancouver coach Travis Green said the 5-0 loss was their worst game of the playoffs and that Game 2 was a must-win.

""You go down two (games) against that team early in the series it would be tough and just mentally, too (to come back),"" he said.

""We were better with the puck, played a more direct game. I thought we were better on our feet, quicker. That's a good hockey team. I thought we did a good job of making them defend more than we did the first game.""

Despite being down by two goals in the second period, the Golden Knights looked like they were going to run the Canucks out of the rink again.

Markstrom kept the Canucks alive as Vegas tilted the ice and turned his net into a shooting gallery, blasting away for 22 shots in the period. Vegas got one goal back from Alex Tuch before Pettersson scored on a cross-ice feed from Alex Edler to make it 3-1 heading into the third.

""That really was a back-breaker,"" said Vegas head coach Peter DeBoer. ""You're down 3-1 and you have nothing to show for the work you put in to try and get back in the game.""

Tuch added: ""We knew Vancouver wasn't happy with the way they played last game and we knew they were going to come out flying. And we decided instead of being prepared, (to) be surprised by that for some reason.""

Vancouver iced the game 18 seconds into the third on Horvat's second goal. Then the frustration finally got to Vegas.

First, Max Pacioretty grabbed J.T. Miller by the head and threw him down after the whistle for a roughing penalty. Tuch got a double minor for pummelling Jake Virtanen while the Vancouver forward lay on the ice.

Pacioretty scored late for Vegas and Tanner Pearson added the final Vancouver goal into an empty net.

Horvat had not found the scoresheet since scoring two goals in each of the first two games against the St. Louis Blues in the first round.

Pettersson has been a steady point-getter throughout the playoffs but had been shut down by Vegas in Game 1, limited to no shots on net and one blocked shot.

Markstrom, in his first playoff series, has been the locomotive pulling the Canucks' playoff train. He allowed just nine goals on 121 shots (.926 save percentage) against Minnesota in the first round while registering his first playoff shutout. He saved 29 of 34 against the Blues (.930).

The series is being played at a fan-less Rogers Place. Players are isolating between contests to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This was Williams’ fifth match since professional tennis resumed amid the coronavirus pandemic after a hiatus of nearly six months — and all five have gone three sets. She is 3-2 in that stretch.

The result against No. 13 seed Sakkari, and particularly the way the match ended, was hardly promising for Williams as the U.S. Open’s start approaches next week.

The Western & Southern Open is usually held in Ohio but was moved to the U.S. Open’s site in Flushing Meadows this year to make for a two-event, no-spectator ""bubble"" during the pandemic.

In men's play, Canada's Milos Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Andy Murray. Raonic, from Thornhill, Ont., is the last Canadian remaining in the draw.

Williams was seemingly in control early, serving for the first set at 5-3, 30-0, when things began to unravel. She missed two backhands in a row, then put a forehand into the net to set up a break point, and walked over to the stand holding her towel at the back of the court (the ball people normally handle towels for players, but not during COVID-19).

That’s when chair umpire Aurelie Tourte called a time violation. On the following point, Williams sailed a forehand long to get broken.

At the ensuing changeover, the 23-time Grand Slam champion argued with Tourte, saying: ""I mean, I’m getting my own towels. That’s not fair. You should tell me on the sidelines next time if I need to play faster. Believe me, I will. ... You didn't even give me a warning.""

While Williams eventually did grab that set, she again frittered away a 5-3 lead in the second, plus a 4-1 edge in the tiebreaker. When she sat after the second set, the 38-year-old American tossed her racket over her shoulder the way an office worker might flip a crumpled piece of paper toward a trash can.

Williams came out flat in the third set, as if she’d rather be anywhere else. She double-faulted four times in the second game, including on Sakkari’s eighth break chance, to make it 2-0 and that was pretty much that.

Hours earlier, Novak Djokovic’s neck felt much better, and his tennis looked much better, in a 6-2, 6-4 victory over unseeded American Tennys Sandgren that improved the No. 1-ranked man to 20-0 in 2020.

""Actually, I’m pleasantly surprised with the way I recovered and felt today — just overall, physically, but also with the neck, specifically, because that was a little bit of a concern,"" said Djokovic, who will be eyeing his 18th Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open. ""Going back four, five days, I did struggle quite a lot.""

Djokovic was treated by a trainer and played sluggishly in his opening match Monday, but he was at his best from the outset against Sandgren and saved all four break points he faced.

Djokovic will face 34th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff in the quarterfinals. The other quarterfinal in the top half of the draw will be defending champion Daniil Medvedev against No. 8 seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Reilly Opelka, a 6-foot-11 American who is ranked 39th, delivered 19 aces and knocked off 2019 U.S. Open semifinalist Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 7-6 (4). Opelka next meets No. 4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, whose 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4) win over No. 16 John Isner was interrupted by a rain delay of nearly 1 1/2 hours late in the first set.

Also interrupted by the weather was Raonic's victory over the three-time Grand Slam champion. Raonic, a Wimbledon runner-up in 2016, has held all 29 games he’s served so far in the tournament.

""I have done the work,"" Raonic said. ""I have put in the effort, and I'm just happy that this quickly the pieces are coming together.""

This was Murray's first tournament appearance since November. He missed time due to a pelvic injury and is playing on a metal hip after two operations on that joint.

""Didn’t play well. It was not a good day,"" Murray said. ""The positives are that I got three matches in. Physically, I pulled up OK.""

Women’s quarterfinal matchups set earlier in the day were two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka against Anett Kontaveit, former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka against Ons Jabeur, and 83rd-ranked American qualifier Jessica Pegula against No. 14 Elise Mertens.

Hawerchuk and Corrigan were linemates, along with Marc Crawford, when the Cornwall Royals won the Memorial Cup Canadian major-junior championship in 1979-80. That ring is a cherished keepsake for Corrigan, the former CEO of B.C. Ferries. So are his recollections of the Hockey Hall of Famer Hawerchuk, who died last week at 57.

“He was such a nice and humble guy and remained that way his entire life,” said Corrigan.

“He always talked about other people first – about how important I was to the line – never about himself. He was that type of person.”

Winning a championship in any sport is a bond that remains with those players who went through the experience together.

“We were all just kids, but it sticks with you forever,” said Corrigan.

“Dale was 16 and Marc and I were both 18 the season we won the Memorial Cup. Dale was a skinny-legged kid and Marc and I made sure nobody bothered him. But Dale was impossible to hit, regardless.”

Hawerchuk led Cornwall to a second consecutive Memorial Cup title in 1980-81. The Victoria Cougars were the Western Hockey League representatives that year in the Memorial Cup but were unable to stop Hawerchuk, even with the likes of Grant Fuhr, Barry Pederson, Torrie Robertson, Mark Morrison, Paul Cyr, Rich Chernomaz, Geoff Courtnall, Bob McGill and Tony Feltrin in the Victoria line-up.

Corrigan had been traded and played for the Sudbury Wolves that season, so missed out on the Memorial Cup double with Hawerchuk and Crawford.

Corrigan was selected in the fifth round of the 1980 NHL draft, 88th overall by the Detroit Red Wings, and drifted around for three seasons in the minor-pro system with the Adirondack Red Wings and Kalamazoo Wings before bigger things as an executive away from hockey.

Crawford went on to coach, including Colorado to the Stanley Cup, in Vancouver with the Canucks, and Canada at the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics.

“That line all had success in life in different ways,” noted Corrigan, who formerly coached the Victoria Breakers girls’ teams, and is still involved in the international ferry business.

“I ran B.C. Ferries, but people are far more intrigued if I tell them about my hockey career and the guys I played with, because that is the unique interest people have in sports,” said Corrigan.

He can proudly say he played with one of the best, with the ring to prove it.

He was 5 under after the front nine Tuesday at Ozarks National when he hit driver at the par-4 10th. The ball wound up in such heavy rough that Mickelson couldn't find it, forcing him to take a penalty stroke. He still wound up making a long putt to salvage bogey, and that gave him some momentum for the rest of the round.

""I was able to get right back to even par on the back side with a birdie on the next hole, and then I made a couple more coming in,"" said Mickelson, whose 7-under 64 left him 17 under.

That was good for a four-shot lead over Tim Petrovic and Rod Pampling, who will be his playing partners for the final round. Mike Weir of Bright's Grove, Ont., (69) was nine shots off the lead at 8 under.

""I've been putting really well,"" Mickelson said. ""Today I didn't drive it the way I've been driving it. I kind of a hung a few drives, so I'm going to the range and try to work on that now. But when I come out tomorrow I'll try to be a little bit more aggressive with the driver and see if I can make a few more birdies.""

A few more? He's already made 19 of them in his first 36 holes.

Playing in the final group and with the shadows getting long, Mickelson picked up right where he left off after his opening-round 61. He made birdie at the third and then rattled off three straight beginning at the par-4 fifth, where he nearly chipped in for eagle.

Petrovic tried to make a run at Mickelson, but even one of his career-low rounds only got him so close. His putter went cold down the stretch and a poor approach at the par-4 finishing hole resulted in bogey.

Mickelson added a bridie at the ninth, the only hole he bogeyed on Monday, after a pretty flop shot over the bunker. After the lost ball at the 10th, Mickelson responded by adding two more birdies.

The second of them at the par-3 12th was a backhanded tap-in. His approach shot barely carried onto the front edge of the green, then nestled up to about an inch from the hole.

Mickelson could still squander the lead in the final round Wednesday, when tee times were moved to the early morning because of expected bad weather in the afternoon. But given the quality of his short game through 36 holes, the more pressing question is whether he could break the PGA Tour Champions' 54-hole scoring record of 191 — shared by Bruce Fleisher, Loren Roberts, Bernhard Langer, David Frost and Rocco Mediate.

Mickelson, who decided to make his debut on the over-50 tour to continue his U.S. Open prep after he was eliminated from the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, would need to shoot 65 in his final round Wednesday to move atop the list.

Petrovic and Pampling each shot 64-65 over the first two rounds. Rocco Mediate struggled coming in and was at 12 under.

K.J. Choi was another shot back, and Steve Stricker and David McKenzie were at 10 under.

Moments later, the Chicago White Sox right-hander threw the final pitch in a truly bizarre performance.

article continues below

A no-fan no-no.

With the seats at Guaranteed Rate Field empty, Giolito pitched the first no-hitter of the pandemic-delayed season, striking out 13 in leading the White Sox over the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 Tuesday night.

""2020 has been a very strange year,"" said Giolito, who conducted a postgame interview while wearing a mask. ""Obviously a lot of weird stuff going on with COVID and the state of the world, so may as well throw this in the mix.""

Sounds like he didn't mind that nobody saw it. Well, almost no one.

After right fielder Adam Engel extended on the run to catch Erik Gonzalez’s slicing drive toward the line for the final out, the hollers of Giolito’s teammates in the middle of the diamond echoed around the stadium.

""I’m just stoked for Lucas and so happy and ecstatic and emotional for Lucas,"" Engel said. ""It stinks we couldn’t celebrate the way most no-hitters get celebrated.""

The smallest crowd listed for any no-hitter in the majors over the last 100 years came in 1944, when a mere 1,014 watched Cincinnati’s Clyde Shoun beat the Braves at Crosley Field.

Nowhere close to that number on this night, not with the park that holds over 40,000 closed to fans because of virus protocols.

Suffice to say, years from now when White Sox fans fondly remember Giolito’s gem, there will not be, say, 100,000 or so people claiming they were there to see it in person.

At one point early in the game, some members of grounds crew drifted in sight, but that was about it outside of the teams.

An All-Star last year, the 26-year-old Giolito (3-2) matched his career high for strikeouts set in his previous start against Detroit.

Only a four-pitch walk to Gonzalez leading off the fourth inning got in Giolito’s way of perfection. That was only runner he permitted while throwing 101 pitches

""I’ve been working for this type of game for a while now and it’s really cool that we got it done,"" Giolito said.

Giolito relied on his changeup and fastball to make quick work of the Pirates, who came into the game batting just .229 and have the worst record in the majors. Six of their starters finished the game hitting under .199 this season.

The White Sox rushed toward the mound after the final out in Giolito’s first career no-hitter. Giolito hugged catcher James McCann as the Chicago players joined the party.

The South Side of Chicago normally rattles with fireworks after a home win -- this is the club that gave the game the exploding scoreboard -- but the park remained silent as the dugout emptied.

Giolito, meanwhile, was locked in his own zone in the later innings, fully aware of what was at stake.

""After the seventh, six more outs, looking at who I was facing, became very, very, very possible,"" he said, ""and then we were able to get it done.""

Giolito said his approach never wavered.

""Just staying with the same, like, mental routine for every single pitch. One pitch at a time. Full focus, full execution, straight through the target,"" he said.

Giolito pitched the 19th no-hitter in White Sox history — second most to the Dodgers' 23 — and first since Philip Humber threw a perfect game at Seattle in 2012. This was the seventh time the Pirates have been held hitless, with Washington’s Max Scherzer having done it in 2015.

White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson made a nifty play on a grounder by Bryan Reynolds up the middle in the seventh to preserve the gem, helped by first baseman Jose Abreu’s stretch at the bag.

In the ninth, Gonzalez hit a liner that Engel, a fleet centre fielder for most of his career, caught on the run at knee-high height.

""Yeah man, I think I got it,"" Gonzalez said. ""With that at-bat, I was a little bit mad because I don’t want to be part of history.""

Giolito improved to 30-28 in his big league career. He made his debut with Washington in 2016, then was traded after that season to the White Sox in a package for outfielder Adam Eaton.

Giolito gave up a major league-high 118 earned runs in 2018, his first full season in Chicago.

""I was pretty much bottom of the league in almost every stat,"" Giolito said. ""I kind of had to ... learn from failure to learn my true potential.""

He added: ""I always envisioned that I’d throw a no-hitter in the big leagues.""

Giolito threw the first no-hitter at Guaranteed Rate Field since Minnesota’s Francisco Liriano did it in 2011.

The White Sox, who’ve won eight of their last nine, ended the Pirates’ season-best winning streak at three games.

Giolito was dominant in his previous start, too, fanning 13 against Detroit and allowing just three hits in seven innings. The victory over Pittsburgh was his third career shutout.

Chicago’s first three batters reached in the second and all three came home one at a time after Engel’s groundout and singles Anderson and Eloy Jimenez. McCann added a sacrifice fly in the third off Steven Brault (0-1).

TRAINER’S ROOM

Pirates: RH reliever Keone Kela was available to pitch after leaving Friday’s loss to Milwaukee with forearm tightness. … Infielders Colin Moran (collision) and Kevin Newman (abdomen) also were on the bench after leaving Sunday’s game.

White Sox: McCann stayed in the game after being struck near his left hand by a second-inning pitch from Brault. ... Jimenez appeared to be getting treatment near the mound after the celebration, but manager Rick Renteria said he walked off under his own power.

His team gave up a goal he felt shouldn't have counted three minutes into the opening period and had a subsequent equalizer called back on a razor-thin offside challenge.

Down 1-0 in the series and playing well, Tampa Bay then grabbed its first lead in more than 110 minutes of action midway through the third period only to see Boston tie it up with under four minutes to go in regulation.

""Adversity strikes in the weirdest ways,"" Cooper said. ""You never know when it's going to happen.

""Sometimes you're just dealt ... a sandwich that doesn't taste very good, if you know what I mean.""

And deal with it they did.

Ondrej Palat scored at 4:40 of overtime as the Lightning defeated the Bruins 4-3 to even their second-round playoff series 1-1.

Blake Coleman added two goals in regulation for the Lightning, while Nikita Kucherov had the other. Andrei Vasilevskiy made 22 saves to get the win.

""If there was one message that was going on it was we liked everything that was going on about the game,"" Cooper said. ""I know it sounds so cliche, but we just had to stick with it. Some teams, if you have mental weakness at all, you're probably sitting there saying, 'Poor us.'

""But it's just not been this group. That's not how they operate.""

Brad Marchand buried his second of the night to tie things with under four minutes left in the third period for the Bruins, while Nick Ritchie also scored. David Pastrnak added two assists for Boston, which got 36 stops from Jaroslav Halak.

The teams don't have much time to digest the result, with Game 3 of the best-of-seven matchup set for Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET back inside the fan-less Scotiabank Arena.

Tampa, which beat the Columbus Blue Jackets in quintuple overtime of Game 1 in the opening round before closing out the series in the extra period of Game 5 on a pair of goals from Brayden Point, got the winner after Boston couldn't clear its zone.

Patrick Maroon tried a wraparound that Halak stopped, but Palat was there to bury the rebound to score his first of the post-season and send the Lightning pouring off their bench in celebration.

""It's obviously big-time frustrating any time you lose a game and especially in that fashion,"" Bruins centre Sean Kuraly said. ""We thought we were trending in the right direction, (thinking) momentum may be swinging our way. You get the puck close to the blue line a couple times and you don't get it out, and against a good team that's what happens.

""It ends up in the back of your net.""

Acquired prior to February's trade deadline from the New Jersey Devils, Coleman gave Tampa its first lead of the series at 10:40 of the third after taking a stretch pass from Victor Hedman. The Lightning centre moved in alone on Halak and snuck an off-speed shot through the five-hole after getting slashed by Bruins defenceman Connor Clifton.

Boston, however, responded with 3:58 left in regulation when Marchand finished off a pretty passing play. With the Bruins in the middle of a change — Patrice Bergeron would normally be on the ice — Kuraly took a feed from Pastrnak and quickly found Marchand to bury his sixth and knot things up.

The Bruins, who triumphed 3-2 in Game 1 on the back of Halak's 35-save performance, took a 2-1 lead with 5:27 left in the second on a power play when Pastrnak faked a one-timer before sliding a pass to Marchand at the side of the net.

Tampa responded 56 seconds later after some great work from Point. The diminutive centre twisted and turned in the Bruins zone before finding Kevin Shattenkirk, whose shot was tipped in by Kucherov for his third.

The Lightning dressed seven defencemen with Ryan McDonagh (undisclosed), who has averaged a team-high 26:07 of ice time in the post-season, out injured after leaving midway through the third period of Game 1. Veteran blue-liners Luke Schenn and Braydon Coburn drew in, while Carter Verhaeghe was scratched up front.

Boston owned the best record in the NHL when the league suspended its season because of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, but dropped to the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference after losing all three of its games in the round-robin portion of the restart.

The Bruins found their groove in the first round of the usual 16-team playoff bracket, disposing of the Carolina Hurricanes in five games.

Tampa, meanwhile, had the second-best mark in the East and was fourth overall when the schedule was halted. The Lightning finished second in the round-robin and then downed Columbus.

The Bruins jumped out to a 1-0 lead at 3:14 of Tuesday's first period after Tampa defenceman Zach Bogosian's stick disintegrated at the offensive blue line. Boston broke the other way, with Ritchie stuffing his first past Vasilevskiy, who thought he had the puck covered — much to Cooper's chagrin.

The Lightning responded a couple minutes later when Barclay Goodrow tipped Coburn's point shot up and over Halak. The Bruins, however, correctly challenged for offside after Point was a fraction of a second too slow exiting the Boston zone on the tag up.

Cooper fired a number of expletives at the officials when the call was reversed, but was back smiling on the bench after a surprising burst from an unlikely source eventually knotted the score.

Bogosian, a bruising blue-liner known mostly for his physical play, split two Boston defenders, and as he was getting knocked down fed a diving Coleman, who slid his second past Halak before crashing into the net at 12:42.

""I saw Bogo picking up some speed,"" Coleman said. ""He just kind of had that look in his eye like he was about to do something. I just made it a point to get up into play with him, try to give him an option.

""He made a heck of a play.""

It was also the first sign the Lightning weren't going to be fazed by that early adversity.

""Any time there's a mishap, you just turn the page,"" Cooper said of his roster. ""It was needed tonight, I'll tell you that, because they need to be rewarded for the work they were doing.

""And in the end, they were.""

George had shot 29% in the series and endured fans' wrath on social media. He said he spoke to the team psychiatrist before Game 5.

""I mean, whatever it was, the bubble got the best of me,"" George said. ""I was just in a dark place. I really wasn’t here. I checked out. The past couple of games, it was just difficult.""

George said it didn't feel like the playoffs until his teammates decided to create the atmosphere that was lacking inside the NBA's Walt Disney World bubble.

""I came in with that mindset that this is Staples, we’re at home,"" he said. ""The place is packed. I really had to psych myself up. I thought the whole team took that and we ran with it. We created our own energy. We decided to dictate this game.""

Kawhi Leonard scored 32 points and Montrezl Harrell added 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers, who set a franchise record for points in a playoff game. Los Angeles can clinch the series on Thursday.

Dallas' Luka Doncic, who hit a game-winner at the buzzer in Game 4 to cap off a 43-point triple-double, was held to 22 points on 6-for-17 shooting.

Dallas coach Rick Carlisle was ejected in the third quarter of the testy game, which included six technicals and a flagrant-1 foul.

Doncic said Clippers forward Marcus Morris might have stepped on his ankle intentionally early in the third quarter.

""I don’t want to talk to him,"" Doncic said. ""He’s just saying a lot of bad stuff to me all the game. I don’t want to talk to him. I’ve just got to move on. Like I said, everybody’s going to have their own opinion. I just hope it wasn’t intentional. If that was intentional, that’s very bad.""

Mavericks centre Kristaps Porzingis sat out with right knee soreness. It was the second straight game the 7-foot-3 Latvian missed.

Leonard scored 22 points and Paul George scored 18 to help Los Angeles take a 76-52 lead at halftime. The Clippers shot 61% in the first half and led by as many as 27 points.

The Clippers continued the onslaught in the second half, bumping the lead to as many as 45 points.

""Tough game,"" Carlisle said. ""Very poor performance by us. It was disappointing. It was very physical. We just need to have a stronger physical disposition to start the game and throughout. We’ve got to get some more traction at both ends of the floor.""

TIP-INS

Mavericks: Doncic was issued a technical foul in the second quarter. ... G Tim Hardaway Jr. was called for a flagrant-1 after winding up and hitting George in the face on a drive. ... Assistant Stephen Silas took over as coach after Carlisle was ejected.

Clippers: Shot 67% from the field in the first quarter. ... Hardaway and Morris were called for double technicals in the second quarter. C Ivica Zubac was called for a technical in the third.

BIGGER THAN BASKETBALL

Clippers coach Doc Rivers was emotional while discussing the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which has sparked national outrage and some violent protests. Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back while his three children watched.

""That video, if you watch that video — you don’t need to be Black to be outraged,"" Rivers said. ""You need to be American and outraged. How dare the Republicans talk about fear. We’re the ones that need to be scared. We’re the ones having to talk to every Black child. What white father has to give his son a talk about being careful if you get pulled over? It’s just ridiculous. It keeps going. There’s no charges. Breonna Taylor — no charges. Nothing. All we’re asking is you live up to the Constitution. That’s all we’re asking -- for everybody. For everyone.""

CARLISLE'S EJECTION

Carlisle described what led to his ejection. Hardaway had the ball at the free-throw line, and then Rivers was granted a timeout.

""My understanding in that situation is that once a shooter has the ball, a timeout cannot be called by the opposing coach,"" Carlisle said. ""I thought the call was wrong. So I was asking about it and wasn’t getting a great explanation and then it turned into a technical and then another technical. I’m just standing up for my team.""

Game 6 is Thursday.

In fact, The Escoffier Cookbook: And Guide to the Fine Art of Cookery for Connoisseurs, Chefs, ­Epicures, offers 12 different preparations.

Among them is one of Escoffier’s most famous dishes, pêche Melba, peach Melba, in English. It’s a fairly simple dessert where sugar-sweetened, skinned peach halves are set on vanilla ice cream and topped with raspberry puree. With ripe, juicy peaches and ruby red raspberries, Escoffier wisely chose to let their flavour shine by not muddling it with myriad ingredients.

article continues below

Escoffier created the first ­version of this dessert while working as the chef at London’s Savoy Hotel during the late 1890s. During that time Australian opera singer Nellie Melba came to London, performed at Covent Garden, and often dined at the Savoy.

Escoffier and Melba became acquainted and lore suggests that one day she sent him tickets to see her in the Wagner opera Lohengrin, whose set featured a swan-shaped boat.

Escoffier must have enjoyed her performance because the following evening when she came for dinner he created a special dessert for her. To make it, vanilla ice cream was set in a silver-serving dish and topped with fresh peaches. The silver-serving dish was then perched atop a swan carved from ice and Escoffier called his creation pecheau cygne, “peach with a swan,” in English.

When Escoffier left the Savoy and began working at London’s Ritz Carlton he tweaked the dish by also topping the peaches and ice cream with raspberry purée. He also renamed it, calling it — you guessed it — peach Melba.

The dessert was a hit and eventually other chefs around the world began serving it. That, in turn, explains why you now see variations on how peach Melba is made, especially with how the peaches are prepared.

For example, some recipes ask you to blanch, skin, half, pit and then cook the peach halves in simple syrup (sugar dissolved in water).Others ask you to cook halved, pitted peaches in simple syrup and then skin them. And yet others, particularly American cookbooks in the 1960s, go the convenience route and tell you to use packed-in-syrup canned peach halves.

However, in The History Kitchen section of the PBS ­website, pbs.org, they’ve posted what screenwriter/food historian Tori Avey says is the original peach Melba recipe, Escoffier’s words translated from French.

In this case, the peaches are quickly blanched in boiling water, cooled, skinned, halved and pitted. If desired, at this point you can soak the peach halves 10 minutes in acidulated water to help them from discolouring. Now, instead of poaching the peach halves in simple syrup, they are simple sprinkled with sugar, allowed to sit awhile and as they do the sugar dissolves and turns syrupy. The peaches are then served on ice cream and topped with raspberry puree. You also have the options to sprinkle the peach Melba with toasted almonds.

My recipe is similar in style, except I decided to halve the peaches and remove the pits before blanching them and removing the skins. I did that because to make peach Melba you need to use ripe peaches. And when you halve and pit them after they’ve been blanched, you can damage the tender flesh.

Neatly halving and pitting peaches is also much easier if you use freestone peaches. As their name suggests, they have flesh that does not cling tightly to the stone, unlike clingstone peaches, that have flesh that does.

If you bought unripe peaches, they’ll eventually become ripe if you leave them out a room temperature. But you can speed up the process by placing them in a single layer in a paper bag. Seal the bag and leave it at room ­temperature for a day or more and ethylene gas the fruit gives off will quicken the ripening process. To speed it up even more, also put an apple in the bag with the peaches, as it has more ethylene gas than peaches and will further hasten the process.

Peach Melba

Here’s my version of the perfect-for-late-summer dessert that famed French chef Auguste Escoffier invented more than 120 years ago. You’ll need ripe peaches for this. So, plan ahead and make sure the peaches you have will be ripe by the time you make and serve the peach Melba.

Preparation time: 60 minutes

Cooking time: One to two minutes

Makes: four servings

1 1/3 cups fresh or frozen (thawed) raspberries (see Note)

1/3 cup water

1/4 cup icing sugar, or to taste (see Eric options)

4 ripe, small to medium, freestone peaches

1 Tbsp lemon juice

1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract

8 tsp granulated sugar

• vanilla ice cream, to taste

4 mint sprigs

Place the raspberries, water and icing sugar in a food processor or blender, or in the cup that came your immersion (hand) blender. Puree the raspberries. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl, using a small whisk to whisk and press out as much liquid as you can. Cover this raspberry puree and refrigerate until needed.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cut each peach in half and remove the stones. Add the peach halves to the water and cook one minute, or until the skins easily slip off the peaches.

Lift peaches out of the boiling water, set on a large plate and cool until safe enough to handle. Now carefully pull off the skins.

Set peaches in 13- x 9-inch dish, drizzle with the lemon juice and vanilla, and turn to coat. Set peaches cut side up. Sprinkle the top of each peach half with 1 tsp of granulated sugar. Cover peaches and refrigerate one hour. Turn each peach over and let sit one hour more, or until you’re ready to make the Peach Melba. (The raspberry puree and peaches can be prepared to this point many hours in advance of serving.)

When ready to serve, scoop some vanilla ice cream into each of four serving dishes (see Eric’s options). Set two peach halves, curved-side-up, and some of the syrup around them, on top of the ice cream in each bowl. Top peaches with raspberry puree, garnish with mint sprigs, and serve.

Note: If using frozen raspberries, measure them before thawing. After thawing, if there’s a lot of liquid around them, reduce the amount of water you add to the puree.

Eric’s options: Instead of icing sugar, sweeten the raspberry puree with honey, to taste. For added richness, you could also top the peach Melba with toasted, sliced or slivered almonds, to taste. You could scoop the ice cream into the serving dishes an hour or two before serving the peach Melba. After doing so, set the dishes in the freezer and keep there until ready to top with the peaches and raspberry puree.

Fear exists for the purpose of keeping us away from danger. However, the word “dangerous” can mean a million different things to different people. That is because many things fall into the category of danger. Those elements are different for each, and every individual. If we see things as dangerous, we fear them. The question we must ask ourselves is why do we see these things as dangerous? Is it because of something we know, or something we think we know? Is it common knowledge, or is it ignorance? The line between those two concepts seems to blur far too easily. The key to their separation is to dive deeper and deeper into the “why” until you find the root cause of your fear. It is where you will find the difference between fearing spiders because they can be poisonous and fearing a person because society teaches you to. This world is incredibly complicated and all we can do is try to understand each other. The only way to do that is through communication and empathy. At the end of the day, we will never be able to understand exactly what it is like to be in someone else's shoes. We will never see the full picture. Understanding this, is the only way to extinguish the fear. Knowing that we do not and cannot know everything is the only way to end a fear that is ignited by ignorance.

To me, there are three types of fear.

Logical fear: the type of fear that tells us to be cautious while driving because someone is at risk of getting hurt.

Dream-restricting fear: the type of fear that holds us back from our dreams and causes us to think of risk as danger when in fact the only danger is failure. But who says failure is a bad thing?

Finally, racism-fueled fear: the type of fear that is fueled by stereotypes and ignorance. It tells people to fear other people who have no intention of harming anyone. Fear was engineered to keep us alive, yet it can also keep us from living, figuratively and literally. It has turned from something meant to keep us safe, to a plague that spreads like wildfire and ensures that no one is safe. We are now in a world where humans fear other humans because of their race, religion or because of their appearance. This is the ugliest form of fear. It is one that divides countries and communities and causes people to take lives, valuable human lives, of kind and wonderful people, out of the fear of losing their own. The type of fear that stops someone at an airport because of the way they practice their faith. It is the type of fear that causes some of mankind's most horrid and unjust actions.

Nonetheless, we have the power to eliminate this fear. We can do this by building bridges among communities and transform the fear into knowledge of, and respect for, one another. We need to stop being okay with believing things simply because the world does. We need to think for ourselves and decide what is a logical fear and what is an ignorant fear. Then, and only then, can we begin to improve the way we see and treat each other, one individual at a time. We can conquer fear, eliminate division, and transform the world into a brighter place, one that replaces fear with hope and sees the end of a never-ending struggle.

It didn’t relate to the preceding sentence, so it seemed at first to be a non-sequitur. Yet there was obviously a purpose and meaning in those words. Internal “this is important” bells went off, because I sensed this was something I needed to understand.

It’s astonishing how the wisdom of a culture can be encoded in such small phrases, embedded in words and stories passed down through generations and known in the bones. And yet, to a person from another culture it can be unrecognizable, incomprehensible. Another language. For that reason, intercultural understanding can be infinitely richer and more valuable than we’d ever suspect.

A few years before his passing, Canadian author Richard Wagamese wrote that the phrase “‘All my relations’ means all.” He explained, “Because when you say those words you mean everything that you are kin to. Not just those people who look like you, talk like you, act like you, sing, dance, celebrate, worship or pray like you. Everyone. You also mean everything that relies on air, water, sunlight and the power of the Earth and the universe itself for sustenance and perpetuation. It's recognition of the fact that we are all one body moving through time and space together. To say these words is to offer a doorway to that understanding to those who hear you. It's to proclaim in one sentence that this experience of living is a process of coming together and that it was always meant to be.”

Trying to understand “all my relations” caused reflections that became a powerful mirror. It’s meant coming to terms with the culture of my birth, its missing pieces, its biases, its emphatic individualism, its competitive ethos. It’s meant reassessing the assumption that the world is zero sum, that my gain is your loss and fighting is unavoidable.

Poking around cultural assumptions, turning over their rocks, isn’t always comfortable but it’s great for learning. When I was twenty I became a Bahá’í, whose teachings encourage people to be unifiers and peacemakers. That can be a stretch when you come from a somewhat confrontational background. At first, I was totally non-plussed by Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement that if two souls quarrel about a question of religion, both are wrong. Even more perplexing was the unequivocal statement that “conflict and contention are in no wise permitted”. There was no mention of this not applying if the other person is wrong, offensive or the one who started it!

“The shining spark of truth cometh forth only after the clash of differing opinions,” was an easier teaching to understand. But that too required learning and unlearning, since the exchange is to be done with such “courtesy, dignity, care and moderation” that “no occasion for ill-feeling or discord may arise.”

It’s been a long, still unfinished road for me, learning about unity, its tones, its intricate music. At times I feel like someone who has grown up in another language, one lacking a certain sound that then becomes very difficult to pronounce, or even distinguish, as an adult.

The small phrase “all my relations” at the end of a talk many years ago contained an invaluable key to understanding that unity isn’t merely an ideal or aspiration. It’s a recognition of our essential reality, where we’re coming from and where we’re going, and infinitely more important than being right or proving a point. It’s so important that it deserves constant mention. For that, I’m profoundly grateful.

Early this week, there was a flutter of consternation within the arts community over COVID-19, the virus that’s now reached pandemic proportions. By Thursday night, announcements of show cancellations — some of them last-minute — had swelled from a trickle to a fast-flowing river.

I first heard of this Thursday. That night, I was set to attend a performance of Lillian Hellman’s The Children’s Hour staged by University of Victoria’s Phoenix Theatre. Then Adrienne Holierhoek, the theatre’s publicist, emailed me with sobering news: the performance was cancelled.

“We’re not going ahead with a public performance, as we’re on the verge of the 250 limit,” she said. Holierhoek would now spend a busy night doing damage control.

She added wryly: “Let’s just say I’m having granola bars for dinner.”

As is the case with many performing arts companies in Victoria and throughout the province, the cancellation was in deference to a recommendation by B.C. health officer Bonnie Henry. On Thursday she suggested cancelling events expected to draw crowds of 250 or more to help contain the highly contagious virus.

That night, the list of cancellations continued to grow. Pacific Opera Victoria’s production of Flight of the Hummingbird, set to run Friday to March 22, is postponed indefinitely. The Victoria Symphony has discontinued its concerts. Dance Victoria says this weekend’s performances of Romeo + Juliet by Ballet B.C. are cancelled.

The Royal and McPherson theatres are closed until further notice.

Yesterday morning, I sat down to write a review of Busted Up: A Yukon Story, which played the Belfry Theatre’s Spark Festival. It’s a first-rate show and was to conclude its run tonight.

Later that morning, the Belfry’s communications director, Mark Dusseault, told me his company had made the difficult decision to cancel further Spark Festival performances. This festival, a showcase of new theatre, was originally to continue to March 22.

“It’s heartbreaking,” said Dusseault.

A decision had to be made quickly. One company was preparing to fly to Victoria from its home province of Newfoundland for Spark shows. The Belfry didn’t want them to invest effort, time and expense, only to learn their run was canceled.

Langham Court Theatre has cancelled today’s final performances of I and You.

Manager Michelle Buck said Langham Court originally considered capping the audience at 75 (the theatre’s capacity is 175) to allow for “social distancing” — that is, leaving physical spaces between attendees.

But in the end, the company — regretfully — decided to play it safe.

“It’s such a good little show,” Buck said. “It’s sad to pull it from underneath them.”

Dusseault, who has worked in theatre for 30 years, cannot remember a situation like this ever occurring before in Victoria. Yes, there have been other calamities: 9/11, the Gulf War, the global SARS outbreak of 2003. But nothing ever shut down the arts scene like COVID-19 has.

Not every theatre company has closed its doors. Blue Bridge Repertory Theatre says no upcoming events at its Roxy Theatre have been cancelled. The Roxy will host a musical tribute to the Beatles March 26 to 29.

It is, of course, disappointing for audiences when performances are cancelled. You not only miss out on the show, there’s the task of getting a refund. Yet for arts organizations, the fallout from this situation is much more profound.

Many companies scrape by to survive. Over the past 30 years, government funding has eroded. Audiences for opera, classical music and theatre are getting older. And in general, the battle for audiences is becoming much more intense.

For example, years ago, direct-to-consumer services such as Netflix didn’t even exist.

A new meme now making the social-media rounds suggests people holding tickets to cancelled shows should consider opting out of a refund. By doing so, you make a donation to the company in question.

It’s a noble notion worth considering. One potential legacy of COVID-19 is that it will shut down some arts organizations permanently. And once they go under, it’s difficult — if not impossible — to resurrect them.

Ours is a culturally rich city. During this difficult time, let us be aware of that, of the fragility and importance of the arts in Victoria."

And there’s the 2019 movie Five Feet Apart, about a young woman with cystic fibrosis who becomes romantically involved with an ailing young man.

Langham Court Theatre has just opened Lauren Gunderson’s 2014 play I and You. In this two-actor drama, Caroline, a high-school student with a serious liver ailment, receives a surprise visit from a classmate. Like a cactus flower in an inhospitable desert, young love ultimately blooms.

Caroline — feisty and smart — has never before met Anthony, a decent young man with a heart as big as Kansas. At the beginning, in true rom-com style, the pair spar and bicker furiously before bonding like Super Glue.

I and You was a hit, gleaning critical acclaim and enjoying well over 20 productions since it debuted. Gunderson has, meanwhile, emerged as one of America’s most produced playwrights.

Some will find I and You a touch jejune and sentimental in the manner of after-school TV specials.

A melodramatic surprise ending will leave you either thrilled or groaning. There’s a distinctly YA-lit vibe throughout this 90-minute play (I kept thinking of the classic line, “Stay gold, Ponyboy,” from S.E. Hinton’s The Outsiders).

An audience noticeably younger than Langham Court’s usual crowd responded enthusiastically to Thursday’s opening performance. Certainly this production of I and You, capably directed by John Han, has its share of strengths.

The show benefits from the talents of two promising actors. Jesse Deutscher (Caroline) and Justin Francis Lee (Anthony) offered well-rehearsed, energetic performances.

The detailed set is terrific — Caroline’s bedroom is stuffed with groovy teen detritus: vintage Elvis poster, lava lamp, cat-scratching post, retro-lamps and so on. Wide-screen clips of computer games and music videos work well; all light, video and sound cues were handled adroitly.

The play commences with Anthony, wearing a backward baseball cap, dropping in unannounced. He spouts a cryptic line that turns out to be a quote from Walt Whitman’s famous poem Song of Myself.

Caroline — a tiny girl in a too-big sweatshirt — is bewildered and frightened. Anthony hastily explains he’s volunteered to be her partner for a school assignment. Nonetheless Caroline, who is homebound because of her liver ailment, lashes out at the intruder for 20 or 30 minutes.

This introductory section is heavily salted with sitcom teen speak. “What is wrong with you, super hater?” says Anthony. “Walt Whitman can bite me,” says Caroline.

Eventually she does agree to a partnership — they’ll create a Whitman-inspired poster together. “How do you feel about glitter?” Caroline asks. “Philosophically I’m agnostic on glitter,” says Anthony.

It’s doubtful anyone outside a Neil Simon (or Lauren Gunderson) play actually speaks like this. Happily, about halfway through, the quip-fest subsides and we get to know the characters a little more.

Bon mots on the benefits of Chunky Monkey ice cream and Caroline’s toy turtle give way to heavier subjects. Anthony turns out to be a John Coltrane devotee; she digs Jerry Lee Lewis.

Caroline is a gifted photographer with a Whitman-esque love for minutia; he has just witnessed a terrible tragedy on the basketball court.

Deutscher, as Caroline, sometimes displayed flashes of nuance and a knack for subtle facial expression. And the more the playwright eased up on the shallow-end-of-the-pool banter, the more Lee was able to dig into the character of Anthony.

Gunderson intends to say something brave and refreshing about the fleeting, transcendent beauty of life — never a bad thing. And if I and You sends you back to that tattered copy of Walt Whitman poems on your bookshelf, so much the better.

The show continues at Langham Court to March 14."

Like many business owners, he closed his doors due to the pandemic.

Fisher took the opportunity to finish a three-year project — the transformation of a 1928 REO Speedwagon truck into a panel van.

Manufactured by the REO Motor Company (REO were the initials of its founder, Ransom Eli Olds), the truck saw a production run from 1915 to about 1935. (An American band appropriated the name in 1967.)

Although Fisher’s example started off as a flatbed truck, the Speedwagon (sometimes referred to as a Speed Wagon) was available in a variety of configurations from the factory, including a panel truck (commonly called a panel van).

“The project has been an incredible amount of fun,” said Fisher, whose memories of working with wood include a workbench at the foot of his bed when he was 11 years old. “It is meant to be esthetically pleasing, in some small way a piece of furniture on wheels.”

The project tested his carpentry skills.

“Not everything has straight lines — I had to bend and shape everything,” said Fisher, 62. “It’s similar to boatbuilding.”

The fabrication of the new roof involved fitting together numerous thin strips of wood.

Normally, white oak would be used, but due to our soggy climate Fisher decided to substitute Ipe wood from South America instead. While more durable to the elements, Ipe, also called Brazilian walnut, has a reputation of being a difficult wood to work on. The finished structure was covered in the traditional way — using canvas stretched on the frame.

Fisher also repainted the vehicle.

“Spraying a vehicle is similar to spraying furniture,” he said.

The finished project is meant to be functional — to deliver furniture to clients under all weather conditions — and serve as a rolling calling card for his business.

This is Fisher’s second classic vehicle. He also has a 1955 Ford panel van.

But he advises his clients that if they see him and wave, not to be offended if he doesn’t acknowledge them at the time.

“Driving an old vehicle demands more concentration than a modern one. If I don’t wave back it’s because I have my hands firmly clasping the steering wheel.”

It isn’t Hyundai’s least expensive vehicle yet, but it soon may be. In some markets, Hyundai has already discontinued the Accent, its current five-door subcompact hatchback, giving the Venue the crown. But that hasn’t happened in North America — yet.

The Venue comes in four trim levels, with my tester, the Ultimate model, carrying a sticker price of $24,899.

The Venue is aimed at the urban first-time buyer, and it appeals to that group with a budget-friendly price. Despite its diminutive dimensions, its boxy body contains ample room for friends and cargo.

Headroom is a generous 1,000 millimetres in the front and 980 mm in the back. Legroom is 1,050 front and 870 mm back, with passenger interior volume pegged at 2,602 litres.

My tester had the Ultimate trim level — the fanciest — with premium items more commonly found in luxury brands. The interior is simple, uncluttered and logically arranged.

Comfort items that I didn’t expect include a heated steering wheel, power sunroof, push-button start and climate control.

The rear seatbacks fold 60/40 and the cargo floor has two positions. Cargo capacity is 335 litres with the seats up and 1,148 with them down.

The infotainment system consists of an eight-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability. The menus were easy to decipher and the system response time was good.

Technophiles will appreciate Hyundai’s BlueLink connected vehicle system, which allows users to access some functions — such as remote vehicle lock or unlock, remote start and remote climate control via their smartphone.

The system even has an automatic collision notification function that will call for emergency services in case of a crash.

My tester had navigation built-in, but lesser trims don’t offer that feature.

There is only one engine available, a 1.6-litre four cylinder producing 121 horsepower and 113 pound-feet of torque.

A manual transmission is available — but only in the base model. Every other trim gets a continuously variable transmission).

Power is delivered to the front wheels only — there is no all-wheel-drive option. As if to compensate, drivers can choose a Snow option along with Normal and Sport modes.

Let’s be frank, that last mode is more optimistic than fact. If you do choose Sport, the engine rpms go up, but you don’t really go faster.

If performance is what you’re after, you really should consider the Kona, the Venue’s bigger brother.

Fuel economy is 8.0 litres per 100 km in the city and 7.0 on the highway.

Compared with the Nissan Kicks, another subcompact SUV, power output and fuel consumption are similar.

With a 2,520-mm wheelbase and a 5.1-metre turning radius, the Venue is refreshingly nimble in the city. Unfortunately, the short wheelbase also results in a choppy ride on rough roads.

Apart from premium touches in the cabin, the Ultimate also impresses with its safety suite.

You get forward collision-avoidance assist (with automated emergency braking), lane-departure warning with lane-keeping assist, driver-attention warning, blind-spot collision warning with lane-change assist and rear cross-traffic warning.

While these features have become more common of late thanks to trickle-down effect of technology, it is the first time an entry-level model (albeit the highest trim in the line) has been so equipped.

With certain models, the Venue contrasts its entry-level stigma with a trendy/hip vibe, with eye-catching two-tone paint schemes and flashy wheels.

The Venue might be inexpensive to start. It can even be plain. But dress it up and you can go to town — and that’s the point.

In a space of days, we’ve gone from confronting COVID-19 to confronting the effects of racism and discrimination throughout our society.

We’ve seen how physical and verbal abuse damages and ends lives. But the movement on the streets, online and among work communities is bringing attention to how quiet behaviour and attitudes — intentional, thoughtless, or unknowing and unaware — can cause similar and often hidden harm.

A couple of weeks ago, we were talking about how the pandemic shutdowns provided an opportunity to reorder the world intentionally as part of the post-health-crisis restart. Many people saw that we could use the reopening of economies to address major problems and concerns faced by society and the world.

The restrictions exposed the cracks in our society, the fractures among our families, and the flaws in many of our systems. When so many parts of the world shut down, the weaknesses in how our lives are structured could no longer be avoided. Domestic abuse, mental health, homelessness, lack of support for seniors, young adults and young families, and the precarious nature of much work deemed essential yet done by some of the most poorly paid among us — these problems have long existed but are usually plastered and painted over, like mould in a building.

It took closing businesses, schools and offices, a nosediving economy, and hospitals and health-care workers standing by for a potential flood of COVID-19 cases such as Italy, France, Seattle and New York City saw to make us stop and pay attention.

And when we did, the problems stared right back at us.

As the pandemic unfolded, some problems were acknowledged. Some were temporarily addressed. Some employers of essential services topped up the wages of their front-line workers. Governments have stepped in with emergency-response programs to help individuals, businesses, non-profit agencies and industries. Changes to how work is conducted were mandated to keep people safe.

Those are only the problems that became most obvious when the shutdown occurred. With time, the existence of other problems — as persistent, but long shoved deeper into the flawed structure of our society — have emerged.

As many of the protesters have noted over the last couple of weeks, Canada has its own shameful past regarding racism. We carry the infamy of past harms — smallpox-infected blankets distributed to Indigenous peoples, residential schools, the segregation of black children in Ontario schools in the 1800s, the Komagata Maru, the turning away of non-white, non-Christian refugees during the Second World War, Saskatoon’s “starlight tours,” whereby city police dropped off intoxicated First Nations membersway out in the countryside to “walk it off,” even in deep winter … and the list goes on.

But just as the past few months have exposed other unpleasant truths about Canadian society, they have also revealed that racism resides just below Canadian society’s polite surface.

The recent attacks on people of Asian heritage in the Lower Mainland, the shooting of Chantel Moore, the beating of Chief Allan Adam and the death of Regis Korchinski Paquet belie the lies we tell ourselves. These are overt acts. They’re easier to spot and address.

The people whose attitudes have silently seeped into society for years rarely make the news. Those attitudes are much harder to expose and change. Whether we’re aware of and acknowledge our biases and prejudices or are oblivious to them, the harm we cause with them is just as real. Nobody has a right to make others feel unsafe and unwelcome in the communities they call home, the workplaces they are part of, the schools they attend, and the professions they contribute to.

Now that these uncomfortable truths are in the open, enough is enough — it’s time to deal with them and make a better world. For all peoples.

Since 1958, there have been 140 lunar missions, some intended to encircle the moon, others to land on it. Roughly half failed on lift-off or in flight, and nearly all of the remainder were, for the most part, trial runs aimed at developing more reliable technologies.

The issue revolves around diminishing marginal returns, the idea being that the more often you attempt a venture, relatively speaking the less you stand to gain.

That wouldn’t be true if all of the moon-shots so far had failed. In that case, it would still be worth another try.

But six manned missions (all American) have landed on the surface and returned safely. What is to be gained by a seventh, considering the miserable failure rates to date?

It’s been suggested that the moon could be mined for minerals that might in turn be processed on site as fuel for missions further afield.

No doubt one day this might be practical. But by 2024? Not a chance.

This is merely another placeholder in case Congress shuts down the space program completely.

The more obvious target is Mars. A recent stream of data from orbiters and landers, as well as Earth-based telescopes, has shown that without question water remains on that planet. Most of it will be underground — the atmosphere has burned off to such a degree that liquids don’t survive long on the surface.

Even so, there are photographs of water trickling down the sides of craters in the polar region.

To date, the robot landers sent to Mars have been miserably limited in nature. Their ability to search beneath the surface extends to only a few centimetres.

Clearly, that won’t do. If there is life on the red planet — the main reason for going there — it is likely to be far underground, possibly in subterranean caverns.

But the rovers sent to Mars have no chance of reaching these. At best they can test for atmospheric gases that might, conceivably, suggest the presence of living organisms.

And the emphasis here is on “conceivably.” There are numerous alternate explanations that skeptics will point to.

We’ve been conducting radio searches across various sectors of the galaxy since the late 1950s, looking for signs that someone is out there. So far, we’ve found nothing. Not that this has disheartened SETI researchers, who like NASA, need an excuse to stay in business.

The only realistic means of proving we are not alone in the universe is to visit the one planet in the solar system that has both a history of life-sustaining conditions, and which is within the reach of a manned expedition (if only just).

There is no question about the difficulties or risks involved. Given current rates of acceleration, it will take a ship about seven months to reach Mars, and the same to get back.

That’s a long time in a gravity-less environment. You could perhaps spin the ship to create the equivalent of gravity, as was done with the fictional Soviet spacecraft Leonov in the movie 2010.

But no-one knows the effect this would have on the human body over an extended period.

Then there is an unavoidable wait of 18 months on the planet’s surface until the Earth orbits back into the proper position. But the average temperature is -63 C, and radiation levels (again due to the thin atmosphere) are far above the lethal level. We’re talking mammoth hazmat suits.

Nevertheless, if we’re going to face the risks that manned space travel involves, we might as well do so for a purpose worth pursuing. Proof that we are not alone (and I’m betting that’s what such a mission would show), is the only purpose that meets this test.

According to the Conference Board of Canada, this country earns an “A” for its high-school completion rate, and ranks second out of 16 peer countries.

However, you might feel you are facing more uncertainties in the current climate than normal, so this is a good time for both some good news and some not-so-good news about what the future might hold, career-wise.

article continues below

But first, the bad news. You’d be justified in some level of anxiety about the future if you have plans never to darken the doorway of some kind of classroom again.

Recent graduates who enter the labour force straight out of high school are not faring as well as previous generations. That’s partly because 88 per cent of working-age Canadians have already graduated from high school and the competition for jobs which require only high school graduation is fierce.

The better news is that Canadian high-school graduates who pursue some level of post-secondary education or training do much better financially in the long run.

But as a Grade 12 grad, you probably already know all that. The somewhat more hopeful news is that baby boomers now make up Canada’s largest demographic group, and many are nearing retirement.

According to Statistics Canada, the baby-boomer generation made up almost 26 per cent of the population in 2018. And by 2024, one in five Canadians will be 65 or older.

That means many job opportunities could become available for younger Canadians who still have all or most of their careers ahead of them.

That’s an encouraging prospect for this year’s Grade 12 grads, but just as important as increasing job availability will be, according to the Conference Board of Canada, the kind of flexibility that some form of post-secondary education offers.

If current trends continue, Canadians can expect to hold as many 15 jobs, sometimes on different career paths and sometimes as variations of the original career direction.

A survey of 4,000 Canadians in September and October last year found that only six per cent of people have held just one job in their career, while 16 per cent said that they had already held more than 10.

Times have changed since previous generations posted a qualification and then worked in the same career all their lives. Job security, benefits and pensions defined their decision not to branch out.

So the not-so-good news for high school grads who think it’s all over is that their education is not over by far.

There is a growing consensus among employers that high-school completion is simply the prerequisite, a first step to post-secondary education of some kind.

A post-secondary qualification of some kind, even if it does not apply specifically to a job, is now deemed essential to success in a wide variety of labour-market opportunities.

Again, according to StatCan and other people who keep track of employment trends, most Canadians don’t think they will stay in the same line of work for their entire career.

In a survey of more than 1,000 people, nearly 73 per cent said that they do not expect to remain in the same profession for life. The most common reasons people gave for changing career paths range from discovering a new opportunities they have become passionate about (35 per cent), becoming bored/disillusioned with their original work (24 per cent), and a variety of setbacks, real or imagined, such as lack of advancement and cutbacks in times like these that result in layoffs (19 per cent).

That at least takes some pressure off the immediate decision to commit to a lifelong career direction.

Beyond that, there is a long lineup of notable people, too many to mention here, who did not discover what they really wanted to do until somewhat later in life.

Andrea Bocelli began singing opera when he was 34 and Martha Stewart was 35 when she started her catering business in a friend’s basement. She was 42 when her first book of recipes was published.

J.K. Rowling was a divorced mother on public assistance before she created Harry Potter at age 35, and the list goes on.

None of this has anything to do with being a “late bloomer.” It is simply illustrative of the fact that the decisions that you, as a newly certificated Grade 12 graduate, make now might, or more likely might not, lead to a lifelong career.

But with some post-secondary qualifications, the variety of opportunities is probably better than ever before.

Obviously, I was worried about risks, and wanted to make the final decision with caution. As eager and excited as I was, and still am, to reopen parts of our lives and “our bubbles” to include other people, there is a leery feeling in doing so.

At first, I chatted with parents asking their thoughts about schools reopening and if they were going to send their kids. I’ll admit I felt a little outnumbered, as each parent I spoke with had no intention of sending their kids back to school. I was even wondering if was making the right decision.

I don’t think there is a right or wrong answer here, it’s about personal preferences and family circumstances. This is one of those topics that we need to respect people’s decisions and not try to sway them to stand with us.

We all need to make the best decisions for our families. Also, as schools are operating within a smaller capacity and limiting student numbers, it is actually great that there are some families who are willingly keeping their children home.

It’s been a couple of weeks since schools have reopened, and there have been many children returning to school. I wasn’t alone. At one point I pictured an empty school with my daughter sitting in a class with only her teacher.

My daughter has been in school twice a week and spends other days in child care with a small group of kids. This experience has been extremely positive, and she is almost an entirely new child. She comes home beaming with excitement and happiness. Honestly, her reaction to these outlets opened my eyes to the effects a couple of months in quarantine had on her.

I am grateful to the schools and child-care centres that are opening and offering children the support, activities and mental stimulation they need and crave.

Before sending my daughter to school, we talked about how things might be different and what she could expect. I was worried the changes might be hard to adjust to. There were news stories and letters sent to parents all addressing this.

When my daughter came home the first day, she didn’t mention any of it. Her updates were on her teacher, her friends, and what they were learning. This was another reminder to me on how resilient children are.

My daughter took the school bus for the first time in months and told me how great it was. I had to nearly pry it out of her that she has to use hand sanitizer to board and that the first few rows need to remain empty to give the bus driver space.

I found this interesting because as adults I think we are often focussing on what the changes are going to be and how they will affect us.

Interestingly, there are some things in place that my daughter did point out, such as having to wash her hands before and after she eats. Which is something we should all do, all the time. If this is a new practice that gets drilled into us a little bit more, it’s a good thing.

Many of us are starting to experience the opportunities of going back to school or returning to work, and there will be some big changes in doing so.

At my daughter’s school, she said there are arrows on the floor now, similar to grocery stores. This is something that I think we will continue to see in more places. I remember the first time I saw this on social media and, honestly, I didn’t think it would happen here. It goes to show how fast we are able to implement practices that keep people safe and how quickly we can all adapt to them.

Teachers have now seen their duties multiply, with not only educating children in the classroom, but creating and facilitating online learning, and then the added responsibilities of ensuring the students are adhering to physical distancing. It’s no easy task, and I want to thank all teachers, particularly my daughter’s teacher for stepping up to the challenge.

Chamber of Commerce and the Thriving Orcas, Thriving Communities Coalition (composed of a number of coastal communities’ chambers of commerce) warned that coastal communities are on the brink of extinction because they rely on recreational fishing, which is in jeopardy.

Part of their proposed strategy to protect the orca and the chinook salmon — and their livelihoods — is “predator control.”

But just which predator is it that needs to be controlled? Ironically, two other reports released the same day made it clear; the chief predator is us. The first was a report from NatureServe Canada and the Nature Conservancy of Canada on the crisis facing endemic species — species that are found only in Canada. The second, released by the Sierra Club of B.C., was a report from three independent scientists on the state of B.C.’s old-growth forests.

The endemic species report identified 308 of them, most being vascular plants and invertebrates (bugs and slugs, if you like). In B.C. we have 105 of these endemic species, 76 of which are unique to B.C. (the rest overlap with other provinces or the United States), with many found only on Vancouver Island, Haida Gwaii and other islands. Ten of them are “critically imperilled” and 13 are “imperilled.” But this is only a small part of the picture.

There are more than 50,000 species of plants and animals in B.C., according to the Royal B.C. Museum — more than in any other province. Of them, 1,807 species are at risk of extinction, according to an opinion piece in The Narwhal last year by a group of prominent academics, most from B.C., who conduct research on endangered species. Overall, 784 species present in B.C. are “red-listed,” meaning they are extirpated, endangered, or threatened in B.C.

The lead researcher on the third report, on old-growth forests, was Dr. Rachel Holt, a conservation biologist and the principal of Veridian Ecological Consulting, based in Nelson. In the past she has served as vice-chair of the B.C. Forest Practices Board.

Shockingly, she and her colleagues found that “many old-growth management areas, created to protect old-growth forests, do not actually contain old forest,” but that “government information was either misleading or not making it out to the public,” hence their independent report. They agree with the information on the website of B.C.’s Old Growth Strategic Review (due to report about now) that old-growth forests comprise about 23 per cent of forested areas in B.C.

But the bulk of this old-growth forest, they write, is not the iconic old growth with big trees that we think of when we hear the term “old growth.” Instead, they report, “the vast majority of this forest (80 per cent) consists of small trees,” including “black spruce bog forests in the northeast, subalpine forests at high elevation and low-productivity western red cedar forests on the outer coast.”

In fact, they note: “Sites with the potential to grow very large trees cover less than three per cent of the province,” and of this small amount, only about three per cent is old forest. Large tree old-growth forest ecosystems, they say, “are almost extinguished and will not recover from logging.”

And yet, they note “little human effort is tasked with protecting old forest values, while much is focused on harvesting.” Similarly, the endangered species researchers note “B.C. is still one of the only provinces in Canada without legislation dedicated to protecting and recovering species at risk.”

The harsh reality is that communities that rely on the over-exploitation of natural systems such as old-growth forests or salmon fisheries, or that are affected by the actions of others that have seriously damaged those ecosystems, are indeed threatened with extinction, because their natural-resources base is heading for extinction.

So when we talk about predator control, let’s be clear what predator we are talking about. We are the planet’s apex predator, and so the predator we need to control is us. Because as the 19th-century Duwamish elder, Chief Seattle, is recorded saying: “We are part of the web of life, and whatever we do to the web of life, we do to ourselves.” We forget that wisdom at our peril.

thancock@uvic.caDr. Trevor Hancock is a retired professor and senior scholar at the University of Victoria’s School of Public Health and Social Policy.","Several years ago two American economists, Anne Case and Angus Deaton — the latter a Nobel Prize winner — made a startling observation: The overall death rate among middle-aged American whites had been increasing in recent years. This ran counter to the general trend of decreasing death rates in America in the 20th century and was opposite to the trend for middle-aged African Americans.

As they dug into the data, they found the increase in deaths was almost entirely found among those without a bachelor’s degree and was mostly due to three factors: suicide, drug overdoses and alcoholic liver disease. They labelled these the “deaths of despair,” a label that stuck. Clearly, something was going badly wrong among working-class white Americans.

article continues below

In their new book Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism, they provide an in-depth analysis of these diseases of despair. It is a story, they write, “of lives that have come apart and have lost their structure and significance.” It is a story “of worse jobs with lower wages; of declining marriage; and of declining religion.”

While they recognize there have been changes in values and social norms that have contributed to the breakdown, they focus on the “external forces that have eaten away the foundations that characterized working-class life as it was half a century ago.”

These include declining wages — down 13 per cent betweeen 1979 and 2017, while increasing overall nationally by 85 per cent; low rates of job creation for those without a degree and “worse jobs” — part-time, out-sourced, insecure, with no sense of belonging or pride.

The creation of worse jobs is made possible in part by the low level of unionization in the U.S. The Bureau of Labour Statistics reported 10.3 per cent of wage and salary workers were union members in 2019, down from 20.1 per cent in 1983. For comparison, OECD data for 2018 show rates for the five Nordic countries highlighted below ranged from 92 per cent in Iceland to 49 per cent in Norway; it is 26 per cent in Canada.

Case and Deaton note: “Deterioration in job quality and detachment from the labour force bring miseries over and above the loss of earnings.” For one thing, “men without prospects do not make good marriage partners.” Moreover, they note, communities deteriorate; as wages decline, jobs are lost and businesses close, the revenues needed to provide services such as schools, parks and libraries decline.

Add to that “the loss of meaning, of dignity and of self-respect that come with the loss of marriage and of community,” and you have a recipe for disaster.

Behind all this, I think, run two broad themes: The cult of individualism in the United States that downplays the importance of community and the collective, and neo-liberal economics, rooted in individualism and in a cynical disregard for people, prioritizing profits and the enriching of the wealthy.

Contrast this with the five Nordic countries, which ranked in the top 10 in the World Happiness Report every year since 2013, occupying the top three spots for three of the past four years. America, in comparison, ranked 18th in 2019. A chapter in the 2020 report is devoted to what makes the Nordic countries exceptional.

In essence, it’s a story of coming together, not coming apart. In general, the Nordic countries provide “easy access to relatively generous welfare benefits,” while “the labour market is regulated to avoid employee exploitation.” They also have high-quality governments and public institutions, with, in particular, a high quality of democracy, and as a result governments are trusted.

Other factors include low levels of inequality, a high sense of autonomy and freedom, and high levels of social trust and cohesion. In short, the Nordic countries have found a recipe for success, and it shows in the fact that on average they have four years more healthy life expectancy than the U.S.

America, it seems, has lost touch with the philosophy of one of its founders, Thomas Jefferson, who wrote in 1809 that “the care of human life and happiness and not their destruction is the first and only legitimate object of good government.” Creating despair among the poor while enriching the elites is utterly inconsistent with this view. Time for a rethink.

Can we institute effective public health measures that allow for economic growth?","It appears the COVID-19 outbreak is receding, at least for now. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control reported on May 21 that “most regions have reported very few cases, deaths and hospitalizations.”

However, that might be only a temporary relief. So far, the outbreak has been largely confined, at least in its most lethal form, to the northern hemisphere.

article continues below

That was to be expected. Coronaviruses, flu among them, are often a winter phenomenon. It may be the virus is vulnerable to ultraviolet light that tends to be more prominent in the summer months.

But when winter returns to our hemisphere, are we in for a second round? Many experts believe so.

In that event, what should our policy be, and who should enunciate it? One explanation for the unprecedented measures employed so far has been that this was an emergency, the full consequences of which could not immediately be known. Extraordinary steps were therefore fully justified.

Hopefully, if the outbreak reappears in the fall, we will have better data to calibrate our response, and possibly a vaccine — though many experts believe the latter to be either improbable, or of limited value. The effectiveness of some flu vaccines has fallen below 20 per cent.

Yet the issue remains, who decides how such a recurrence should be handled. And this question grows in magnitude when we consider that decisions taken in the more prosperous northern hemisphere may devastate the southern half of the globe.

Winter is just now approaching that region. Africa and Middle and South America look especially vulnerable (New Zealand and Australia might escape the worst effects because both are islands. That might be one reason Vancouver Island has been less hard hit than parts of the mainland.)

You can begin to see a picture of what may happen if you look at the current death tolls per million population. In several northern countries, the fatality rates are in the hundreds per million.

There are some exceptions. China reports very low figures, but there are good reasons to disbelieve these numbers.

In contrast, many African and South American countries are so far reporting figures at or close to single digits. As I write this, Paraguay stands at 11 deaths per million population, Venezuela 10, Egypt 6.9, South Africa 6.4, Sudan 2.9, French Guiana 1.

Most of these are Third World countries. You can’t expect their reporting to be precise.

Yet what happens if these numbers climb to the levels experienced in Britain (552), Italy (544), France (424) and Belgium (inexplicably 815)? Brazil, with its huge, densely populated cities, is already in trouble.

How will we handle this? By offering those governments more foreign aid? Certainly.

However, most Western nations have gone heavily into debt to deal with their own crises. In the midst of a panic-inducing epidemic, could there ever be sufficient resources to aid two entire continents whose populations approach 2.5 billion?

Given the success of public health experts such as B.C.’s Dr. Bonnie Henry in limiting the outbreak, this may appear an ungenerous question. But if, as many experts have predicted, COVID-19 makes a comeback in the fall, should we continue using the same policies to handle the crisis? For these measures have wider implications.

Difficult as it is to assimilate in the midst of a pandemic, the United Nations has warned that “hundreds of thousands of children could die this year due to the global economic downturn sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, and tens of millions more could fall into extreme poverty as a result of the crisis.”

This would undercut many of the gains made in reducing world poverty over the past two decades.

The International Monetary Fund has said that as a result of the COVID lockdown, “the world economy will experience the worst recession since the Great Depression.” Some economists are fearful it could last a decade or more.

And it has been argued that a full-scale outbreak in Africa or South America, accompanied by economic shutdowns, could lead to a flood of refugees from these continents that might swamp neighbouring health systems.

Can we institute effective public health measures that allow for economic growth? At the very least, shouldn’t there be a full-scale public discussion about this?

Bob Plecas, a retired deputy minister in the B.C. government, has offered a solution on these pages that, for what it’s worth, I think makes sense.

Plecas points out that if we want broader considerations given a hearing, then the proper venues to construct future policies are the federal and provincial cabinets. There you have ministers representing small businesses, the tourism industry, forestry, municipal government and so on, all sectors of the economy under extreme pressure.

You also have foreign-affairs staff who can speak to the implications in poorer countries.

Certainly the advice of public-health staff will play a central part in that analysis. But a wider range of voices must be heard if we are to avoid the kinds of disasters predicted by the UN and others.

charla@makola.bc.caCharla Huber is the director of communications and Indigenous relations for M’akola Housing Society.","I’ve spent a lot of time researching Indigenous employee recruitment and retention, and bias is something that continually comes up. A common response is employers and management teams need to work toward identifying their own biases, before things can improve for Indigenous employees.

Bias doesn’t just affect Indigenous people — it affects us all. In some cases, we are oppressed and others the oppressors. It can be uncomfortable to look within ourselves to identify our own biases, but if we don’t, nothing will change.

article continues below

Biases comes up all the time. We all have them. We need to understand that some biases we carry knowingly, and others are drawn on subconsciously. Sometimes bias can be displayed loudly and other times its underlying.

“We all grow up here and we are bombarded by millions of messages, many of which are upheld by institutions and it’s impossible to not be influenced,” Janice Abbott, CEO of Atira Women’s Resource Society, explained, adding these messages can lead to racism, sexism, misogyny, ageism, ableism and heterosexism.

Like most flaws, it is easier to identify bias in others than in ourselves, but it’s important for everyone to take a moment and think about it even if it is uncomfortable.

“Too many of us are way too committed to the idea that we are awesome and unwilling to reflect on our own biases,” said Abbott. “And while we may not choose to admit we have biases, we mostly know they exist. Basically, we have to want to change and then understand it’s a life-long journey with stumbles, and so it requires our absolute commitment.”

I recently took an Indigenous cultural safety course that had a few exercises on stereotypes and bias that I found challenging. One of these exercises was a list of stereotypes I was asked to sort into categories of different demographics. I had a hard time and felt awful because I knew what stereotypes they wanted me to link with individual groups, but I couldn’t actually force my mouse to connect them together. Right under the exercise was a statement saying it was meant to be uncomfortable.

We can be biased of people for many reasons that have nothing to do with race. Bias can include making assumptions about age, education, income, family composition, gender and sexual orientation. Bias is a shortcut our brain takes to process the millions of messages we are exposed to that Abbott mentioned. Not all shortcuts are good, and I think it could make a world of difference if we take a second to pause and assess some of these shortcuts.

Our bias makes snap judgments on how people look and behave, often resulting in unfortunate outcomes.

A recent example is the woman in New York’s Central Park calling 911 on a man who was bird-watching and who asked her to follow the park’s guidelines and put her dog on leash. When the conversation turned to a verbal dispute, the man started filming and the woman called 911 stating: “There is an African American man threatening my life.”

The story is disheartening, because in the video it appears the woman is stating the man is African American because she is hoping to garner a specific type of reaction, which could be deadly for the man. The video has spread worldwide.

While this is an example from the United States, we need to remember things like this happen here, too. During my conversation with Abbott, she raised a very important point, one that I am not sure we as Canadians think about.

“Being Canadian, we are often told that we are less racist, kinder, more accepting than other people,” Abbott said, explaining this as a bias we are taught to be true. “So we think we’re good and we’re shocked when it turns out the Amy Coopers are Canadian. Who wants to be less bad at something that is evil anyway? Is that our bar?”

Abbott noted that bias begins in our homes, and as we get older, we are exposed to bias through our peer groups and institutions. If we acknowledge our own biases and address them, we can reduce the biases that we pass on to others.

Mindlessness, on the other hand, is not intended as a pejorative term but simply describes a state of being unmindful or heedless.
Mindlessness is toxic for a democracy.
Interestingly, most academic articles about mindfulness relate mindlessness to an absence of emotional intelligence.","Not to rush to a generalized conclusion, but the COVID-19 pandemic has drawn a clear line between both the concepts and practices of “mindfulness” and “mindlessness.”

That’s not just about existing divisions in our society, but is more about those upon whom we rely upon for leadership and guidance in a time of crisis and upon whom the political, social and economic stability of our country’s future rests.

article continues below

That guidance and leadership influences the rest of us and our behaviour for better of worse.

“Mindfulness” gets a bad rap as some kind of hippy-dippy wannabe Zen Buddhism practice, but in fact mindfulness simply refers to a state of active, open attention to the present, the ability to live and accept the real world.

As we observe the words and actions of a variety of leaders during a crisis such as the COVID pandemic, the distinction becomes clearer.

To live mindfully is to live in the moment and to reawaken oneself and others to the present, as opposed to dwelling on the past.

Philosophers like Soren Kierkegaard describe this state as “existentialism,” meaning, in unpretentious terms, what happens when an individual is continually faced with diverse possibilities from among which the existent (i.e., the human individual) must make a selection to which he/she must then commit.

Big word, simple meaning.

Dr. Bonnie Henry is an example of a softly spoken person who simply relates the facts of the situation. She is a model of mindfulness. As Marshall McLuhan might have put it, she is both the medium and the message.

Mindfulness is the ability to link cause and effect or even action and consequence socially, economically, personally and politically.

Mindlessness, on the other hand, is not intended as a pejorative term but simply describes a state of being unmindful or heedless.

Mindlessness is toxic for a democracy.

As Costica Bradatan, Professor of Humanities at Texas Tech University wrote recently in the New York Times: “Democracy is for the Gods and it should be no surprise that humans cannot sustain a democracy,” adding that “world history, for the most part, is the story of excessively mindless self-assertive individuals in search of various sceptres.”

Bradatan points out that even in a steadily failing once-upon-a-time democracy such as the United States of America, it doesn’t help matters that a self-serving individual, despite all flags or warning, has been enthroned as leader. Others seem only too eager to mindlessly submit to his mindlessness.

After all, mindlessness is easier than thinking.

Interestingly, most academic articles about mindfulness relate mindlessness to an absence of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence, unlike linguistic intelligence, logical or mathematical intelligence, musical intelligence, kinesthetic body intelligence or spatial-visual intelligence explains why the people we tend to admire and identify with most comfortably in life display other-centredness and kindness rather than cruelty in their interactions with others.

Mindlessness often dissipates with maturity, and sometimes, to the dismay and frustration of the mindful, is unintentionally common among young (and sometimes older) emerging minds. “Good judgment,” as the saying goes, “comes from experience and too often experience comes from bad judgment.”

All well and good, but what does any of this have to do with individual and cultural reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic?

Some people, it seems, are approaching the pandemic risks mindfully, while others, frustrated because they can’t gather in groups or do the familiar self gratifying things that provide them with immediate short-term pleasure, resist experienced fact-based advice mindlessly.

In this time of COVID-19, many of us can relate to the annoyance of having experienced a loss of control that has been replaced by a great sense of vulnerability for ourselves and others, along with a whirlwind of challenging emotions, including fear, guilt and grief.

In some ways, it feels like revisiting the uncertainties of adolescence, because with so many unknowns, we are left with no choice other than to live existentially in the present moment, one day at a time, which isn’t so easy for most adults.

Mindfulness then becomes an actual life-saving social imperative. The mindful are paying attention to present experiences with curiosity and compassion, and in doing so, learn to co-operate with experiences, rather than resisting or fighting them.

Simply being in denial about undeniable reality is mindlessness. Falling, as they say, feels like flying for a little while but then the illusion is brutally brought back to the inflexible uncompromising reality of landing “hard.”

As Bradatan concludes in his piece about the survival of a democracy through a crisis: “One element that is needed for democracy to emerge is a sense of humility,” and it seems reasonable to say that being mindful on behalf of our own safety and that of others during the COVID-19 crisis requires much more than a mere spoonful of humility.

What led to this trash talking, more of which in a moment, was the decision by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to begin a new life on Vancouver Island. Now I’m not sure that decision still holds — there’s been talk they might prefer Hollywood, a genuinely characterless backwater.

article continues below

But apparently, the thought of losing what it calls “one of the world’s glamorous couples” was more than the paper could stomach.

Hence we get this: the “relatively young couple seem anxious to escape the restrictions of the UK monarchy … so picking … underpopulated Vancouver Island, with fir trees in every direction, freezing winters and a brief six-week summer might seem understandable … in reality, it’s just plain weird. Instead of Lake Como they’ve got a rocky beach with grey skies overhead ... Have we Brits really upset the Duke and Duchess of Sussex so much they prefer the hum drum [sic] existence of downtown Victoria, with its limited choice of fine dining and trendy cafés?”

And: “If Canada is so fabulous, how come so many famous Canadians live elsewhere?”

Then again: “What cuisine has Canada given the world — apart from maple syrup, bacon and a disgusting dish called poutine, which consists of cheese curds, chips and brown sauce.”

Plus “The average age [Canadians] start drinking is 13 and there’s a huge alcohol problem — maybe it’s the lack of things to do.”

Actually, the country with a “huge alcohol problem” is Britain, where the locals down 20 per cent more per capita than we do.

So let’s turn this around. First off, I’m fairly confident the ex-royal couple fled Britain to get away from outfits such as the Daily Mail, famous for scantily clad “models” and bare-faced rumour-mongering.

As well, if Britain is so fabulous, how come so many Brits live abroad? According to the 2016 census, a third of Canadians list their ethnic origin as English or Scottish.

And sliming weather on Vancouver Island when you’re writing for a newspaper based in England, home to one of the dreariest climates on the planet, takes nerve. The U.K. has been blasted with unprecedented gale-force winds, torrential rain and flooding in recent weeks.

But let’s get to the heart of the matter. I assume the author of this hit piece, Janet Street-Porter, lives in London, where the paper is published. Though in passing, she confesses to having spent two weeks once upon a time on Gabriola Island, where “pooing in a composting toilet has scarred me for life.”

In any event, traffic in London is now so hellish, you have to pay a $20 fee just to drive into town. There are indeed fine dining establishments and trendy cafés, but you would need a bank loan to eat at one.

And don’t think of buying a house — average price $1.4 million for an ancient pile built in the 1800s, with lousy wiring and a kitchen the size of a broom closet. Even a one-bedroom apartment can set you back $3,000 a month in rent.

Mangy foxes roam the streets and even mangier pigeons decorate your parked car with droppings. That is, if you can find somewhere to park it in the first place.

By general agreement, London’s underground — the Tube — is dirty, smelly and crowded, perhaps the worst of its kind in Europe.

And the city’s crime rate, at 96 offences per thousand residents, is 10 times the level on Vancouver Island, and rising rapidly.

In short, life in a “characterless backwater” such as North Saanich is heaven compared with eking out an existence in the concrete jungle Street-Porter calls home.

However, if she cares to pay us a visit, I’m sure we can find her a place with an indoor toilet, something you still can’t count on in that Sceptred Isle.

Enjoy.

To my dear AP English students,

article continues below

I wanted to contact you and tell you that I have been thinking about you and your families this past week. The first two days were kind of a novelty-like snow days without snow. The weather was beautiful, the daffodils and cherry trees were blooming, and things were coming back to life after a long, dreary winter.

When we got the call Wednesday and then Thursday about school closing, the novelty gave way to anxiety and worry. How long will this last? Will my students be OK? Will my elderly parents weather this virus? Everything seems even more amplified now. If you switch on the television, you might think the world is ending.

But, it isn’t.

One of the interesting things about getting older is that I have seen a lot of different things come and go. I haven’t seen as much as my grandfather — who was born into the Greatest Generation and saw so much tragedy on a global scale in his lifetime. However, I am a history nerd and I know that what we are experiencing is not completely unprecedented, historically.

What is unprecedented is the 24/7 news and social-media coverage of what they are now calling a “pandemic.”

Words really do matter, and I guess that the word “pandemic” is accurate — though I find it fear inducing and not necessarily helpful in quelling anxiety or helping people remain calm. It is an interesting word and when I first heard it, I thought of Pan — the Greek god of shepherds and flocks, woods and fields. “Pan” also means bread in Spanish. My mind wandered to the thought, if only “pandemic” meant “bread for all.”

Of course, “pandemic” is more sinister that either of those — an epidemic disease that has spread to “all,” the Latin root of the word. What is happening is terrible on a global scale.

So why I am writing to you this discourse about the word “pandemic”? Well, as you know, because I have been your teacher since August, I am a word geek who thinks very philosophically about things and can go down rabbit holes with that kind of thinking on a regular basis.

But, it is mainly because I miss teaching you and seeing you and talking to you about everything that is going on in the world right now, seeing your faces to see if you are OK and gauging your emotions to see how you are processing all of this.

When I was looking at social media yesterday, I saw a post by a young man that I thought I would share with you. He said: “I imagine all the closures and cancellations give people a sense of ominousness. But it’s really an amazing act of social solidarity: We’re sacrificing so we can give nurses, doctor and hospitals a fighting chance. Start from there and hopefully, we can figure out the rest.”

I thought that was a wonderful way to think positively about our current situation.

One of the best things about “all” of us in this together, is that we are “all” in it together! We can look out for one another and take care of one another until the virus (I feel like if I say the actual name, it is like summoning Voldemort or something …) settles down and runs its course.

Because it will run its course.

Because this will be over at some point.

So … in the meantime, we have extra time! Extra time to spend with family. Extra time to sleep. Extra time to read. Extra time to play games. Extra time to enjoy the beautiful spring weather that I am sure is just around the corner. Extra time to help others in need. Although isolation is not always fun, extra time is a tremendous gift!

So, even though for now, school and sports and public events have been cancelled, there are lots of things that are not cancelled!

Music is not cancelled!

Dancing is not cancelled!

Movies (at home) are not cancelled!

Conversations and discussions are not cancelled!

Reading is not cancelled!

Friendships are not cancelled!

Love is not cancelled!

Hope is not cancelled!

What we must cancel are fear, mass hysteria, too much screen time reading about the Virus that Should Not be Named, and the hoarding of toilet paper just to mention a few.

I hope you know that I am thinking of all of you during this time. I miss all of you and hope that you and your families are healthy and well.

I can’t wait to see you soon and get back to teaching you that “intricately patterned” masterpiece, my favourite novel in the entire world, The Great Gatsby. It truly is a wonder of a novel.

And, each of you is a “wonder,” and you are precious to me and so many others.

So, be safe, be reasonable and be kind.

And, lastly, WASH YOUR HANDS!"

This too shall pass. After winter, spring.

At least spring has been steadily creeping up on us. Birds have been gathering dried grass and twigs for nests. First leaves have lit up the Indian plum shrubs. The sun shines hot, even if the wind blows cold, with summer in the light and winter in the shade.

The days are lengthening. Blossom by blossom the spring has been unfolding, with snowdrops, crocuses, daffodils, and blooming quince and cherry trees.

Many of these signs are daylight and temperature dependent. They arrive with some consistency every year, with leeway of a week or three or four, as inevitable as the planet circles the sun. Yes, hold on — life will get warmer.

Other local signs of spring are less sure this year. The bass-note cruise-ship hoots and toots will be missing from Victoria’s springtime soundscape. Due to concerns about COVID-19, Transport Canada has banned boats and cruise ships carrying more than 500 people from docking at Canadian ports until July.

The 290 ship-visit season had been set to begin in Victoria April 3, with the arrival of the Grand Princess.

Almost 115 cruise-ship arrivals will not take place this spring — and almost 300,000 passengers they would have brought to the city won’t be visiting.

That’s not what Victoria city council had in mind last year when it passed a motion to limit the number of cruise ships allowed to dock in the city each year until the industry takes significant steps to be greener. It’s not what council had in mind in January when it passed a motion to possibly increase cruise ship waste-dumping fees in the region.

Yet the result will be the same. In James Bay this year, signs of spring will not include diesel exhaust from ships in port running their generators to power their facilities, the sound of those engines rumbling day and night, nor the usual cruise-related traffic.

And while the days grow longer and warmer and the cherry blossoms peak, then wane, local businesses and people who rely on tourism will feel a deep, lingering winter chill this year. The cancelled cruise visits alone could mean at least $50 million less economic activity in the region.

Government directives to postpone non-essential international travel, bans on non-Canadians entering the country from overseas, restrictions on where international flights can land, cancellation of large events and public gatherings, increased social distancing and self-isolation — these and other changes to how we go about our lives will delay the gearing up of activity and industry we normally see at this time of year.

An economic Lent is advancing, and a financial winter, with its hardscrabble, hunker-down discontent, is extending its reach into April, May and June.

No Times Colonist 10K run, provincials hockey, Capital City Comic Con, or performances will occur until further notice. The University of Victoria has cancelled many classes, with some courses switching to delivery methods that don’t involve in-person gatherings. Brick-and-mortar schools are closed indefinitely. Bars and pubs are shuttered, and restaurants are advised to apply the government’s social distancing directives.

It’s a crisis. But this too will pass. A month ago, health officials were hoping to eliminate the COVID-19 virus, much as happened after the 2003 SARS epidemic. Now, they’re seeking to slow its spread and delay its peak until after flu and cold season — all to relieve pressure on the health-care system, give health authorities time to prepare and give scientists time to develop a workable vaccine or find anti-viral medications that slow the virus’s advance.

They’ve accepted that the virus will eventually establish itself throughout populations around the world, much as influenza and cold viruses have.

We will adapt, one way or another.

No winter and no pandemic lasts forever. Spring — however we define it and by whatever signs we characterize — will come. What it will look like is another question.

It’s tough to do so because right now everything seems to funnel back to the worldwide pandemic.

There is a lot of uncertainty in our world right now and as we watch public spaces, businesses, and institutions close their doors to the public for the near future, it only reinforces what we are going through is real.

article continues below

When I was born, my Grandma Bessie was around 70 years old. She was always an old grandma who was very short with brown eyes and curly white hair.

When I was too sick to go to school, I would go to my grandma’s house and watch The Price is Right and make boats out of egg cartons and make them float in her bathtub.

My grandmother was very frugal and made sure not to be wasteful. Every time I would visit her at her apartment, my Grandma Bessie would give me a small handful of pennies. For my birthdays and on Christmas I would get a bag with a small collection of pennies inside.

As I got older, I realized that every time my Grandma Bessie received a penny in her change, she would put it away for me. She had many grandchildren, and today, it makes me feel special that whenever she had a penny, she thought of me.

I did not have this realization until later in life. I remember being a very unimpressed 15-year-old one Christmas, unwrapping a bread bag with pennies and breadcrumbs in the bottom when my older brother was gifted movie passes.

My grandma lived during the Great Depression and it was an experience that really moulded the woman she became. When she was a young teenager, I think about 14 or 15, her parents told her they couldn’t afford to keep her in the home anymore and she would have to leave home and start taking care of herself financially.

Being sent out into the world on her own, she found work taking care of people with disabilities and making bombshells for the war. Making bombshells was something that haunted her for her entire life. She never escaped the guilt that she felt, even though her friends and family tried to comfort her and reminded her of her circumstances at the time.

Bessie searched for peace through religion and doing her best to be the kindest person she could. She lived to be 94 years old.

This experience shaped her frugal ways, her refusal to waste anything and her determination to ensure food never found its way into the bin. Valuing each and every penny she collected must fall into their, somewhere, too.

I was told about my grandmother’s experiences during the Great Depression many times over in my life. I always knew this happened to her, but I could never really comprehend how the world could turn upside down so fast.

Over these past few weeks, we’ve all seen it happen and our perceptions and thoughts have changed dramatically as we see how quickly things are happening now. We are living in a time of uncertainty. People are losing their jobs and self-employed people are losing contracts. There is no doubt that this is a hurdle for all of us.

There are many vulnerabilities right now that include our health, our finances and our families.

As a community we are working together toward social-distancing and flattening the curve. Scientists are working toward a vaccine.

I don’t know what the future holds. I hope that we can try to step outside of our own experiences and make sure that our friends, families and neighbours are being taken care of mentally, emotionally and financially.

There are bound to be many lessons we learn and experiences that shape who we become as we age. This is a reminder to us all that life can turn upside down at any moment. We need to find ways to be more understanding and compassionate, because there will always be someone having a harder time than us.

The young folks reading this are probably asking themselves: “What are pennies?”

If we did nothing, hundreds of thousands of Canadians, especially older people, might die and the health care system would be overwhelmed, jeopardizing the health of many other people with other health problems. Flattening the curve will reduce the peak of the epidemic, spreading it out over a longer period of time. This also buys us time to find treatment or a vaccine.

So around the world today and across Canada borders are closed, as are schools, universities, libraries, rec centres, cafés, pubs and many businesses, large and small. Our communities and societies have been brought to a halt, or at least to a dramatic slowdown, and our economies are in a tailspin.

But many might be concerned that the public-health and societal effort to contain COVID-19 comes at a huge cost to society, that it is triggering a global recession, that it might even lead to a depression. Could it even be the case that the social and economic disruption we create will kill or sicken more people than does the disease?

After all, the Great Depression in North America and Europe was a time of great misery and despair. Surely that was bad for health. Surprisingly, it seems that was not the case; in fact, the opposite was true.

A 2009 paper co-authored by a leading American social epidemiologist, Ana Diez Roux at the University of Michigan, examined life and death during the Great Depression.

They found “population health did not decline and indeed improved during the Great Depression of 1930-1933” and that death rates “decreased for almost all ages, and gains of several years in life expectancy were observed for males, females, whites and non-whites — with the latter group being the group that most benefited.”

This is not to say there are no ill-effects of a recession or depression. They note that among the six main causes of death, accounting for about two-thirds of all deaths in the 1930s, “only suicides increased during the Great Depression.” Today, at a time of industrial decay in some parts of the U.S., we have seen an increase in deaths from the “diseases of despair” — alcohol and drug use (especially opioids) and suicide — among lower-middle income middle-age men.

But contrary to our expectations, they note, “years of strong economic growth are associated with either worsening health or with a slowing of secular improvements in health.” Moreover, they added, this “was first noted decades ago, but was largely ignored until recently.”

The reasons for increased deaths during economic expansions, they report, include “increases in smoking and alcohol consumption, reductions in sleep and increases in work stress” as well as increases in “traffic or industrial injuries … [and] atmospheric pollution.”

As I have noted before, there are many businesses and many ways of making a profit that can harm health. Just recently, I reported that a joint WHO-UNICEF-Lancet Commission had identified commercial activities as one of the three greatest threats to children’s health, along with climate change and poverty; all are influenced by this COVID-19 recession.

Environmental scientists have already noted a dramatic reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions in China and Italy, and this will soon become worldwide. Indeed, Stanford University environmental resource economist Marshall Burke suggested in early March that the reduction in air pollution in China might have already saved more lives than the COVID-19 epidemic had cost.

We can already see the reductions in traffic on our local roads, which will not only reduce air pollution and carbon emissions but crashes and injuries.

If this goes on for months, as it might, we will likely see increasing need for government support for laid-off workers, strengthening support for some form of guaranteed income and/or shelter — basic requirements for health — is met. Coupled with that we can expect reduced demand for more “stuff,” as people adjust to lower incomes.

It might be that with this combination of reduced consumption and reduced environmental harm, coupled with societal commitment to ensuring the meeting of basic needs for all, we will find ourselves unintentionally creating the well-being economy we need in the 21st century.

COVID-19 is the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people and others cause illness in animals. Human coronaviruses are common. They are typically associated with mild illnesses, similar to the common cold.

article continues below

COVID-19 is a new disease that has not been previously identified in humans. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people, and more rarely, these can then spread from person to person through close contact.

There have been two other specific coronaviruses that have spread from animals to humans and which have caused severe illness in humans: SARS and MERS.

How worried should I be?

The illness caused by COVID-19 is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: an estimated one in five people who catch it needs hospital care, and in severe cases, infection can lead to death.

Older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.

According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe ailments might take three to six weeks to rebound. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed, but more than 60,000 already have recovered.

There are also ways to reduce your risk of catching it.

How likely am I to catch it?

The risk depends on where you are and whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in most places, the risk of becoming infected remains low. On Vancouver Island, for example, there have been eight cases, as of Monday.

Complying with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings helps to reduce the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

In B.C., the government is asking people who have been travelling overseas to self-isolate for 14 days and watch for symptoms. Gatherings and events of more than 250 people have been cancelled.

What symptoms should I look out for?

Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Some people have developed pneumonia in both lungs.

That said, those who are infected with COVID-19 might have little to no symptoms, and many symptoms are similar to those of a cold or flu, so you might not realize you have COVID-19.

It appears that it could take up to 14 days for symptoms to appear after a person is exposed to the virus.

What should I do if I feel sick?

If you are sick, the first thing you need to do is stay home, away from others, says provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry.

People experiencing symptoms such as a fever, dry cough or difficulty breathing are asked to contact their primary-care providers or call HealthLink B.C. at 811 to be assessed. People who require follow-up will be directed to call a testing clinic, where a triage nurse will reassess them to determine if an appointment for testing is needed.

Do I need to get tested?

Only if you are told to get one by your primary care provider or HealthLink B.C. Those who are symptom-free don’t have to be tested for COVID-19, even if they have been travelling abroad.

Isn’t the flu worse than COVID-19?

In terms of sheer numbers, influenza has a greater impact than the new coronavirus.

According to the World Health Organization, annual flu epidemics are estimated to result in about three million to five million cases of severe illness. Seasonal flu kills far fewer than one per cent of those infected.

For comparison, there were 142,539 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5,393 deaths as of Saturday. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is estimated to be between one and four per cent.

Both the flu and COVID-19 cause respiratory disease and spread the same way, via small droplets of fluid from the nose and mouth of someone who is sick. Influenza appears to transmit more efficiently, with people who are not yet sick being major spreaders of the disease.

However, COVID-19 appears to cause more severe disease than seasonal influenza. Because it is new, no one has immunity. That means more people are susceptible to infection. And unlike the flu, there are no vaccines or specific treatments for COVID-19. (However, clinical trials are underway and several vaccines are in development.)

How does the virus spread?

Coronavirus is transmitted via larger liquid droplets when a person coughs or sneezes. For that reason, the virus is not thought to be airborne — transmitted through particles floating in the air. However, you can become infected if you are in close contact and these droplets enter through the eyes, nose or throat.

It can be spread by touch if a person has used their hands to cover their mouth or nose when they cough. That’s why you should cough or sneeze into your arm, avoid shaking or touching hands, and wash your hands regularly.

You can also catch it by touching an object with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands. Again, wash your hands regularly.

Because it’s a heavier droplet, it only spreads about one metre through coughing or sneezing. It’s not clear how long the virus lasts on surfaces.

It is most likely to be transmitted by infected individuals to people they live with, spend time with in close indoor settings, or by sharing food.

Can you become sick from someone before they show symptoms?

Health officials still are investigating whether the virus can be transmitted to others if someone is not showing symptoms. Experts believe it is possible, but rare.

How can I keep from getting sick?

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry advises “doing all those things that we need to do at this time of the year to prevent transmissions of infections,” including cleaning hands regularly, covering your mouth with your sleeve, not touching your face and eyes, staying away from others and staying home if you’re sick.

Wash your hands, regularly and thoroughly, using soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand rub. Wash them for at least 20 seconds, and be sure to include your wrist, fingertips and between your fingers.

Practise social distancing, keeping at least one metre (three feet) away from others, especially anyone who is coughing or sneezing.

Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth. Your hands touch a lot of surfaces and can pick up viruses, which can then be transferred to your eyes, nose or mouth — where they can enter your body and make you sick.

Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a disposable tissue. Throw out the tissue immediately.

Stay away from COVID-19 hotspots — areas where the virus is spreading widely. There is a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in these areas.

Regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, and do not share food, drinks or utensils.

Should I wear a mask?

If you are sick, wearing a mask helps prevent you from passing on illnesses to other people.

If you are not sick, it might be less effective to wear a mask in the community.

What is social distancing?

It’s not forever, but provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry is asking people to distance themselves from others, at least a metre — about the distance that the novel coronavirus droplets spread through coughing or sneezing can travel.

If you are at a gathering of a few people, consider sitting in every second seat. Avoid hugging, kissing and shaking hands.

“Right now, we need to keep our hands to ourselves, keep our germs to ourselves,” Henry said. “Make it OK within our family groups and within our religious and social groups that we [greet one another] from a distance right now. We look people in the eyes. We smile in the same way that we have before.”

What is self-monitoring?

Self-monitoring means watching your health and the health of your children for symptoms such as fever, cough and difficulty breathing.

Anyone who self-monitors is asked to avoid crowded public spaces and places where you cannot easily separate yourself from others if you become ill. Individuals who are self-monitoring are allowed to attend and work in school and participate in regular activities.

I’ve been travelling — what should I do?

B.C. has asked anyone who has been out of the country to self-isolate.

Self-isolation means avoiding situations where you could infect other people to help prevent the spread of infections.

Stay at home and limit contact with others for 14 days. That means not going to work or school.

Monitor yourself daily for symptoms such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing for these 14 days. If you develop symptoms, call HealthLink B.C. (811) or speak with your health-care provider to discuss any need for testing and follow-up.

People who have self-isolated can return to normal activities after 14 days if they have not developed any symptoms.

If you’re concerned that you might have been exposed to the virus because you recently travelled to one of the affected areas — such as Washington state, Italy, China, or Iran — call your health-care provider, if you have one, or 811 to speak to a nurse who will help guide you through the process.

Can I still travel?

The federal governments have issued a global travel advisory, telling Canadians to avoid non-essential travel abroad.

Travel could be severely interrupted because many governments are imposing entry, exit and movement restrictions, the Foreign Affairs Department said. Canadians outside the country should consider an early return, it said.

To limit the spread of COVID-19, many countries have put in place travel or border restrictions and other measures such as movement restrictions and quarantines. Airlines have cancelled flights. New restrictions could be imposed with little warning. Your travel plans might be severely disrupted and you might be forced to remain outside of Canada longer than expected.

Contact your airline or tour operator to determine options for cancelling or postponing your trip.

The Government of Canada is advising that you avoid all travel on cruise ships due to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, until further notice.

Cruise passengers include travellers from around the world who might be arriving from areas with known or unknown spread of COVID-19.

The virus can spread quickly on board cruises due to the close contact between passengers. Older people and people with a weakened immune system or underlying medical condition are at a higher risk of developing severe disease.

Should I be stocking up on food?

The Canadian Public Health Agency recommends stocking up on non-perishable food items, so that you do not need to go shopping if you become sick or if there is a larger outbreak.

It is easier on the supply chain if people gradually build up their household stores instead of making large-scale purchases all at once. To do this, you can add a few extra items to your grocery cart every time you shop.

Some good options include easy-to-prepare foods such as dried pasta and sauce, canned soups and canned vegetables and beans. It’s also good to have extra pet food, toilet paper, facial tissue, feminine hygiene products and diapers, as applicable, on hand.

The reason for stocking up on these items is not necessarily because you will need to self-isolate. Having these supplies on hand will ensure you do not need to leave your home at the peak of the outbreak or if you become ill.

2018

Aug. 22: A New York court issues a warrant for the arrest of Huawei Technologies chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.

Dec. 1: Canadian authorities arrest Meng at Vancouver's airport after an extradition request from the Americans. The news becomes public on Dec. 5.

Dec. 6: China demands Canada release Meng and ""immediately correct the mistake"" officials made in arresting her. The Chinese say they were not briefed on the reasons for Meng's arrest. In Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Meng's case is part of an independent legal process with no outside political influence.

Dec. 7: Meng appears in a Vancouver court, where allegations of fraud are laid out. The U.S. alleges Meng misled American banks in a bid to get around American sanctions on Iran.

Dec. 8: Canada's ambassador to China, John McCallum, is summoned to a meeting with China's assistant foreign minister so the country can register complaints about Meng's arrest.

Dec. 9: China summons the American ambassador to China to lodge similar complaints about Meng's case and demand the U.S. rescind the order for her arrest.

Dec. 10: Chinese authorities arrest two Canadian men. Michael Kovrig, who was on leave from Global Affairs Canada, and entrepreneur Michael Spavor. Kovrig's arrest becomes public on Dec. 11. Spavor's becomes public on Dec. 12.

Dec. 11: Meng is released on $10 million bail. U.S. President Donald Trump tells Reuters that he would ""certainly intervene"" in Meng's case ""if I thought it was necessary"" to help forge a trade deal with China.

Dec. 12: China's foreign ministry says it has no information about Kovrig but says the organization he worked with — the International Crisis Group — was not registered in China, making its activities in the country illegal.

Dec. 13: Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, says the arrests of the two Canadians were plainly a response to Meng's arrest. China's foreign ministry says Kovrig and Spavor have been detained on suspicion of ""endangering national security.""

Dec. 14: Canadian officials are granted consular access to Kovrig, and McCallum meets with him in Beijing.

Dec. 16: Canadian diplomats in China are granted consular access to Spavor.

Dec. 20: Indictments unsealed in the United States allege two Chinese citizens targeted companies in Canada and around the world as part of a years-long hacking campaign to steal data.

Dec. 21: Kovrig's employer, the International Crisis Group, says he has not been given access to a lawyer while in custody. A source familiar with the conditions of Kovrig's detention says he is questioned three times a day and kept in a room with the lights on continuously. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland formally demands both men be let go, calling in a statement ""for their immediate release."" Similar statements come out from the United States, Britain and the European Union.

Dec. 24: China's foreign ministry calls out the U.S., Britain and EU, saying the trio should be condemning Canada for Meng's arrest.

2019

Jan. 3: At a news conference, China's prosecutor general Zhang Jun says Kovrig and Spavor ""without a doubt"" violated Chinese law. He says the investigation is also following the rule of law but doesn't provide more details about the allegations.

Jan. 7: The Prime Minister's Office says Trump has affirmed his respect for judicial independence. In a summary of a phone call between Trump and Trudeau, the PMO indicated the leaders discussed the high-profile U.S. extradition request — though Meng was not named — and agreed on the importance of respecting the independence of judges and the rule of law.

Jan. 9: China's envoy in Ottawa suggests Canada and its Western allies are white supremacists for calling for the release of two Canadians imprisoned last month by his country's communist government. Ambassador Lu Shaye makes the accusation in an op-ed in the Hill Times.

Jan. 14: Trudeau says he's very concerned to see China ""acting arbitrarily"" by applying the death penalty to a Canadian convicted of drug trafficking. He says Canada will do all it can to intervene on Robert Lloyd Schellenberg's behalf when a court in Dalian in northeastern Liaoning province announced it had given Schellenberg the death penalty after reconsidering his case.

Jan. 15: China expresses its ""strong dissatisfaction"" with Trudeau over his criticism of Schellenberg's sentence. Trudeau should ""respect the rule of law, respect China's judicial sovereignty, correct mistakes and stop making irresponsible remarks,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying says.

Jan. 16: The U.S. State Department says China's death sentence against Schellenberg is ""politically motivated."" A statement says U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Freeland spoke and ""expressed their concerns about the arbitrary detentions and politically motivated sentencing of Canadian nationals.""

Jan. 17: Ambassador Shaye says Canada's arrest of Meng was an act of ""backstabbing"" by a friend. Lu warns of ""repercussions"" if Canada bars the firm from its new 5G network for security reasons, as have three of its intelligence-sharing allies.

Jan. 18: Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale says the government's decision on whether to ban Huawei from being used in Canada's next generation 5G wireless network will not be influenced by threats of retaliation from China.

Jan. 22: China demands the U.S. drop a request that Canada extradite Meng. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Meng's case was out of the ordinary and Canada's extradition treaty with the U.S. infringed on the ""safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens.""

Jan. 23: Ambassador McCallum says there are strong legal arguments Meng can make to help her avoid extradition to the United States. Speaking to Chinese reporters a day earlier in the Toronto area, McCallum listed several arguments Meng's legal team can make in her defence.

Jan. 24: Trudeau dismisses calls to remove McCallum following his comments to Chinese reporters, saying such a change wouldn't help the two Canadians detained by Chinese authorities get home any sooner. Later, McCallum says he ""misspoke"" when he suggested detained Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou had a strong case to avoid extradition to the United States.

Jan. 25: McCallum tells StarMetro Vancouver it would be ""great for Canada"" if the United States drops its extradition request. ""We have to make sure that if the U.S. does such a deal, it also includes the release of our two people. And the U.S. is highly aware of that,"" he told the Star.

Jan. 26: McCallum resigns as ambassador to China at Trudeau's request.

Jan. 28: The U.S. Department of Justice formally levels criminal charges against Huawei, two subsidiaries and Meng. The charges, contained in two newly unsealed indictments, allege that Huawei misrepresented its ownership of a Hong Kong-based subsidiary to circumvent American sanctions against Iran. Furthermore, they say Huawei stole telecommunications technology, trade secrets and equipment from U.S. cellphone provider T-Mobile USA. Meng is charged with bank fraud, wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit both. In a statement, Huawei denied committing any of the violations cited in the indictment.

Jan. 29: The Canadian government says it has received a formal request for the extradition of Meng, who appears in a Vancouver court to change the people who are providing her with some of the financial sureties for her release.

March 1: The Justice Department gives the formal go-ahead for the extradition case to proceed.

March 3: Meng's defence team announces it has filed a notice of civil claim alleging ""serious violations"" of their client's constitutional rights.

March 4: China accuses the two detained Canadians of acting together to steal state secrets. Trudeau dismissed the allegation made in Chinese state media, saying: ""It is unfortunate that China continues to move forward on these arbitrary detentions.""

March 6: A lawyer for Meng tells a judge the United States bid for extradition raises serious concerns about the political motivations behind the case.

March 14: Huawei pleads not guilty in a New York court to charges accusing it of plotting to violate Iran trade sanctions. Lawyers enter the plea in federal court in Brooklyn, two weeks after Huawei pleaded not guilty to separate federal charges filed in Seattle accusing the company of stealing technology from T-Mobile.

March 22: A judge orders the RCMP to provide copies of the content on seven electronic devices owned by Meng after they were seized when she was arrested. Justice Heather Holmes of the British Columbia Supreme Court says the RCMP must make copies of data on an iPhone, an iPad, a Macbook Air, a Huawei phone, two SIM cards and a flash drive.

March 29: The federal government says it is considering subsidizing farmers hit by China's $2-billion ban on Canadian canola imports.

April 29: Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe says Ottawa needs to treat Chinese imports with the same scrutiny China is showing Canada's canola shipments.

May 1: The federal government changes a payment program for canola farmers to help those affected by China's decision to ban the Canadian product.

May 2: China suspends the export permits of two Canadian pork exporters, including Quebec-based Olymel LP, amid growing tensions between the two countries.

May 8: Meng's defence team tells a judge it plans to argue that she shouldn't be extradited to the United States because she hasn't committed fraud under Canadian laws and her arrest was unlawful.

May 9: Canadian diplomats are joined in a Chinese courtroom by American, British, French and German colleagues to watch an appeal in Schellenberg's case.

May 16: China says it has formally arrested Kovrig and Spavor, bringing them closer to trial on vaguely defined state security charges. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman says they have been arrested for allegedly stealing state secrets. Goodale says the federal government is ""deeply concerned"" about China's decision, adding that no evidence has been produced to indicate any validity to allegations made against them.

May 23: China's ambassador to Canada says the bilateral relationship is at ""rock bottom"" compared to any time since diplomatic ties were first established decades ago. In prepared text for a speech, Lu Shaye says he's saddened Canada-China relations are at what he called a ""freezing point.""

June 5: Lawyers for the RCMP and Canada Border Services Agency deny allegations that their officers searched Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou's phones and electronic devices after a border official wrote down her passwords. A joint response filed in court to Meng's civil lawsuit says a border officer asked Meng for her phone numbers and passwords in case he was required to search the devices for customs or immigration purposes. Meng's civil lawsuit filed in B.C. Supreme Court alleges ""serious violations"" of her constitutional rights and accuses officers of detaining and questioning her for three hours before notifying her of her arrest.

June 13: Freeland rejects the purported view of former prime minister Jean Chretien that the extradition request be cancelled to improve relations with China and win the release of Kovrig and Spavor. Freeland said while she respects Chretien, Canada is either a rule of law country or it is not. Chretien's comments were reported in the Globe and Mail citing anonymous sources.

June 24: Defence lawyers for Meng ask Ottawa to stop the extradition process against their client, saying the request made by the United States was for political purposes, not legitimate law enforcement reasons.

Aug. 20: Court documents released ahead of Meng's extradition hearing suggest a Canadian border official questioned her about her business before the RCMP arrested her. The nearly 1,100 pages of material released by the court were collected by Meng's defence team.

Aug. 21: Meng's lawyers allege Canadian officials acted as ""agents"" of American law enforcement while she was detained at Vancouver's airport for three hours ahead of her arrest. In court documents, they point to handwritten notes by Canadian officers indicating Meng's electronics were collected in anticipation of a request from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States.

Sept. 4. Business consultant Dominic Barton is named as Canada's new ambassador to China.

Sept. 23: The Crown says Canadian officials followed the law when they detained Meng and the defence has no proof to substantiate its ""conspiracy theory"" that she was illegally arrested. The Attorney General of Canada says in court documents that there's no evidence to suggest that the RCMP or the FBI asked border agents to elicit information from Meng during the detainment.

Sept. 24: A lawyer for Meng says there was nothing ""routine"" about the way she was questioned by border officials before she was read her rights and informed of her arrest as Meng's defence team asks the B.C. Supreme Court to compel the release of further documents to support its arguments ahead of her extradition hearing in January.

Oct. 1: A Crown prosecutor tells a judge Canadian border guards mistakenly gave the RCMP passcodes to electronic devices belonging to Meng when she was questioned at the Vancouver airport. The Crown says when the border agency realized it had made a mistake, it told the RCMP the codes could not be used or shared because they'd been obtained during a border examination.

Oct. 29: The federal government says Canada's new ambassador to China has met with Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

Oct. 31: In documents, Meng's lawyers maintain there is an ""air of reality"" to an allegation the RCMP illegally shared details of her electronic devices with the FBI, despite new affidavits from the Mounties denying the claim.

Nov. 5. A Chinese ban on the import of Canadian pork and beef products estimated to have cost farmers almost $100 million is lifted.

Nov. 24: Canada's new foreign affairs minister spends an hour in talks with his Chinese counterpart over the fate of Kovrig and Spavor. Francois-Philippe Champagne spoke with China's Wang Yi a day earlier at a G20 meeting of foreign ministers in Japan.

Nov. 28: Lawyers for Meng say the United States is ""dressing up"" its complaint that she violated sanctions as a case of fraud as they ask the B.C. Supreme Court to decline her extradition. In court documents released, Meng's legal team says the alleged misrepresentation does not amount to fraud and the transactions processed by HSBC were not illegal in Canada.

Dec. 2: Meng says she has experienced feelings of helplessness, torment and struggle since being arrested, but no longer fears the unknown. In a post on the Chinese telecom company's website, Meng says she has passed the time on bail in one of her homes in Vancouver reading books, chatting with colleagues and painting.

Dec. 10: Justice Minister David Lametti says he is troubled that Kovrig and Spavor have been denied access to lawyers as they face trials where convictions are virtually assured. Meanwhile, Meng wins an application in the B.C. Supreme Court for more documents to be disclosed as she alleges there was an abuse of process during her arrest.

2020

Jan. 23: A lawyer for Meng argues the extradition case against her is a test of whether courts will reject foreign charges that run contrary to Canadian values as a hearing wrapped up in the B.C. Supreme Court. The hearing focused on the legal test of double criminality. Crown counsel Robert Frater says the judge does not necessarily need to consider American sanctions law for the allegations to amount to fraud in Canada.

March 13: Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese Embassy in Canada says Kovrig has been allowed to have a telephone conversation with his father, who is very ill. The embassy says in a statement that they allowed the call for humanitarian reasons, and it also says Kovrig and fellow detainee Michael Spavor are being given better food to strengthen their immunity against the novel coronavirus.

May 27: Holmes rules against Meng on the double-criminality argument. The B.C. Supreme Court judge says the allegations against Meng could constitute a crime in Canada.

June 15: Lawyers for Meng accuse authorities in the United States of misleading the B.C. Supreme Court judge presiding over the extradition case. Meng's defence team says it is seeking a stay in the proceedings arguing that U.S. case records are ""grossly inaccurate and based on deliberate and/or reckless misstatements of fact and material omissions, thereby constituting a serious abuse of the extradition process.""

June 19: China charges Kovrig and Spavor with spying. Kovrig was charged in Beijing on suspicion of spying for state secrets and intelligence. Spavor was charged in Dandong city near the North Korean border on suspicion of spying for a foreign entity and illegally providing state secrets.

Aug. 25: Meng loses her battle to have the contents of six confidential documents released to her legal team after arguing in Federal Court that the redacted documents would support the position that their client suffered an abuse of process during her arrest. Justice Catherine Kane says the information contained in the documents is not relevant to the allegations of abuse described by Meng's legal team.

She said she's sick of letting people get away with bullying, and vowed to defend fellow queen and contestant Rita Baga against the vitriol she's also getting online.

Verley later tweeted that she's now fine and ""in a really good head space.""

The acclaimed author said he enjoys searching the web for must-see sites of a far-off city, checking out the availability of flights and hotels, and calculating the cost of his travel itinerary.

But when it comes time to book, King would rather see the world from the comfort of his home in Guelph, Ont.

""I can have a little espresso at my desk, and look all this stuff up, and it often feels like I've travelled there,"" King, 77, said in a recent phone interview.

""If I don't travel again, I don't know that I'll miss it.""

This weariness of wanderlust animates King's new novel, ""Indians on Vacation,"" which hit shelves Tuesday.

The story follows Canadian couple Mimi and Bird on a peripatetic mission across Europe to recover a family medicine bundle that a long-lost relative absconded with a century earlier.

As they drift from one destination to the next, the two must navigate their conflicting tourist temperaments.

Mimi, with her trusty guidebook in hand, believes that travel is ""broadening."" Meanwhile, Bird, like the book's author, is skeptical that there's much to be gained by straying too far from home.

""When we travel, a lot of times, the thing we come away with is we've been entertained,"" said King.

""I don't know that we feel any differently towards the people that we see on our travels. We find them interesting, sometimes even exotic. And for a moment, perhaps we have a kind of broadening. But I think by the time people get home, that's tightened up again.""

If anything, travel can show that prejudice knows no borders, said King, who was born in the U.S. and is of Greek and Cherokee descent.

From mountain towns to major cities, King said he's often confronted by racist stereotypes of Indigenous Peoples while abroad, including a photographer in France who asked him to pose with a pool stick as if it were a spear.

""What they want is that inauthentic historical image that Hollywood has made up over the years,"" said King.

""It's always the one kind of Indian they've got because the others don't play well visually. Me in a T-shirt and a pair of walking shorts — God forbid anybody see me in walking shorts — that just doesn't do it.""

In writing ""Indians on Vacation,"" King said he wanted to ""play against type"" by depicting Indigenous characters who are well-off enough to travel the world, while still engaging with the historic inequities that have made such portrayals a rarity in popular culture.

As the COVID-19 pandemic has closed down borders, King won't have to endure airplane food, forced photo-ops or guided walking tours any time soon.

The lengthy report from the Special Investigations Unit notes that Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked ""important conversations"" about the ways in which police interact with Black and Indigenous people, but says there was no evidence of police wrongdoing or ""overt"" racism in the incident itself.

article continues below

Director Joseph Martino said race may have been a factor in the events leading up to the death of the 29-year-old, who was both Indigenous and Black, but that examining systemic issues in policing is not his role.

""The task before me was a narrow one — namely, to determine whether there were reasonable grounds, on the evidence collected by the SIU, to believe that any one or more of the officers who responded to Ms. Korchinski-Paquet's apartment committed a criminal offence in connection with her death,"" he wrote.

The Special Investigations Unit said six officers were in the 29-year-old woman's Toronto home when she fell from the balcony in May, while her mother and brother were nearby.

The agency's report says Korchinski-Paquet's mother called police to the home because the two siblings were fighting — ""bottles and punches had been thrown"" — and she wanted both of them removed from the apartment.

It says Korchinski-Paquet and her brother also called 911 during the argument, which began as a dispute over the volume of the TV.

When the 911 operator asked about any mental health issues, the report says, the family indicated that Korchinski-Paquet had epilepsy and had had seizures earlier in the day.

It says that after police arrived, two officers blocked Korchinski-Paquet from getting to her mother and brother before allowing her back into the apartment so she could use the bathroom.

She then went out onto the 24th-floor balcony and prevented officers from joining her by holding her body against the door.

""Very quickly, Ms. Korchinski-Paquet scaled the balcony railing and the (subject officer) lost sight of her,"" the report reads.

She then tried to scale the balcony and cross onto the adjoining one, which is when she lost her balance and fell to her death, the report reads.

The agency said no officers were on the balcony with Korchinski-Paquet at the time, and there's no evidence the officers committed a crime.

Martino said that the officers seemed to be confused about whether epilepsy was a mental health condition and if they should or could detain Korchinski-Paquet under the Mental Health Act.

""The limited layperson's research I have conducted of the matter suggests that epilepsy is a neurological disorder with manifestations that can be mental as well as physical,"" Martino wrote. ""Be that as it may, I cannot fault the officers for failing to take Ms. Korchinski-Paquet into custody prior to her scaling the balcony railing. She had not given them any indication that she wished to harm herself and was professing to be the victim of an assault at the hands of her brother.""

He also said the officers tried to de-escalate the situation between Korchinski-Paquet's family.

The decision comes after the arm's-length agency interviewed all six officers, along with 15 civilian witnesses.

The agency said investigators also received a written statement from Korchinski-Paquet's father, with whom she had been speaking on the phone moments before her death.

Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked protests in the city and calls to change the way police deal with people experiencing mental health crises.

Martino noted that Korchinski-Paquet died just days after George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, was killed when an officer pressed a knee against his neck for nearly nine minutes, at a time when there was increased scrutiny over the relationship between police and racialized people.

In Toronto, thousands of protesters took to the streets on May 30, three days after the incident in Korchinski-Paquet's apartment. Several smaller marches followed it over the next several weeks.

Two city counsellors then brought forward a motion to defund Toronto police, but it was struck down in favour of introducing body-worn cameras to the force.

The Toronto Police Services Board, the body that oversees the force, then launched a series of town halls to discuss systemic racism in policing, though many protesters said such information-gathering had been done before to little effect.

Toronto police and Korchinski-Paquet’s family were expected to comment on the SIU report at separate news conferences later Wednesday.

Other speakers tonight include senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, who is leaving the White House at the end of the month, and Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn.

A devout Catholic, Pence and wife Karen are expected to carry the evangelical banner into Day 3 of the convention, touting Trump as the best choice for Americans who consider themselves social conservatives.

Democrats seized on the opportunity, deploying the openly gay Pete Buttigieg, one of Joe Biden's former presidential rivals, in a fundraising missive denouncing Pence's ""divisive, anti-LGBTQ politics"" and ""archaic worldview.""

As head of the White House coronavirus force, Pence is also likely to address an issue that has so far received relatively scant attention from convention speakers: the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Tuesday, economic adviser Larry Kudlow spoke of the crisis in the past tense, even though the pandemic continues to rage across the U.S., while only first lady Melania Trump expressed any empathy for the more than 178,000 Americans killed by the virus to date.

""My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one, and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering,"" she said. ""I know many people are anxious, and some feel helpless. I want you to know you are not alone.""

Kudlow, meanwhile, framed the novel coronavirus as ancient history in the U.S.

""It was awful — health and economic impacts were tragic, hardship and heartbreak were everywhere,"" Kudlow said. ""But presidential leadership came swiftly and effectively, with an extraordinary rescue for health and safety to successfully fight the COVID virus.""

Of the racial unrest roiling the country — fuelled this week by another police shooting of an unarmed Black man, this time in Wisconsin — Melania Trump urged protesters to channel their furious energy into positive change, not wanton destruction. She also resisted the urge to ""divide the country further"" by beating up on Democrats.

But she raised eyebrows by framing her husband, notorious for playing fast and loose with the truth, as an honest and authentic human being.

""Total honesty is what we as citizens deserve from our president,"" she said. ""Whether you like it or not, you always know what he's thinking.""

Trump has been putting the power of the presidency under a brazen partisan spotlight, and did so again Tuesday, pardoning a convicted bank robber who now helps prisoners reintegrate into society and presiding over a naturalization ceremony for five new American citizens. His wife's speech was delivered from the White House Rose Garden.

And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's pre-taped speech from a Jerusalem rooftop, coming in the middle of a diplomatic mission, did not escape the attention of some members of Congress. Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is accusing Pompeo of violating federal law by mixing government business with partisan interests.

During those 30 years one thing has never changed for Bos. She has always dreamed of one day owning lakefront — specifically land on the west side of the lake that looks directly across the waters to Mt. Baldy. Her ideal property is located in front of her main residence, which is tucked away in the woods behind a country road lined with large cedars. Bos’ home, while close to the lake, doesn’t have lake access or an unobstructed waterfront view, while this preferred property has both.

article continues below

Besides its great outlook the property has two small cabins on it, which were built during the early days of Shawnigan Lake’s cottage history. They were owned by a Victoria lawyer, who bought them in 1957 and only used them in summer.

“I used to walk down in the winter months to this spot and wish I could buy this place,” says Bos, standing near a picnic table with a gorgeous view of the lake and an arbutus tree near the water’s edge.

Getting to realize her dream of owning her “piece of paradise” didn’t come easy for Bos, who had to do it on her own as a single woman. She was separated in January, 2017 and finances were tight.

But she was determined. When Bos heard the owners planned to sell the property she was able to secure a private mortgage in order to make the deal happen quickly before it hit the MLS.

While many others would have torn down the humble cabins to build something modern that didn’t happen with Bos. “Necessity is the mother of invention I couldn’t afford to tear them down and rebuild so the only option was to fix them up. And then it became a story of ignorance is bliss and hindsight is 20/20. I’m not sure that I would do it again but then again, seeing the result, I can’t imagine not,” she says.

Bos took possession of her beloved lakefront property, becoming its third owner, in November, 2019. Although she finally had her lakefront a new desire was born. Bos wanted to create a unique vacation rental, which helps the property pay for itself.

As Shawnigan Lake continues to gain popularity, with many of the old-time cottages torn down and replaced by new builds, there are few opportunities for vacationers to experience life at the lake in the “good old days”- albeit with modern-day amenities, like wifi and air conditioning.

After acquiring the property Bos immediately began fixing up the cabins in order to welcome her first guests this summer on July 4th. Help came from many friends who Bos calls her “Shawnigan Angels.”

“Because of COVID no one could get away on vacation. I think for some I was entertainment value. They would come around to see what I was up to and offer help. Some would bring me food to keep me going, offer to paint furniture, fix items, bring me give gifts,” she says.

One friend, who wanted to be a professional water skier, gave Bos her wooden slalom water ski, dating back to 1950. It’s now on display in the larger cabin.

Since Bos’ background is in marketing, she put her skills to good use and created a vision for the cabins starting with the name, “Vintage Cabins, where life is, still.”

“Vintage Cabins also indicates that it is a place with history, not a 5-star accommodation but a place where you take your shoes off, a ‘muck-about’ space where you come in off the lake dripping wet and run into the cabin to grab a snack with the screen door banging behind you. The screen door was rebuilt and kept just for this reason,” she says.

Bos also drew on the history of the first home owners, calling the larger cabin, at 750 sq. ft., The Tailor’s Cabin since it was built by tailor William Cuzner in 1912. Her logo is a needle and thread in honor of the tailor.

According to his granddaughter, Cuzner came to Shawnigan Lake, by train, then rowed across the lake to this spot to build a home so his two sons could study at Shawnigan Lake School. He logged some of the trees on the property, to build the cabin then ran his business out of a small nook in one of the corners.

That nook was repurposed by Bos as a small games space, with a card table, vintage children’s book and toys, and in another nod to Cuzner, an old sewing box and wooden measuring stick. These are just a few of the curated vintage items in the cabin, adding to the cabin’s relaxed ambience.

The story goes Cuzner also wanted his two sons to learn construction so he taught them how to build the smaller of the two cabins in 1945. That cabin, called The Birdhouse, is appropriately decorated with vintage birdhouses and carved wooden birds. On its outdoor porch is a sheltered office with a display cabinet made from old water skis.

The decor of both cabins shows Bos’ keen eye and smart design choices.

“It’s easy to junk up a space so I’m trying hard not to have too much stuff,” she says.

Many of the pieces she has brought in are not only beautiful in their form but serve a function. For instance, Bos took an old suitcase and repurposed it as a side table, used a vintage, wooden shoe form as a doorstop and turned an old hat mould into a unique mirror.

But before she could have fun decorating the hard work needed to happen to get the cabins in good working order, since they were in rough shape after years of deferred maintenance.

“I had to gut the kitchen [of the Tailor’s Cabin]. When the ceiling was ripped out it snowed insulation and rat fees. The rafters were chewed from carpenter ants so it had to be all cleared out. I let it air out literally for a couple of months,” she says.

The kitchen now is full of country charm with bead board, vintage red cabinets and a gleaming white sink, from a kindergarten classroom and cleaned up. She was also able to reuse the appliances after giving them a good clean.

Another big task was ensuring the cabins were structurally sound. In the case of the Tailor’s Cabin one of its main corner posts rests on an old log stump. The cabin still stands on the stump, but its structural support has been reinforced. A happy result of shoring up the house was one of the original windows that didn’t open for decades now functions properly.

That cabin still has the original bottle glass, dating back to the early 1900s, so the lakeside windows here provide a charming “looking glass” view of the lake and Mt. Baldy beyond.

Other necessary property work that had to be done included a new septic field, new driveway, upgrading the plumbing and electrical and doing the landscaping, which meant removing decades of Salal, and rotten trees found on the property.

Then there was the business of building new decks to take advantage of the view, and bringing in two docks -one private for guests and the other Bos shares with them so she can continue to get out on the lake and enjoy water skiing.

“This has been my passion project. I just feel so blessed now that it’s done,” she says.

Or is it? Bos is considering converting an old shed on the property into either a sleeping cabana or a place of stillness.

Children have very specific tastes and are happiest when they can submerge themselves in their favourite pastimes, be it superheroes, sports heroes, music icons or fashion trends.

As they grow, it’s natural that their ideas about what’s totally important to them changes as surely as day becomes night. A little bedroom decorating is called for to keep up with the times.

A friend of mine asked for my help with the task of revising her 14-year-old daughter Anna’s room. Her daughter was very ‘hands-on’ and wanted to make it all happen. Colour came first and I wasn’t surprised to hear that she was all about purple.

There are many glorious shades of purple, from the softest lilac to mauve, so rather than have a solid colour that would be too dominant, we chose to apply a blend of shades to the walls. The base coat is pale pink. Yipes, she said, but that was just for starters. I chose lavender and lilac pearlescent latex paint and we washed them randomly over the pink base coat with rollers and while still wet, the surface was rubbed gently with a soft cloth to remove any brush strokes and blend the shades. She was impressed as she saw the shimmer of her chosen colour emerge.

Next, it was time to add some custom features to her room. Purple sheers were hung at the window and Anna and her friends made flower strings to hang in front. Anna is a crafter so off we went to the craft store and found silk string, drinking straws for spacers and small flowers and leaves. String is threaded through a straw, then a decorative flower is attached with thin wire, then another straw This opens up lots of options for making strings using beads, shells, ribbons and bows, or miniatures. The decorated strings measured the length of the sheers and were hung from cup hooks attached to a white dowel the width of the window.

Moving around the room, Anna looked at her old bed lamp with some disgust. That was easy to remedy with a new purple shade and some craft shop flowers to glue on.

Once you embark on a theme room, the ideas start to flow. The walls can be adorned with custom frames, again decorated with crafty items. And clothing doesn’t always have to be delegated to a closet. If you have a budding fashionista, why not utilize a portable coat rack? Display outfits, hats and belts in the open with a shoe rack underneath for dress-up sandals as well as the ubiquitous running shoes.

Open shelving allows for displays of everything from necessities to trivia. All fun, and not so difficult to change up when the time has come for the next stage.

Share in the progress as your child discovers how to surround themselves with what makes them happy. You might learn something; I know I have.

I grab the last chair in a tiny place, next to two bearded men hunched over their mandolins, lost in their music. A bald singer croons, looking like an old turtle without a shell. There’s not a complete set of teeth in the house. A spry grandma does a little jive, balancing a wine bottle on her head.

The kitchen staff peer from a steaming hole in the wall, backlit by their flaming grill. The waiter sets a plate of fish and a pitcher of cheap cask wine on my table and — like a Portuguese Ed Sullivan — proudly introduces the next singer, a woman who has been singing here for more than 50 years.

She’s the star: blood-red lipstick, big hair, a mourning shawl over her black dress. Towering above me, flanked by those mandolins, she’s a fusion of moods — old and young, both sad and sexy. Her revealing neckline promises there’s life after death. I can smell her breath as she drowns out the sizzle of sardines with her plush voice.

The man next to me whispers in my ear a rough English translation of the words she sings.

It’s a quintessential fado theme of lost sailors and sad widows: “O waves of the salty sea, where do you get your salt? From the tears shed by the women in black on the sad shores of Portugal.” Suddenly it’s surround-sound as the diners burst into song, joining the chorus.

Fado is the folk music of Lisbon’s rustic neighbourhoods: so accessible to anyone willing to be out late and stroll the back streets. Since the mid-1800s, it’s been the Lisbon blues — mournfully beautiful and haunting ballads about long-gone sailors, broken hearts, and bittersweet romance. Fado means “fate” — how fate deals with Portugal’s adventurers … and the families they leave behind. The lyrics reflect the pining for a loved one across the water, hopes for a future reunion, remembrances of a rosy past or dreams of a better future. It’s the yearning for what might have been if fate had not intervened. While generally sad, fado can be jaunty … in a nostalgic way.

The songs are often in a minor key. The singer (fadista) is accompanied by stringed instruments, including a 12-string guitarra portuguesa with a round body like a mandolin (or, as the man whispering in my ear said, “like a woman”).

Fado singers typically crescendo into the first word of the verse, like a moan emerging from deep inside. Though the songs are often sorrowful, the singers rarely overact — they plant themselves firmly and sing stoically in the face of fate.

You can visit Lisbon’s fado museum, located at the foot of the characteristic Alfama district.

It’s well worth the time for its re-created bar scenes, its glamorous photo gallery of fado’s biggest stars, and a chance to learn about the uniquely Portuguese instruments that go with the genre. The museum is especially memorable for its user-friendly audio clips that demonstrate the evolution of the art form and its many variations, and for a chance to hear the iconic crooners of fado’s glory days. But don’t let that be the extent of your fado experience. You must stay up past your bedtime and take in that scene while you’re in Lisbon.

While fado has become one of Lisbon’s favourite late-night tourist traps, I can still find funky bars — without the high prices and big-bus tour groups — that feel very local.

Two districts, the Alfama and the Bairro Alto, have small, informal fado restaurants for late dinners or even later evenings of drinks and music.

Handwritten “fado tonight” (fado esta noite) signs in Portuguese are good news, but even a restaurant filled with tourists can serve up fine fado with its sardines.

After thanking the man who’d translated the songs for me, I leave the bar late that night feeling oddly uplifted. An evening seasoned with the tears of black-clad widows reminds me that life, even salty with sadness, is worth embracing.

Rick Steves (ricksteves.com) writes European travel guidebooks and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio.","As we’ve had to postpone our travels because of the pandemic, I believe a weekly dose of travel dreaming can be good medicine. Here’s a reminder of the fun that awaits us in Europe at the other end of this crisis.

While food might be an art form in Italy, it’s more like a religion in Sicily. Even if you know Italian food well, Sicilian cuisine will surprise you with its complexity — a legacy of successive waves of settlers and invaders who influenced the cuisine.

The first time you find yourself choosing between fish couscous and spaghetti Bolognese on the same menu, you know you’re at a crossroads of cultures. Thanks to centuries of North African and Middle Eastern influences, Sicilian cuisine includes distinctive ingredients such as couscous, almonds, ginger, apricots, cinnamon, and lots of citrus. Arabs who came here popularized fried foods, which is why so many Sicilian street food classics — and even some pastas — are deep-fried. Sicilian cooking also comes with Greek and Spanish touches.

The Sicilian diet relies on Italian staples such as pastas, olives, and tomatoes, but with a local twist. The island’s warm temperatures and fertile volcanic soil mean that everything from citrus to nuts are available home-grown. Produce is fresh, cheap, and plentiful — and sold at markets that more closely resemble an Arab souk than a European marketplace. Seafood is abundant.

One of the most memorable ways to eat in Sicily is also one of the cheapest: street food, especially in Sicily’s capital, Palermo. Ballarò Market, dating to the 10th century, is the most authentic. Vendors here still maintain the Arab tradition of calling out to passersby in a singsong way, like auctioneers. Food carts are scattered among the stalls, selling panelle (chickpea fritters), sfincione (fluffy pizza with anchovies), potato croquettes and lots of other eats.

The most popular items are the arancine, deep-fried rice balls with meat sauce inside, which are flavoured with vivid yellow saffron and contain no tomatoes. (Sicily’s second city, Catania, and mainland Italy call this dish arancino and add tomato to the filling — two things a Palermo native wouldn’t be caught dead doing.)

For a small island, Sicily has an remarkable range of local specialties. Trapani, on the west coast, is geographically and culturally the island’s closest point to Africa — and the best place to try couscous al pesce, couscous served with a side of fish broth that you ladle on to taste. Fancier variations are topped with shellfish and other seafood.

In Modica, in the southeast, try the grainy, bittersweet cioccolato di Modica.

Sicily was under Spanish rule just as explorers were returning from the New World with exotic new foods, including cocoa beans. Modica mastered this new ingredient, crushing it on basalt plates and adding local sugar, creating an early version of chocolate bars.

In Catania, on Sicily’s eastern shore at the base of Mount Etna, quench your thirst with a seltz e limone (seltz, for short) — fresh-squeezed lemon juice with seltzer water. They’ll ask you “sale?” to see if you want salt added. (It might sound strange, but a little salt makes this brew exceptionally thirst-quenching.)

Sicily also has its own pasta dishes. Anelletti al forno is ring-shaped pasta, baked with tomatoes, meat, eggplant and cheese. Busiate alla Trapanese is a twisty noodle topped with red pesto made from almonds, tomatoes, garlic and basil.

Pasta alla Norma, named for an opera by Catania-born composer Vincenzo Bellini, is made with fried eggplant, tomato sauce, basil and salted ricotta cheese on top. A top-end choice for those who enjoy a taste of the sea is spaghetti ai ricci, spaghetti topped with sea urchin.

Wine has been produced on the shores of Sicily since the time of the Greeks.

The island, whose various grape-growing areas have their own distinctive characteristics, is one of Italy’s biggest wine producers.

Some of the grapes grown here, such as the red nerello grape, can be found only in Sicily. Western Sicily is best known for its Marsala wine, and the Mount Etna area has become a magnet for boutique wine producers for its the rich volcanic soil and old vines.

Wineries cluster around the north slope, like a Sicilian Napa Valley.

Sicilian desserts are also distinctive and delicious, most made with a combination of sugar, almonds, citrus and ricotta. The island’s most famous and best sweets are cannoli.

A crispy fried pastry tube is filled with sweetened ricotta, then dusted with powdered sugar.

The mark of a high-quality cannolo is one that’s filled right when you order it — otherwise, the shell gets soggy and loses its crunch.

After tasting cannoli at a Sicilian pastry shop, I know why they say: “Holy cannoli.”

One thing is certain about Sicily: For locals, the food can be a religious experience.

Asking a simple question can yield a very unexpected answer.

article continues below

Where would you park in a multi-level open air parking garage? This is the question I directed to a student driver. He said he would drive up a number of levels until he reached an upper level with very few vehicles. He would then take a space where there were no vehicles immediately left or right. His plan was more about not getting the doors chipped, and less about visibility when leaving a parking space. Out of the mouths of babes?

He then said the upper most parking level is one he would never take, given his dad’s bad experience with seagull excrement bombardment.

Social distancing has been adopted behind the wheel in more and more situations. Be mindful of your bubble. Many drivers now park away from the main doors of the mall, not because of a vehicle safety situation, but rather a health initiative. It is so much easier to back into a peripheral parking space than be on the lookout for the possibility of multi-directional vehicle contact. Drive-through spaces are always the best way of avoiding reverse gear.

There are many more single-occupant vehicles on the road since COVID-19. Drivers without passengers are the vast majority throughout the weekdays, with there being a slight increase in multi-person occupancy on the weekends. Multi-person occupied vehicles are more likely to be those in which the riders are wearing masks recommended by health authorities. This type of count was conducted over the last month and is far from empirical data, but more of a simple observation.

Car dealerships are sensitive to the singleton test driver, as opposed to the sales staff accompanying the prospective buyer. Wiping down the vehicle before and after such a drive is now mandatory for all such dealerships and associated businesses.

Space is no longer thought of as the final frontier, Star Trek style, but more as a degree of separation mandated by health authorities. This whole idea of allowing more space between people outside of one’s COVID-19 bubble has compatibility with the type of space cushion driving practised by many professionally trained drivers.

A driver will never hit a space, injure or kill a space. Space cushion driving is a lot like social distancing when walking. Spaces are used as escapes when drivers are threatened with an imminent but avoidable crash situation.

Social distancing can be a prelude to any driver’s lane choice. It can also be a factor in the route selection for those travelling to work or on related household duties. It is better to choose a path of travel which allows for wide shoulders and multi-lane escape potential, than narrow pathways where the only crash avoidance technique is to brake and hope.

The social distancing bubble is like the driving diamond. Picture one’s vehicle with an imaginary diamond shape around it. The driver would have a better chance of avoiding a crash by steering right or left when this predetermined and intended space is provided.

Lane choice and speed maintenance are important in maintaining such spaces.

The front and back space cushion of the imaginary diamond completes the similarity to the social distancing bubble.

Maintaining proper following distance will help avoid a rear-end crash, the most common of all crashes. The judicious use of the four-way flashers, to discourage tailgating, completes the space cushion driving practice.

This type of driving will give better protection to both pedestrians and cyclists. Always plan to have one side open and ready for escape when travelling in a lateral fashion with those biking and walking.

It proved to be an excellent prediction.

Sales jumped to almost 38,000, more than the previous two years combined. McNamara had set the Thunderbird on a new size and class trajectory that would peak in the 1970s. It would also set his own career on a trajectory to the presidency of the Ford Motor Co. in 1960.

The 1958 Thunderbird grew from its original length of 4,453 mm (175.3 in.) in 1955 to 5,217 (205.4) where it stabilized until 1966. It then grew to 5,331 mm (209.9 in.) for 1967.

The arrival of the 1972 sixth generation Thunderbird was the launch of its greatest period of growth, and its large step to a 5,436 mm (214 in.) length seemed to be just what the market wanted, boosting sales from 57,000 ’71s to 87,000 ’72s. This two-door hardtop (the only offering) was so large it shared its body-on-frame architecture with the Lincoln Continental Mark IV.

Underneath was typical American hardware with independent A-arm-and-coil-spring front suspension and solid axle on coil springs at the rear. Brakes were power assisted disc front and drum rear. The only transmission was a three-speed automatic.

Power came from the standard 7.0 litre (429 cu in.) overhead valve V-8 or optional 7.5 (460) V-8, both down significantly in power ratings from the ’71s. The 7.0 litre was listed at only 212 horsepower compared with 360 the year before.

There were a couple of reasons for the apparent loss of power. First was the change in the horsepower rating method from SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) “gross” rating to more realistic SAE “net,” i.e. as installed in the car.

The other reason was reducing compression ratios to accommodate the unleaded gasoline required by exhaust-cleansing catalytic converters.

There were none of the original sporting pretensions in the ’72 ‘Bird: it was a large luxury car pure and simple with a 3,058 mm (120.4 in.) wheelbase and nearly 2,032 mm (80 in.) width. It had the classic long hood/short deck profile and taillamps from wall to wall. Weight was a hefty 1,996 kg (4,400 lb).

For those who purchased cars based on mass and size it was irresistible.

Consumers loved the big ‘Bird and the millionth Thunderbird that came off the line was a 1972 model.

There were no big changes for 1973, except for an eggcrate grille rather than horizontal bars, and opera windows that slightly improved visibility. A further compression decrease reduced power to 201 for the 7.0 litre (426 cu in.) but buyers didn’t seem to care as long as they got their coddling luxury.

Unfortunately for Ford and other American auto manufacturers, disaster was on the horizon. The first “oil crisis” of the 1970s, caused by an Organization of Petroleum Producing Countries oil embargo would arrive late in 1973.

This tripled the price of oil, increased the price of gasoline and even more alarmingly, threatened its supply.

It reduced demand for large V-8-powered cars with the result that Thunderbird’s sales of ’74 models, now with the big 7.0 litre (460 cu in.) V-8 fell to 57,000.

Model lead times being what they are, Ford couldn’t turn the T-Bird around on a dime and 1975 and 1976 models were little changed. A “quick defrost” option promised faster window defrosting via a thin gold film embedded in the glass, but it proved to be a power hog and was discontinued in 1976.

The ’75s got optional four-wheel disc brakes, and thanks to government mandated five mph (8 km/h) bumpers it reached a length of 5,740 mm (226 in.), the longest Ford ever.

Times were turning against cars like the huge Thunderbird and 1975 sales fell to 42,000. But consumers’ memories are short and when the oil crisis ended, sales rebounded to 53,000 for 1976.

In spite of improved ’76 sales, it was clear the future lay in smaller cars.

With fuel economy legislation on the horizon, the Thunderbird would start shrinking with its 1977 seventh generation. It would get a six-cylinder engine, and even a four in the ’80s, much to the chagrin of many Thunderbird fans.

The 1972-1976 Thunderbird was caught in the transition to smaller, more sensible and economical cars.

It was the epitome of the big, garish models that made Motor City rich, dominant and some said even arrogant during the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s.

Those big ’Birds now stand as monuments to a more profligate era when gasoline was still cheap and bigger was better.

In an energy- and environmentally challenged world, it’s unlikely we will see their ilk again.

Breton said the additional provincial rebate makes buying electric cars more attractive in Quebec and B.C.
Transport Minister Marc Garneau was instructed in his mandate letter to do more to make the electric car sales quotas.

Transport Canada data obtained by The Canadian Press this week shows 75 per cent of the $300-million program has already been spoken for, just 15 months into its three-year mandate.

article continues below

The rebate, which provides up to $5,000 back on the purchase or lease of a new battery vehicle, or a battery-gasoline hybrid one, began May 1, 2019, and was supposed to run until April 30, 2022.

But as of July 31, more than $225 million had been paid out to 53,510 drivers.

""It's no surprise to me,"" said Daniel Breton, president of Electric Mobility Canada, a non-profit agency pushing for the electrification of transportation.

Electric car sales, as a share of overall vehicle purchases, have steadily grown from two per cent of all sales in 2018 to three per cent last year, and to almost four per cent in the first three months of 2020.

But the rate of uptake is heavily concentrated in just three provinces. Quebec and British Columbia, which have sales quotas for electric cars and provincial rebates on top of the federal one, together account for 86 per cent of all the rebates.

Ontario, which had a provincial rebate until 2019, accounted for another 12 per cent, with the remaining two per cent divided among the other seven provinces and the territories.

Breton said the additional provincial rebate makes buying electric cars more attractive in Quebec and B.C. but car makers are also shipping more electric cars there because their dealers have quotas for sales. Availability of electric models is limited, and many drivers have to wait weeks or months for one.

Electric Mobility Canada wants Ottawa to expand the program to include used cars and to increase the maximum purchase price of the cars that qualify for a rebate. SUVs and pickup trucks, which are more expensive, are set to come onto the market. In 2019, almost three in every four passenger vehicles sold were SUVs and pickups.

Cara Clairman, CEO of the non-profit advocacy group Plug'n Drive, says she hopes Ottawa will provide more money for rebates when the current allotment runs out because they are making a difference.

""I think we do need a few more years of it,"" she said. ""You have to look at it as a climate-change program.""

Canada has set targets to have 10 per cent of all passenger vehicles sold be electric by 2025, 30 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2040. Breton said that won't happen if the rebate isn't expanded.

Breton is also looking for the rebates to be extended to used electric and hybrid vehicles, which are now more easy to find than new ones in many cases. A 10-per-cent rebate on the purchase of a used electric car was mentioned in the mandate letter for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains last fall but has not yet been announced.

Transport Minister Marc Garneau was instructed in his mandate letter to do more to make the electric car sales quotas. Before the pandemic, he indicated he was looking at what more to do, including extending or expanding the rebate program. Something was expected in the March federal budget, delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Garneau's spokeswoman was noncommittal Thursday when asked if the rebate program would be expanded.

""This specific program continues and consumers are able to make use of the incentive,"" Livia Belcea said in an email. ""Any changes in funding for the program would be reviewed at the appropriate time and as needed.""

""Really easy to talk to.""

People remembered the young man's outgoing personality at his funeral this week. He died in a Calgary hospital last Saturday after collapsing on a run.

His father, a trucker, was able to be by his son's side.

He said a major blood clot had formed around a stent placed in his son's aorta. The stent was necessary after he survived a serious highway accident on his way to work last year.

""It was a miracle, really.""

Ogden said while in hospital before his death, his son told him he was supposed to go for a CT scan in June while still living in Saskatchewan near Yorkton.

It was a routine checkup on the stent, but the appointment was postponed because of restrictions around the COVID-19 pandemic and never rescheduled.

""I didn't think nothing of it at the time, but I mulled it over ... as we watched him decline,"" Ogden said.

""It hit me. He was trying to tell me: 'This shouldn't have happened.'""

The father believes that had his son's scan not been cancelled, doctors might have found the blood clot in time.

Ogden wants all postponed hospital procedures done immediately.

""People's lives are being lost,"" he said. ""These COVID rules are way too far.""

Ogden believes the Saskatchewan Health Authority bears responsibility for his son's death.

""Somebody needs to be held to account.""

The health authority halted hundreds of non-urgent surgeries, procedures and diagnostics in March to brace for the pandemic.

Two months later, when the government felt it had a handle on the spread of the novel coronavirus, it announced the resumption of health services would be staggered.

""Emergency and urgent patients are the priority for services, including diagnostic imaging,"" said Corey Miller, vice-president of provincial programs at the health authority.

""The determination of the priority is based on the evaluation of the referring physician in consultation with the patient.""

Miller said they are reviewing Ogden's case and have reached out to his family.

He said the health authority is working through the backlog of exams that were delayed during the first few months of the pandemic.

More than 1,500 CT appointments which had been booked were postponed, he said.

Ogden questions why something like a CT scan couldn't be performed in Yorkton, where the risk of COVID-19 was low.

As of Friday, health officials reported five active cases in the region, which has only seen 33 infections in total since the pandemic hit Saskatchewan.

Cheryl Camillo, a professor with the University of Regina's Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy, says speaking generally, delaying non-essential services to respond to COVID-19 was the responsible thing to do because the virus was new and spreading quickly.

""The risks are that some people don't get the essential and urgent services because so much of the workforce and the resources of the health system move towards responding to COVID,"" said the health systems researcher.

""It's very human for people to get frustrated because health care is something that is so personal.""

She says another risk of scaling back is that people can lose confidence in a health system some may perceive as having overplanned for the pandemic.

Health officials are in the tough spot of having to prepare for the worst case scenario and what could be a rapid change in case numbers, she says.

During the pandemic Camillo's own grandmother died in a long-term care home in the United States from isolation and depression, she says.

""I suffered an individual loss of my otherwise pretty healthy grandmother, but despite how profoundly sad that makes me, I understand and would defend the care home's decision to lock down.

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""

Loblaw Companies Ltd., which began offering COVID-19 testing for patients at a handful of its Alberta pharmacy locations in June, plans to expand the program to all 234 of its pharmacies in the province by Sept. 1.

The company says it has reached out to all 10 provinces to discuss in-store testing outside Alberta, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford this week acknowledging the possibility.

The swab tests are only for those with no symptoms or any known contact with coronavirus patients and may be useful for teachers returning to school or Canadians who take care of an older family member, said Theresa Firestone, head of health and wellness at Shoppers Drug Mart. Loblaw-owned pharmacy locations include Shoppers stores as well as Independent Foods and No Frills.

""It's very convenient. We're in every community. The other plus is they don't have to line up with people who may have symptoms. We've shared that with Ontario and with other provinces, so at this point we’re looking forward to what they may decide,"" Firestone said.

London Drugs also conducts COVID-19 tests in Alberta. It began offering the service at six locations during the past two weeks and plans to roll it out at nine more by October. Like Shoppers, it bills Alberta Health Services for testing costs.

The service builds on other responses to the pandemic such as online pharmacist consultations and a pilot program where patients consult virtually with doctors in a private room in the store.

London Drugs is among the pharmacy retailers beefing up their role in a health-care system grappling with an aging population.

""With the extended hours of operation, you can basically go in when our stores are open and be able to find a pharmacist to ask a question. So what we’re able to do at that point is basically help triage the system,"" said Chris Chiew, head of pharmacy at the Richmond, B.C.-based retailer.

London Drugs has also hired diabetes educators to test blood sugar levels and assist patients with weight management and diet.

Shoppers has stepped even further into the realm of physicians, opening one of three planned medical clinics with doctors who cater to a roster of patients and walk-in services.

""There are a number of Canadians who don’t have access to a family physician. And we thought there was an opportunity for us to really play a role here in terms of access,"" Firestone said.

Drugstores can also handle the bureaucratic side of health care, freeing up doctors to spend more time with patients, she said.

""Looking for PPE (personal protective equipment), sorting out their waiting rooms so that people are socially distanced, managing virtual care...we’re able to take that burden on for them,"" Firestone said.

In 2018, Shoppers launched its Wellwise store chain to sell assisted-living devices aimed at older Canadians. More recently, it began to offer tips and videos online designed to help ward off depression and anxiety.

Metro Inc. declined to comment on any attempts to provide COVID-19 testing. The bulk of the company's Jean Coutu drugstores are located in Quebec, which unlike some provinces does not allow pharmacists to conduct testing via nose and mouth swabs.

The Canadian Association of Broadcasters issued a report on Wednesday warning of potential closures and widespread job cuts as private TV and radio broadcasters face a cumulative projected revenue shortfall of up to $1.06 billion by the end of 2022.

Most vulnerable are the country's AM radio stations, the report said, as well as other independent private radio and TV operations in smaller markets across the country.

The study, titled ""The Crisis in Canadian Media and the Future of Local Broadcasting,"" was commissioned by the CAB, which represents the majority of private broadcasters in Canada, and conducted through Winnipeg-based independent media economics consultancy Communications Management Inc.

The CAB says it's concerned about the fallout from a substantial erosion in local advertising revenues over recent months.

Radio stations may be hardest hit in the short term, the report suggests, partly due to many advertisers pulling back on their spending in the pandemic and hastening a decline in the media industry's revenues.

Private radio ad revenues are expected to be $383 million below last year, it said.

The report's projections suggest that without further government support those declines could mean as many as 50 private local radio stations go out of business over the next four to six months.

Another 150 radio stations could topple in the 18 months that follow, it said, leading to as many as 2,000 job losses.

TV stations could risk a similar fate with roughly 40 of Canada's 94 private TV broadcasters in danger of closing within one to three years, the research predicts.

The CAB is calling on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to take swift action by establishing a ""more fair and sustainable future"" for local media.

Last month, the organization sent an emergency application to the CRTC requesting permission for broadcasters to be relieved of certain terms of their agreements, such as spending requirements on Canadian programming, for the broadcast year that ends Aug. 31.

Lenore Gibson, chair of the CAB, said broadcasters have ""done their utmost to cut expenses"" in areas such as administration, and ""the last thing that they want to do is cut into programming costs, but that's the only area that's left now.""

The CAB is urging the federal government to provide emergency regulatory relief as well as greater ""targeted support"" for the industry starting this fall.

Without greater financial measures in place, the CAB says the effects could leave many communities with only national and international media organizations to provide them with most of their news, effectively eliminating most community coverage of local politics, health and education in some regions of the country.

This was Williams’ fifth match since professional tennis resumed amid the coronavirus pandemic after a hiatus of nearly six months — and all five have gone three sets. She is 3-2 in that stretch.

The result against No. 13 seed Sakkari, and particularly the way the match ended, was hardly promising for Williams as the U.S. Open’s start approaches next week.

The Western & Southern Open is usually held in Ohio but was moved to the U.S. Open’s site in Flushing Meadows this year to make for a two-event, no-spectator ""bubble"" during the pandemic.

In men's play, Canada's Milos Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Andy Murray. Raonic, from Thornhill, Ont., is the last Canadian remaining in the draw.

Williams was seemingly in control early, serving for the first set at 5-3, 30-0, when things began to unravel. She missed two backhands in a row, then put a forehand into the net to set up a break point, and walked over to the stand holding her towel at the back of the court (the ball people normally handle towels for players, but not during COVID-19).

That’s when chair umpire Aurelie Tourte called a time violation. On the following point, Williams sailed a forehand long to get broken.

At the ensuing changeover, the 23-time Grand Slam champion argued with Tourte, saying: ""I mean, I’m getting my own towels. That’s not fair. You should tell me on the sidelines next time if I need to play faster. Believe me, I will. ... You didn't even give me a warning.""

While Williams eventually did grab that set, she again frittered away a 5-3 lead in the second, plus a 4-1 edge in the tiebreaker. When she sat after the second set, the 38-year-old American tossed her racket over her shoulder the way an office worker might flip a crumpled piece of paper toward a trash can.

Williams came out flat in the third set, as if she’d rather be anywhere else. She double-faulted four times in the second game, including on Sakkari’s eighth break chance, to make it 2-0 and that was pretty much that.

Hours earlier, Novak Djokovic’s neck felt much better, and his tennis looked much better, in a 6-2, 6-4 victory over unseeded American Tennys Sandgren that improved the No. 1-ranked man to 20-0 in 2020.

""Actually, I’m pleasantly surprised with the way I recovered and felt today — just overall, physically, but also with the neck, specifically, because that was a little bit of a concern,"" said Djokovic, who will be eyeing his 18th Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open. ""Going back four, five days, I did struggle quite a lot.""

Djokovic was treated by a trainer and played sluggishly in his opening match Monday, but he was at his best from the outset against Sandgren and saved all four break points he faced.

Djokovic will face 34th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff in the quarterfinals. The other quarterfinal in the top half of the draw will be defending champion Daniil Medvedev against No. 8 seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Reilly Opelka, a 6-foot-11 American who is ranked 39th, delivered 19 aces and knocked off 2019 U.S. Open semifinalist Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 7-6 (4). Opelka next meets No. 4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, whose 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4) win over No. 16 John Isner was interrupted by a rain delay of nearly 1 1/2 hours late in the first set.

Also interrupted by the weather was Raonic's victory over the three-time Grand Slam champion. Raonic, a Wimbledon runner-up in 2016, has held all 29 games he’s served so far in the tournament.

""I have done the work,"" Raonic said. ""I have put in the effort, and I'm just happy that this quickly the pieces are coming together.""

This was Murray's first tournament appearance since November. He missed time due to a pelvic injury and is playing on a metal hip after two operations on that joint.

""Didn’t play well. It was not a good day,"" Murray said. ""The positives are that I got three matches in. Physically, I pulled up OK.""

Women’s quarterfinal matchups set earlier in the day were two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka against Anett Kontaveit, former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka against Ons Jabeur, and 83rd-ranked American qualifier Jessica Pegula against No. 14 Elise Mertens.

He was 5 under after the front nine Tuesday at Ozarks National when he hit driver at the par-4 10th. The ball wound up in such heavy rough that Mickelson couldn't find it, forcing him to take a penalty stroke. He still wound up making a long putt to salvage bogey, and that gave him some momentum for the rest of the round.

""I was able to get right back to even par on the back side with a birdie on the next hole, and then I made a couple more coming in,"" said Mickelson, whose 7-under 64 left him 17 under.

That was good for a four-shot lead over Tim Petrovic and Rod Pampling, who will be his playing partners for the final round. Mike Weir of Bright's Grove, Ont., (69) was nine shots off the lead at 8 under.

""I've been putting really well,"" Mickelson said. ""Today I didn't drive it the way I've been driving it. I kind of a hung a few drives, so I'm going to the range and try to work on that now. But when I come out tomorrow I'll try to be a little bit more aggressive with the driver and see if I can make a few more birdies.""

A few more? He's already made 19 of them in his first 36 holes.

Playing in the final group and with the shadows getting long, Mickelson picked up right where he left off after his opening-round 61. He made birdie at the third and then rattled off three straight beginning at the par-4 fifth, where he nearly chipped in for eagle.

Petrovic tried to make a run at Mickelson, but even one of his career-low rounds only got him so close. His putter went cold down the stretch and a poor approach at the par-4 finishing hole resulted in bogey.

Mickelson added a bridie at the ninth, the only hole he bogeyed on Monday, after a pretty flop shot over the bunker. After the lost ball at the 10th, Mickelson responded by adding two more birdies.

The second of them at the par-3 12th was a backhanded tap-in. His approach shot barely carried onto the front edge of the green, then nestled up to about an inch from the hole.

Mickelson could still squander the lead in the final round Wednesday, when tee times were moved to the early morning because of expected bad weather in the afternoon. But given the quality of his short game through 36 holes, the more pressing question is whether he could break the PGA Tour Champions' 54-hole scoring record of 191 — shared by Bruce Fleisher, Loren Roberts, Bernhard Langer, David Frost and Rocco Mediate.

Mickelson, who decided to make his debut on the over-50 tour to continue his U.S. Open prep after he was eliminated from the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, would need to shoot 65 in his final round Wednesday to move atop the list.

Petrovic and Pampling each shot 64-65 over the first two rounds. Rocco Mediate struggled coming in and was at 12 under.

K.J. Choi was another shot back, and Steve Stricker and David McKenzie were at 10 under.

Moments later, the Chicago White Sox right-hander threw the final pitch in a truly bizarre performance.

article continues below

A no-fan no-no.

With the seats at Guaranteed Rate Field empty, Giolito pitched the first no-hitter of the pandemic-delayed season, striking out 13 in leading the White Sox over the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 Tuesday night.

""2020 has been a very strange year,"" said Giolito, who conducted a postgame interview while wearing a mask. ""Obviously a lot of weird stuff going on with COVID and the state of the world, so may as well throw this in the mix.""

Sounds like he didn't mind that nobody saw it. Well, almost no one.

After right fielder Adam Engel extended on the run to catch Erik Gonzalez’s slicing drive toward the line for the final out, the hollers of Giolito’s teammates in the middle of the diamond echoed around the stadium.

""I’m just stoked for Lucas and so happy and ecstatic and emotional for Lucas,"" Engel said. ""It stinks we couldn’t celebrate the way most no-hitters get celebrated.""

The smallest crowd listed for any no-hitter in the majors over the last 100 years came in 1944, when a mere 1,014 watched Cincinnati’s Clyde Shoun beat the Braves at Crosley Field.

Nowhere close to that number on this night, not with the park that holds over 40,000 closed to fans because of virus protocols.

Suffice to say, years from now when White Sox fans fondly remember Giolito’s gem, there will not be, say, 100,000 or so people claiming they were there to see it in person.

At one point early in the game, some members of grounds crew drifted in sight, but that was about it outside of the teams.

An All-Star last year, the 26-year-old Giolito (3-2) matched his career high for strikeouts set in his previous start against Detroit.

Only a four-pitch walk to Gonzalez leading off the fourth inning got in Giolito’s way of perfection. That was only runner he permitted while throwing 101 pitches

""I’ve been working for this type of game for a while now and it’s really cool that we got it done,"" Giolito said.

Giolito relied on his changeup and fastball to make quick work of the Pirates, who came into the game batting just .229 and have the worst record in the majors. Six of their starters finished the game hitting under .199 this season.

The White Sox rushed toward the mound after the final out in Giolito’s first career no-hitter. Giolito hugged catcher James McCann as the Chicago players joined the party.

The South Side of Chicago normally rattles with fireworks after a home win -- this is the club that gave the game the exploding scoreboard -- but the park remained silent as the dugout emptied.

Giolito, meanwhile, was locked in his own zone in the later innings, fully aware of what was at stake.

""After the seventh, six more outs, looking at who I was facing, became very, very, very possible,"" he said, ""and then we were able to get it done.""

Giolito said his approach never wavered.

""Just staying with the same, like, mental routine for every single pitch. One pitch at a time. Full focus, full execution, straight through the target,"" he said.

Giolito pitched the 19th no-hitter in White Sox history — second most to the Dodgers' 23 — and first since Philip Humber threw a perfect game at Seattle in 2012. This was the seventh time the Pirates have been held hitless, with Washington’s Max Scherzer having done it in 2015.

White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson made a nifty play on a grounder by Bryan Reynolds up the middle in the seventh to preserve the gem, helped by first baseman Jose Abreu’s stretch at the bag.

In the ninth, Gonzalez hit a liner that Engel, a fleet centre fielder for most of his career, caught on the run at knee-high height.

""Yeah man, I think I got it,"" Gonzalez said. ""With that at-bat, I was a little bit mad because I don’t want to be part of history.""

Giolito improved to 30-28 in his big league career. He made his debut with Washington in 2016, then was traded after that season to the White Sox in a package for outfielder Adam Eaton.

Giolito gave up a major league-high 118 earned runs in 2018, his first full season in Chicago.

""I was pretty much bottom of the league in almost every stat,"" Giolito said. ""I kind of had to ... learn from failure to learn my true potential.""

He added: ""I always envisioned that I’d throw a no-hitter in the big leagues.""

Giolito threw the first no-hitter at Guaranteed Rate Field since Minnesota’s Francisco Liriano did it in 2011.

The White Sox, who’ve won eight of their last nine, ended the Pirates’ season-best winning streak at three games.

Giolito was dominant in his previous start, too, fanning 13 against Detroit and allowing just three hits in seven innings. The victory over Pittsburgh was his third career shutout.

Chicago’s first three batters reached in the second and all three came home one at a time after Engel’s groundout and singles Anderson and Eloy Jimenez. McCann added a sacrifice fly in the third off Steven Brault (0-1).

TRAINER’S ROOM

Pirates: RH reliever Keone Kela was available to pitch after leaving Friday’s loss to Milwaukee with forearm tightness. … Infielders Colin Moran (collision) and Kevin Newman (abdomen) also were on the bench after leaving Sunday’s game.

White Sox: McCann stayed in the game after being struck near his left hand by a second-inning pitch from Brault. ... Jimenez appeared to be getting treatment near the mound after the celebration, but manager Rick Renteria said he walked off under his own power.

LHP Dallas Keuchel (4-2, 2.65) looks for his third straight win Wednesday afternoon against Pirates RHP Trevor Williams (1-4, 3.70).

His team gave up a goal he felt shouldn't have counted three minutes into the opening period and had a subsequent equalizer called back on a razor-thin offside challenge.

Down 1-0 in the series and playing well, Tampa Bay then grabbed its first lead in more than 110 minutes of action midway through the third period only to see Boston tie it up with under four minutes to go in regulation.

""Adversity strikes in the weirdest ways,"" Cooper said. ""You never know when it's going to happen.

""Sometimes you're just dealt ... a sandwich that doesn't taste very good, if you know what I mean.""

And deal with it they did.

Ondrej Palat scored at 4:40 of overtime as the Lightning defeated the Bruins 4-3 to even their second-round playoff series 1-1.

Blake Coleman added two goals in regulation for the Lightning, while Nikita Kucherov had the other. Andrei Vasilevskiy made 22 saves to get the win.

""If there was one message that was going on it was we liked everything that was going on about the game,"" Cooper said. ""I know it sounds so cliche, but we just had to stick with it. Some teams, if you have mental weakness at all, you're probably sitting there saying, 'Poor us.'

""But it's just not been this group. That's not how they operate.""

Brad Marchand buried his second of the night to tie things with under four minutes left in the third period for the Bruins, while Nick Ritchie also scored. David Pastrnak added two assists for Boston, which got 36 stops from Jaroslav Halak.

The teams don't have much time to digest the result, with Game 3 of the best-of-seven matchup set for Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET back inside the fan-less Scotiabank Arena.

Tampa, which beat the Columbus Blue Jackets in quintuple overtime of Game 1 in the opening round before closing out the series in the extra period of Game 5 on a pair of goals from Brayden Point, got the winner after Boston couldn't clear its zone.

Patrick Maroon tried a wraparound that Halak stopped, but Palat was there to bury the rebound to score his first of the post-season and send the Lightning pouring off their bench in celebration.

""It's obviously big-time frustrating any time you lose a game and especially in that fashion,"" Bruins centre Sean Kuraly said. ""We thought we were trending in the right direction, (thinking) momentum may be swinging our way. You get the puck close to the blue line a couple times and you don't get it out, and against a good team that's what happens.

""It ends up in the back of your net.""

Acquired prior to February's trade deadline from the New Jersey Devils, Coleman gave Tampa its first lead of the series at 10:40 of the third after taking a stretch pass from Victor Hedman. The Lightning centre moved in alone on Halak and snuck an off-speed shot through the five-hole after getting slashed by Bruins defenceman Connor Clifton.

Boston, however, responded with 3:58 left in regulation when Marchand finished off a pretty passing play. With the Bruins in the middle of a change — Patrice Bergeron would normally be on the ice — Kuraly took a feed from Pastrnak and quickly found Marchand to bury his sixth and knot things up.

The Bruins, who triumphed 3-2 in Game 1 on the back of Halak's 35-save performance, took a 2-1 lead with 5:27 left in the second on a power play when Pastrnak faked a one-timer before sliding a pass to Marchand at the side of the net.

Tampa responded 56 seconds later after some great work from Point. The diminutive centre twisted and turned in the Bruins zone before finding Kevin Shattenkirk, whose shot was tipped in by Kucherov for his third.

The Lightning dressed seven defencemen with Ryan McDonagh (undisclosed), who has averaged a team-high 26:07 of ice time in the post-season, out injured after leaving midway through the third period of Game 1. Veteran blue-liners Luke Schenn and Braydon Coburn drew in, while Carter Verhaeghe was scratched up front.

Boston owned the best record in the NHL when the league suspended its season because of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, but dropped to the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference after losing all three of its games in the round-robin portion of the restart.

The Bruins found their groove in the first round of the usual 16-team playoff bracket, disposing of the Carolina Hurricanes in five games.

Tampa, meanwhile, had the second-best mark in the East and was fourth overall when the schedule was halted. The Lightning finished second in the round-robin and then downed Columbus.

The Bruins jumped out to a 1-0 lead at 3:14 of Tuesday's first period after Tampa defenceman Zach Bogosian's stick disintegrated at the offensive blue line. Boston broke the other way, with Ritchie stuffing his first past Vasilevskiy, who thought he had the puck covered — much to Cooper's chagrin.

The Lightning responded a couple minutes later when Barclay Goodrow tipped Coburn's point shot up and over Halak. The Bruins, however, correctly challenged for offside after Point was a fraction of a second too slow exiting the Boston zone on the tag up.

Cooper fired a number of expletives at the officials when the call was reversed, but was back smiling on the bench after a surprising burst from an unlikely source eventually knotted the score.

Bogosian, a bruising blue-liner known mostly for his physical play, split two Boston defenders, and as he was getting knocked down fed a diving Coleman, who slid his second past Halak before crashing into the net at 12:42.

""I saw Bogo picking up some speed,"" Coleman said. ""He just kind of had that look in his eye like he was about to do something. I just made it a point to get up into play with him, try to give him an option.

""He made a heck of a play.""

It was also the first sign the Lightning weren't going to be fazed by that early adversity.

""Any time there's a mishap, you just turn the page,"" Cooper said of his roster. ""It was needed tonight, I'll tell you that, because they need to be rewarded for the work they were doing.

""And in the end, they were.""

The All-Star guard scored 35 points and the Los Angeles Clippers rolled past the Dallas Mavericks 154-111 on Tuesday night to take a 3-2 lead in their first-round Western Conference playoff series.

George had shot 29% in the series and endured fans' wrath on social media. He said he spoke to the team psychiatrist before Game 5.

""I mean, whatever it was, the bubble got the best of me,"" George said. ""I was just in a dark place. I really wasn’t here. I checked out. The past couple of games, it was just difficult.""

George said it didn't feel like the playoffs until his teammates decided to create the atmosphere that was lacking inside the NBA's Walt Disney World bubble.

""I came in with that mindset that this is Staples, we’re at home,"" he said. ""The place is packed. I really had to psych myself up. I thought the whole team took that and we ran with it. We created our own energy. We decided to dictate this game.""

Kawhi Leonard scored 32 points and Montrezl Harrell added 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers, who set a franchise record for points in a playoff game. Los Angeles can clinch the series on Thursday.

Dallas' Luka Doncic, who hit a game-winner at the buzzer in Game 4 to cap off a 43-point triple-double, was held to 22 points on 6-for-17 shooting.

Dallas coach Rick Carlisle was ejected in the third quarter of the testy game, which included six technicals and a flagrant-1 foul.

Doncic said Clippers forward Marcus Morris might have stepped on his ankle intentionally early in the third quarter.

""I don’t want to talk to him,"" Doncic said. ""He’s just saying a lot of bad stuff to me all the game. I don’t want to talk to him. I’ve just got to move on. Like I said, everybody’s going to have their own opinion. I just hope it wasn’t intentional. If that was intentional, that’s very bad.""

Mavericks centre Kristaps Porzingis sat out with right knee soreness. It was the second straight game the 7-foot-3 Latvian missed.

Leonard scored 22 points and Paul George scored 18 to help Los Angeles take a 76-52 lead at halftime. The Clippers shot 61% in the first half and led by as many as 27 points.

The Clippers continued the onslaught in the second half, bumping the lead to as many as 45 points.

""Tough game,"" Carlisle said. ""Very poor performance by us. It was disappointing. It was very physical. We just need to have a stronger physical disposition to start the game and throughout. We’ve got to get some more traction at both ends of the floor.""

TIP-INS

Mavericks: Doncic was issued a technical foul in the second quarter. ... G Tim Hardaway Jr. was called for a flagrant-1 after winding up and hitting George in the face on a drive. ... Assistant Stephen Silas took over as coach after Carlisle was ejected.

Clippers: Shot 67% from the field in the first quarter. ... Hardaway and Morris were called for double technicals in the second quarter. C Ivica Zubac was called for a technical in the third.

BIGGER THAN BASKETBALL

Clippers coach Doc Rivers was emotional while discussing the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which has sparked national outrage and some violent protests. Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back while his three children watched.

""That video, if you watch that video — you don’t need to be Black to be outraged,"" Rivers said. ""You need to be American and outraged. How dare the Republicans talk about fear. We’re the ones that need to be scared. We’re the ones having to talk to every Black child. What white father has to give his son a talk about being careful if you get pulled over? It’s just ridiculous. It keeps going. There’s no charges. Breonna Taylor — no charges. Nothing. All we’re asking is you live up to the Constitution. That’s all we’re asking -- for everybody. For everyone.""

CARLISLE'S EJECTION

Carlisle described what led to his ejection. Hardaway had the ball at the free-throw line, and then Rivers was granted a timeout.

""My understanding in that situation is that once a shooter has the ball, a timeout cannot be called by the opposing coach,"" Carlisle said. ""I thought the call was wrong. So I was asking about it and wasn’t getting a great explanation and then it turned into a technical and then another technical. I’m just standing up for my team.""

It proved to be an excellent prediction.

Sales jumped to almost 38,000, more than the previous two years combined. McNamara had set the Thunderbird on a new size and class trajectory that would peak in the 1970s. It would also set his own career on a trajectory to the presidency of the Ford Motor Co. in 1960.

article continues below

The 1958 Thunderbird grew from its original length of 4,453 mm (175.3 in.) in 1955 to 5,217 (205.4) where it stabilized until 1966. It then grew to 5,331 mm (209.9 in.) for 1967.

The arrival of the 1972 sixth generation Thunderbird was the launch of its greatest period of growth, and its large step to a 5,436 mm (214 in.) length seemed to be just what the market wanted, boosting sales from 57,000 ’71s to 87,000 ’72s. This two-door hardtop (the only offering) was so large it shared its body-on-frame architecture with the Lincoln Continental Mark IV.

Underneath was typical American hardware with independent A-arm-and-coil-spring front suspension and solid axle on coil springs at the rear. Brakes were power assisted disc front and drum rear. The only transmission was a three-speed automatic.

Power came from the standard 7.0 litre (429 cu in.) overhead valve V-8 or optional 7.5 (460) V-8, both down significantly in power ratings from the ’71s. The 7.0 litre was listed at only 212 horsepower compared with 360 the year before.

There were a couple of reasons for the apparent loss of power. First was the change in the horsepower rating method from SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) “gross” rating to more realistic SAE “net,” i.e. as installed in the car.

The other reason was reducing compression ratios to accommodate the unleaded gasoline required by exhaust-cleansing catalytic converters.

There were none of the original sporting pretensions in the ’72 ‘Bird: it was a large luxury car pure and simple with a 3,058 mm (120.4 in.) wheelbase and nearly 2,032 mm (80 in.) width. It had the classic long hood/short deck profile and taillamps from wall to wall. Weight was a hefty 1,996 kg (4,400 lb).

For those who purchased cars based on mass and size it was irresistible.

Consumers loved the big ‘Bird and the millionth Thunderbird that came off the line was a 1972 model.

There were no big changes for 1973, except for an eggcrate grille rather than horizontal bars, and opera windows that slightly improved visibility. A further compression decrease reduced power to 201 for the 7.0 litre (426 cu in.) but buyers didn’t seem to care as long as they got their coddling luxury.

Unfortunately for Ford and other American auto manufacturers, disaster was on the horizon. The first “oil crisis” of the 1970s, caused by an Organization of Petroleum Producing Countries oil embargo would arrive late in 1973.

This tripled the price of oil, increased the price of gasoline and even more alarmingly, threatened its supply.

It reduced demand for large V-8-powered cars with the result that Thunderbird’s sales of ’74 models, now with the big 7.0 litre (460 cu in.) V-8 fell to 57,000.

Model lead times being what they are, Ford couldn’t turn the T-Bird around on a dime and 1975 and 1976 models were little changed. A “quick defrost” option promised faster window defrosting via a thin gold film embedded in the glass, but it proved to be a power hog and was discontinued in 1976.

The ’75s got optional four-wheel disc brakes, and thanks to government mandated five mph (8 km/h) bumpers it reached a length of 5,740 mm (226 in.), the longest Ford ever.

Times were turning against cars like the huge Thunderbird and 1975 sales fell to 42,000. But consumers’ memories are short and when the oil crisis ended, sales rebounded to 53,000 for 1976.

In spite of improved ’76 sales, it was clear the future lay in smaller cars.

With fuel economy legislation on the horizon, the Thunderbird would start shrinking with its 1977 seventh generation. It would get a six-cylinder engine, and even a four in the ’80s, much to the chagrin of many Thunderbird fans.

The 1972-1976 Thunderbird was caught in the transition to smaller, more sensible and economical cars.

It was the epitome of the big, garish models that made Motor City rich, dominant and some said even arrogant during the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s.

Those big ’Birds now stand as monuments to a more profligate era when gasoline was still cheap and bigger was better.

In an energy- and environmentally challenged world, it’s unlikely we will see their ilk again.

Asking a simple question can yield a very unexpected answer.

article continues below

Where would you park in a multi-level open air parking garage? This is the question I directed to a student driver. He said he would drive up a number of levels until he reached an upper level with very few vehicles. He would then take a space where there were no vehicles immediately left or right. His plan was more about not getting the doors chipped, and less about visibility when leaving a parking space. Out of the mouths of babes?

He then said the upper most parking level is one he would never take, given his dad’s bad experience with seagull excrement bombardment.

Social distancing has been adopted behind the wheel in more and more situations. Be mindful of your bubble. Many drivers now park away from the main doors of the mall, not because of a vehicle safety situation, but rather a health initiative. It is so much easier to back into a peripheral parking space than be on the lookout for the possibility of multi-directional vehicle contact. Drive-through spaces are always the best way of avoiding reverse gear.

There are many more single-occupant vehicles on the road since COVID-19. Drivers without passengers are the vast majority throughout the weekdays, with there being a slight increase in multi-person occupancy on the weekends. Multi-person occupied vehicles are more likely to be those in which the riders are wearing masks recommended by health authorities. This type of count was conducted over the last month and is far from empirical data, but more of a simple observation.

Car dealerships are sensitive to the singleton test driver, as opposed to the sales staff accompanying the prospective buyer. Wiping down the vehicle before and after such a drive is now mandatory for all such dealerships and associated businesses.

Space is no longer thought of as the final frontier, Star Trek style, but more as a degree of separation mandated by health authorities. This whole idea of allowing more space between people outside of one’s COVID-19 bubble has compatibility with the type of space cushion driving practised by many professionally trained drivers.

A driver will never hit a space, injure or kill a space. Space cushion driving is a lot like social distancing when walking. Spaces are used as escapes when drivers are threatened with an imminent but avoidable crash situation.

Social distancing can be a prelude to any driver’s lane choice. It can also be a factor in the route selection for those travelling to work or on related household duties. It is better to choose a path of travel which allows for wide shoulders and multi-lane escape potential, than narrow pathways where the only crash avoidance technique is to brake and hope.

The social distancing bubble is like the driving diamond. Picture one’s vehicle with an imaginary diamond shape around it. The driver would have a better chance of avoiding a crash by steering right or left when this predetermined and intended space is provided.

Lane choice and speed maintenance are important in maintaining such spaces.

The front and back space cushion of the imaginary diamond completes the similarity to the social distancing bubble.

Maintaining proper following distance will help avoid a rear-end crash, the most common of all crashes. The judicious use of the four-way flashers, to discourage tailgating, completes the space cushion driving practice.

This type of driving will give better protection to both pedestrians and cyclists. Always plan to have one side open and ready for escape when travelling in a lateral fashion with those biking and walking.

Breton said the additional provincial rebate makes buying electric cars more attractive in Quebec and B.C.
Transport Minister Marc Garneau was instructed in his mandate letter to do more to make the electric car sales quotas.

Transport Canada data obtained by The Canadian Press this week shows 75 per cent of the $300-million program has already been spoken for, just 15 months into its three-year mandate.

article continues below

The rebate, which provides up to $5,000 back on the purchase or lease of a new battery vehicle, or a battery-gasoline hybrid one, began May 1, 2019, and was supposed to run until April 30, 2022.

But as of July 31, more than $225 million had been paid out to 53,510 drivers.

""It's no surprise to me,"" said Daniel Breton, president of Electric Mobility Canada, a non-profit agency pushing for the electrification of transportation.

Electric car sales, as a share of overall vehicle purchases, have steadily grown from two per cent of all sales in 2018 to three per cent last year, and to almost four per cent in the first three months of 2020.

But the rate of uptake is heavily concentrated in just three provinces. Quebec and British Columbia, which have sales quotas for electric cars and provincial rebates on top of the federal one, together account for 86 per cent of all the rebates.

Ontario, which had a provincial rebate until 2019, accounted for another 12 per cent, with the remaining two per cent divided among the other seven provinces and the territories.

Breton said the additional provincial rebate makes buying electric cars more attractive in Quebec and B.C. but car makers are also shipping more electric cars there because their dealers have quotas for sales. Availability of electric models is limited, and many drivers have to wait weeks or months for one.

Electric Mobility Canada wants Ottawa to expand the program to include used cars and to increase the maximum purchase price of the cars that qualify for a rebate. SUVs and pickup trucks, which are more expensive, are set to come onto the market. In 2019, almost three in every four passenger vehicles sold were SUVs and pickups.

Cara Clairman, CEO of the non-profit advocacy group Plug'n Drive, says she hopes Ottawa will provide more money for rebates when the current allotment runs out because they are making a difference.

""I think we do need a few more years of it,"" she said. ""You have to look at it as a climate-change program.""

Canada has set targets to have 10 per cent of all passenger vehicles sold be electric by 2025, 30 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2040. Breton said that won't happen if the rebate isn't expanded.

Breton is also looking for the rebates to be extended to used electric and hybrid vehicles, which are now more easy to find than new ones in many cases. A 10-per-cent rebate on the purchase of a used electric car was mentioned in the mandate letter for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains last fall but has not yet been announced.

Transport Minister Marc Garneau was instructed in his mandate letter to do more to make the electric car sales quotas. Before the pandemic, he indicated he was looking at what more to do, including extending or expanding the rebate program. Something was expected in the March federal budget, delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Garneau's spokeswoman was noncommittal Thursday when asked if the rebate program would be expanded.

The 101 crashes at the almost completed McKenzie and Highway 1 project is somewhat predictable, but still a little odd. One would think the increased scrutiny throughout the construction phase would be cause for pause. The sheer volume of traffic of all types must have something to do with it.

The McKenzie-Highway 17 (Pat Bay Highway) merge area is No. 2 on the list, with 68 crashes. There are some not so obvious differences in this seemingly simple configuration. It is really a double merge and therefore not just a single lateral move that drivers must negotiate when heading west and entering from McKenzie.

The third highest number of crashes are at the Boleskine and Douglas intersection. This location has been a perennial top 10 contender. It is really the Highway 1 corridor with 62 crashes, but is rather seen to be a city street, as opposed to a provincial responsibility. Left-turn cheaters and a far-lane timing move might be the cause of so many incidents at a very standard type of intersection.

Sixty-one crashes were recorded at the five-headed monster, better known as the Hillside-Douglas-Gorge intersection. This is also a perennial placer in the not-where-you-want-to-be category. Let us all hope this returns to a giant traffic circle, asap, as in days long since gone by.

At least everyone would be going the same direction, eliminating the requirement for a left turn and the potential dreaded head-on collision.

Millstream and the Trans-Canada highway takes a tie for fourth (61) as a relative newcomer to the yearly tally. Westshore makes the big time, in a not-so-envious way. This is partly because of the amazing development as of late. It is possibly the fastest-growing place in Canada. The outsiders looking for a big-box fix can probably be blamed for the entry into the top 10 bumper-car type of collisions.

The sixth most common crash site is a mystery to me. After moving the bus stop at the Pat Bay Highway and Sayward Road, it was believed all was well in hand. The crash rate was significantly reduced, and we all thought this location would never again darken these pages. Well, it only took a few years and here we go again. The crash incidences at this location not only defy logic, but also make a mockery of the large capital expense thought to have solved the problem. Blame it on ferry traffic! Maybe visitors! Who knows?

No. 7 is a golf shot from No. 3. Blanshard and Saanich is an odd member of the top 10. It is a one-way location of Highway 17. One-way street locations are generally safer places. This one stumps me, unless it is once again the fault of the left-turn cheaters turning from Saanich.

Nos. 8 and 9 are in Nanaimo, namely the Island Highway at Bowen and at Mostar. Of all the disappointing locations to make the list, these two are the most difficult to understand.

They are on the same bypass road. Left-turn lunacy? Non-synchronized traffic lights? This is a total mystery to me. I am stumped. How about you? Wide open and lots of room! I never have any problems at these intersections.

No. 10 is a newcomer. Wale Road and the Island Highway is a non-right-angle intersection. What is it doing on the list? It just does not belong. Any thoughts?

Last week’s column about Richardson assumed the first iteration of a shared lane was the preferred option. This was incorrect. A non-through street barrier option was chosen instead, matched with two opposite flow lanes. Thanks to readers for pointing it out.

Alonso crashed in Turn 4 when his Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet dipped onto the concrete portion of the apron at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and sent the Spaniard into the retaining wall. His damaged car rolled onto pit lane for an early end to his afternoon.

Alonso was sixth on the speed chart when he crashed. He ended up ninth for the day.

""It is just the way it is,"" Alonso said. ""Fortunately it happened today and not on (race day). We will learn from this. Nothing we can do now and tomorrow we start again.""

Alonso is making his third attempt to win the final leg of motorsports' version of the Triple Crown. The two-time Formula One champion has victories in the Monaco Grand Prix and 24 Hours of Le Mans, with Indianapolis the only race missing from the trifecta.

He had a strong car in 2017 when he raced at Indianapolis for Andretti Autorsport but an engine failure ended his shot at victory. Alonso failed to qualify for the Indy 500 last year in an effort from McLaren.

He also crashed during Indy 500 practice last year and it contributed to the many setbacks the McLaren team had during its preparations. The McLaren backup car was not the proper shade of orange and Alonso lost valuable practice time as the colour was corrected.

Alonso's crash with just over 50 minutes remaining in Thursday's session was the first wreck since the track opened Wednesday for practice.

Meanwhile, five-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon topped the speed charts at the end of the day with a lap at 226.102 mph for Chip Ganassi Racing. He was followed by Takuma Sato at 225.693 and Marco Andretti at 225.249 mph as Honda's took the top three spots.

Conor Daly at 225.106 was fourth and the fastest Chevrolet.

James Hinchcliffe of Oakville, Ont., was 17th and Dalton Kellett of Stouffville, Ont., was 28th.

There is one more day of practice before qualifying, called ""Fast Friday"" as IndyCar gives teams a horsepower boost to increase speeds. Defending race winner Simon Pagenaud said Team Penske had a deliberate plan to work on handling Thursday and will worry about speed during Fast Friday practice.

""I have no interest in drafting and getting a big number out there,"" Pagenaud said. ""There's no interest for me to do that. I know I can win this race and I know what I need. That's more important than drafting and putting up a big number."""

Cole Pearn abruptly retired at the end of last year's NASCAR season after helping build one of the best teams in stock car racing. His life on the road cost him too much time with his young family and relocating from Colorado to North Carolina had limited their access to outdoor adventures.

They returned to his native Canada to operate Golden Alpine Holidays in British Columbia, a venture that has been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. Racing has also been scrambled, and when the Indianapolis 500 was moved from May to Aug. 23, one of the Ed Carpenter Racing engineers had a conflict.

It created an opening at Carpenter on Conor Daly's car. One of Carpenter's crew members had worked with Pearn before and the connection was made: Pearn, the crew chief of Martin Truex Jr.'s 2017 NASCAR championship season, would work the Indianapolis 500.

""They asked. It was like, ‘Yeah, why not?’"" said Pearn, who called the Indy 500 a bucket list event. ""It's hard when you race your whole life and just completely turn it all off. So it's kind of nice to scratch that itch at the same time.""

Daly, in his first day working with Pearn, was ninth fastest around Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The Chevrolet was even faster Thursday, when Daly briefly sat atop the speed chart before Takuma Sato bumped him down a spot. He ended the day fourth overall in speed.

""We made some really good changes overnight and Cole has an idea of what he wants to do. He's got an interesting way of working, he's like ‘Yep, I know exactly what I want to do,’"" Daly said. ""I really like communicating with him and I think we are vibing really well.""

Daly, making his seventh Indy 500 start, finished a career-best 10th in his hometown race last season while running for Andretti Autosport. A scrapper who has pieced together a full IndyCar season swapping between Carpenter for oval races and Carlin Racing for street and road course events, the 28-year-old Daly is trying to stabilize his career.

Daly will try to parlay a strong 500 into full-time work while relying on a part-time engineer in the 37-year-old Pearn.

""I’ve learned to just try to get along with everyone,"" Daly said. ""I’m a very trusting individual. Obviously, Cole has an incredible amount of experience in the racing world. Was a driver himself, as well. He knows what’s going on.""

Pearn's most noted success is in stock cars and a five-year stint as Truex's crew chief that produced 24 Cup Series victories. The team raced for the title three consecutive years, finishing second in back-to-back seasons after the 2017 championship.

Things began to change when Furniture Row Racing closed at the end of the 2018 season and Pearn and Truex were pulled into Joe Gibbs Racing. They won seven races and were runner-up to teammate Kyle Busch in the title race when Pearn decided he'd had enough.

He has since watched NASCAR on television and provides both insightful and comedic commentary on social media. Pearn recognized he missed racing.

""For sure missed the competition side,"" Pearn said. ""This is obviously a fully different experience, but racing is still racing. You throw a green and checkered.""

To prepare for Indy, Pearn took a very literal approach — ""I had to read the rule book,"" he said.

He's always followed IndyCar and his racing experience qualifies Pearn for the crossover that few expect will be a difficult transition.

""I grew up knowing these cars, it's not like it's anything crazy,"" Pearn said. ""In some regards it is kind of simple and it's just about understanding the procedures and how we set the cars up, learn how tech goes. The physics is honestly the easiest part, understanding how everything else works is the harder part.""

When Carpenter made the hire, he had no doubt bringing in Pearn would be seamless and give Daly a shot at winning the Indianapolis 500.

""I believe when you bring in smart and talented people that have a work ethic, they’re going to figure it out,"" Carpenter said. ""There’s a lot that’s different but a lot of the processes are the same. Some of the language is different. He’s definitely putting in the work to do it, getting prepared. A lot of what we’re doing at Indy is making decisions in the moment. I think we all feel like Cole has those traits."""

Loblaw Companies Ltd., which began offering COVID-19 testing for patients at a handful of its Alberta pharmacy locations in June, plans to expand the program to all 234 of its pharmacies in the province by Sept. 1.

The company says it has reached out to all 10 provinces to discuss in-store testing outside Alberta, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford this week acknowledging the possibility.

The swab tests are only for those with no symptoms or any known contact with coronavirus patients and may be useful for teachers returning to school or Canadians who take care of an older family member, said Theresa Firestone, head of health and wellness at Shoppers Drug Mart. Loblaw-owned pharmacy locations include Shoppers stores as well as Independent Foods and No Frills.

""It's very convenient. We're in every community. The other plus is they don't have to line up with people who may have symptoms. We've shared that with Ontario and with other provinces, so at this point we’re looking forward to what they may decide,"" Firestone said.

London Drugs also conducts COVID-19 tests in Alberta. It began offering the service at six locations during the past two weeks and plans to roll it out at nine more by October. Like Shoppers, it bills Alberta Health Services for testing costs.

The service builds on other responses to the pandemic such as online pharmacist consultations and a pilot program where patients consult virtually with doctors in a private room in the store.

London Drugs is among the pharmacy retailers beefing up their role in a health-care system grappling with an aging population.

""With the extended hours of operation, you can basically go in when our stores are open and be able to find a pharmacist to ask a question. So what we’re able to do at that point is basically help triage the system,"" said Chris Chiew, head of pharmacy at the Richmond, B.C.-based retailer.

London Drugs has also hired diabetes educators to test blood sugar levels and assist patients with weight management and diet.

Shoppers has stepped even further into the realm of physicians, opening one of three planned medical clinics with doctors who cater to a roster of patients and walk-in services.

""There are a number of Canadians who don’t have access to a family physician. And we thought there was an opportunity for us to really play a role here in terms of access,"" Firestone said.

Drugstores can also handle the bureaucratic side of health care, freeing up doctors to spend more time with patients, she said.

""Looking for PPE (personal protective equipment), sorting out their waiting rooms so that people are socially distanced, managing virtual care...we’re able to take that burden on for them,"" Firestone said.

In 2018, Shoppers launched its Wellwise store chain to sell assisted-living devices aimed at older Canadians. More recently, it began to offer tips and videos online designed to help ward off depression and anxiety.

Metro Inc. declined to comment on any attempts to provide COVID-19 testing. The bulk of the company's Jean Coutu drugstores are located in Quebec, which unlike some provinces does not allow pharmacists to conduct testing via nose and mouth swabs.

The Canadian Association of Broadcasters issued a report on Wednesday warning of potential closures and widespread job cuts as private TV and radio broadcasters face a cumulative projected revenue shortfall of up to $1.06 billion by the end of 2022.

Most vulnerable are the country's AM radio stations, the report said, as well as other independent private radio and TV operations in smaller markets across the country.

The study, titled ""The Crisis in Canadian Media and the Future of Local Broadcasting,"" was commissioned by the CAB, which represents the majority of private broadcasters in Canada, and conducted through Winnipeg-based independent media economics consultancy Communications Management Inc.

The CAB says it's concerned about the fallout from a substantial erosion in local advertising revenues over recent months.

Radio stations may be hardest hit in the short term, the report suggests, partly due to many advertisers pulling back on their spending in the pandemic and hastening a decline in the media industry's revenues.

Private radio ad revenues are expected to be $383 million below last year, it said.

The report's projections suggest that without further government support those declines could mean as many as 50 private local radio stations go out of business over the next four to six months.

The CAB is calling on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to take swift action by establishing a ""more fair and sustainable future"" for local media.

Last month, the organization sent an emergency application to the CRTC requesting permission for broadcasters to be relieved of certain terms of their agreements, such as spending requirements on Canadian programming, for the broadcast year that ends Aug. 31.

Lenore Gibson, chair of the CAB, said broadcasters have ""done their utmost to cut expenses"" in areas such as administration, and ""the last thing that they want to do is cut into programming costs, but that's the only area that's left now.""

The CAB is urging the federal government to provide emergency regulatory relief as well as greater ""targeted support"" for the industry starting this fall.

Without greater financial measures in place, the CAB says the effects could leave many communities with only national and international media organizations to provide them with most of their news, effectively eliminating most community coverage of local politics, health and education in some regions of the country.

""For us as a team we wanted to bounce back from Game 1. We weren't happy with that,"" said Pettersson.

""We played a good game. We should be happy about it but (we need) a short-term memory and be ready for Game 3.""

Goaltender Jacob Markstrom made 38 saves for the win while Robin Lehner stopped 22 shots for Vegas. It's the first time Vegas has allowed more than five goals in a game in the return-to-play tournament.

It was the first game back for Toffoli since the opening game of the qualifying round against the Minnesota Wild on Aug. 2. The NHL is not releasing information on injuries, but Toffoli had been seen in a walking boot.

Toffoli jumped over the boards for his first shift in the first period and scored nine seconds later, taking a cross-crease pass from Pettersson to put the puck into a yawning net. He then made it 2-0 on the power play, delivering a tape-to-tape pass to an incoming Horvat, who blasted it past Lehner.

""It's fun to get back in the lineup and get a big win and tie this series up,"" said Toffoli, who had been acquired at the trade deadline from the Los Angeles Kings. He had put up 10 points in his first 10 games with the Canucks before the regular season ended March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I made some phone calls yesterday, talked to a lot of people. It was a busy day,"" said Toffoli. ""It was good obviously getting the OK from everybody (to play). I got all excited. Felt like I was coming back to my first playoff series.""

Vancouver coach Travis Green said the 5-0 loss was their worst game of the playoffs and that Game 2 was a must-win.

""You go down two (games) against that team early in the series it would be tough and just mentally, too (to come back),"" he said.

""We were better with the puck, played a more direct game. I thought we were better on our feet, quicker. That's a good hockey team. I thought we did a good job of making them defend more than we did the first game.""

Despite being down by two goals in the second period, the Golden Knights looked like they were going to run the Canucks out of the rink again.

Markstrom kept the Canucks alive as Vegas tilted the ice and turned his net into a shooting gallery, blasting away for 22 shots in the period. Vegas got one goal back from Alex Tuch before Pettersson scored on a cross-ice feed from Alex Edler to make it 3-1 heading into the third.

""That really was a back-breaker,"" said Vegas head coach Peter DeBoer. ""You're down 3-1 and you have nothing to show for the work you put in to try and get back in the game.""

Tuch added: ""We knew Vancouver wasn't happy with the way they played last game and we knew they were going to come out flying. And we decided instead of being prepared, (to) be surprised by that for some reason.""

Vancouver iced the game 18 seconds into the third on Horvat's second goal. Then the frustration finally got to Vegas.

First, Max Pacioretty grabbed J.T. Miller by the head and threw him down after the whistle for a roughing penalty. Tuch got a double minor for pummelling Jake Virtanen while the Vancouver forward lay on the ice.

Pacioretty scored late for Vegas and Tanner Pearson added the final Vancouver goal into an empty net.

Horvat had not found the scoresheet since scoring two goals in each of the first two games against the St. Louis Blues in the first round.

Pettersson has been a steady point-getter throughout the playoffs but had been shut down by Vegas in Game 1, limited to no shots on net and one blocked shot.

Markstrom, in his first playoff series, has been the locomotive pulling the Canucks' playoff train. He allowed just nine goals on 121 shots (.926 save percentage) against Minnesota in the first round while registering his first playoff shutout. He saved 29 of 34 against the Blues (.930).

The series is being played at a fan-less Rogers Place. Players are isolating between contests to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This was Williams’ fifth match since professional tennis resumed amid the coronavirus pandemic after a hiatus of nearly six months — and all five have gone three sets. She is 3-2 in that stretch.

The result against No. 13 seed Sakkari, and particularly the way the match ended, was hardly promising for Williams as the U.S. Open’s start approaches next week.

The Western & Southern Open is usually held in Ohio but was moved to the U.S. Open’s site in Flushing Meadows this year to make for a two-event, no-spectator ""bubble"" during the pandemic.

In men's play, Canada's Milos Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Andy Murray. Raonic, from Thornhill, Ont., is the last Canadian remaining in the draw.

Williams was seemingly in control early, serving for the first set at 5-3, 30-0, when things began to unravel. She missed two backhands in a row, then put a forehand into the net to set up a break point, and walked over to the stand holding her towel at the back of the court (the ball people normally handle towels for players, but not during COVID-19).

That’s when chair umpire Aurelie Tourte called a time violation. On the following point, Williams sailed a forehand long to get broken.

At the ensuing changeover, the 23-time Grand Slam champion argued with Tourte, saying: ""I mean, I’m getting my own towels. That’s not fair. You should tell me on the sidelines next time if I need to play faster. Believe me, I will. ... You didn't even give me a warning.""

While Williams eventually did grab that set, she again frittered away a 5-3 lead in the second, plus a 4-1 edge in the tiebreaker. When she sat after the second set, the 38-year-old American tossed her racket over her shoulder the way an office worker might flip a crumpled piece of paper toward a trash can.

Williams came out flat in the third set, as if she’d rather be anywhere else. She double-faulted four times in the second game, including on Sakkari’s eighth break chance, to make it 2-0 and that was pretty much that.

Hours earlier, Novak Djokovic’s neck felt much better, and his tennis looked much better, in a 6-2, 6-4 victory over unseeded American Tennys Sandgren that improved the No. 1-ranked man to 20-0 in 2020.

""Actually, I’m pleasantly surprised with the way I recovered and felt today — just overall, physically, but also with the neck, specifically, because that was a little bit of a concern,"" said Djokovic, who will be eyeing his 18th Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open. ""Going back four, five days, I did struggle quite a lot.""

Djokovic was treated by a trainer and played sluggishly in his opening match Monday, but he was at his best from the outset against Sandgren and saved all four break points he faced.

Djokovic will face 34th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff in the quarterfinals. The other quarterfinal in the top half of the draw will be defending champion Daniil Medvedev against No. 8 seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Reilly Opelka, a 6-foot-11 American who is ranked 39th, delivered 19 aces and knocked off 2019 U.S. Open semifinalist Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 7-6 (4). Opelka next meets No. 4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, whose 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4) win over No. 16 John Isner was interrupted by a rain delay of nearly 1 1/2 hours late in the first set.

Also interrupted by the weather was Raonic's victory over the three-time Grand Slam champion. Raonic, a Wimbledon runner-up in 2016, has held all 29 games he’s served so far in the tournament.

""I have done the work,"" Raonic said. ""I have put in the effort, and I'm just happy that this quickly the pieces are coming together.""

This was Murray's first tournament appearance since November. He missed time due to a pelvic injury and is playing on a metal hip after two operations on that joint.

""Didn’t play well. It was not a good day,"" Murray said. ""The positives are that I got three matches in. Physically, I pulled up OK.""

Women’s quarterfinal matchups set earlier in the day were two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka against Anett Kontaveit, former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka against Ons Jabeur, and 83rd-ranked American qualifier Jessica Pegula against No. 14 Elise Mertens.

He was 5 under after the front nine Tuesday at Ozarks National when he hit driver at the par-4 10th. The ball wound up in such heavy rough that Mickelson couldn't find it, forcing him to take a penalty stroke. He still wound up making a long putt to salvage bogey, and that gave him some momentum for the rest of the round.

""I was able to get right back to even par on the back side with a birdie on the next hole, and then I made a couple more coming in,"" said Mickelson, whose 7-under 64 left him 17 under.

That was good for a four-shot lead over Tim Petrovic and Rod Pampling, who will be his playing partners for the final round. Mike Weir of Bright's Grove, Ont., (69) was nine shots off the lead at 8 under.

""I've been putting really well,"" Mickelson said. ""Today I didn't drive it the way I've been driving it. I kind of a hung a few drives, so I'm going to the range and try to work on that now. But when I come out tomorrow I'll try to be a little bit more aggressive with the driver and see if I can make a few more birdies.""

A few more? He's already made 19 of them in his first 36 holes.

Playing in the final group and with the shadows getting long, Mickelson picked up right where he left off after his opening-round 61. He made birdie at the third and then rattled off three straight beginning at the par-4 fifth, where he nearly chipped in for eagle.

Petrovic tried to make a run at Mickelson, but even one of his career-low rounds only got him so close. His putter went cold down the stretch and a poor approach at the par-4 finishing hole resulted in bogey.

Mickelson added a bridie at the ninth, the only hole he bogeyed on Monday, after a pretty flop shot over the bunker. After the lost ball at the 10th, Mickelson responded by adding two more birdies.

The second of them at the par-3 12th was a backhanded tap-in. His approach shot barely carried onto the front edge of the green, then nestled up to about an inch from the hole.

Mickelson could still squander the lead in the final round Wednesday, when tee times were moved to the early morning because of expected bad weather in the afternoon. But given the quality of his short game through 36 holes, the more pressing question is whether he could break the PGA Tour Champions' 54-hole scoring record of 191 — shared by Bruce Fleisher, Loren Roberts, Bernhard Langer, David Frost and Rocco Mediate.

Mickelson, who decided to make his debut on the over-50 tour to continue his U.S. Open prep after he was eliminated from the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, would need to shoot 65 in his final round Wednesday to move atop the list.

Petrovic and Pampling each shot 64-65 over the first two rounds. Rocco Mediate struggled coming in and was at 12 under.

K.J. Choi was another shot back, and Steve Stricker and David McKenzie were at 10 under.

Moments later, the Chicago White Sox right-hander threw the final pitch in a truly bizarre performance.

article continues below

A no-fan no-no.

With the seats at Guaranteed Rate Field empty, Giolito pitched the first no-hitter of the pandemic-delayed season, striking out 13 in leading the White Sox over the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 Tuesday night.

""2020 has been a very strange year,"" said Giolito, who conducted a postgame interview while wearing a mask. ""Obviously a lot of weird stuff going on with COVID and the state of the world, so may as well throw this in the mix.""

Sounds like he didn't mind that nobody saw it. Well, almost no one.

After right fielder Adam Engel extended on the run to catch Erik Gonzalez’s slicing drive toward the line for the final out, the hollers of Giolito’s teammates in the middle of the diamond echoed around the stadium.

""I’m just stoked for Lucas and so happy and ecstatic and emotional for Lucas,"" Engel said. ""It stinks we couldn’t celebrate the way most no-hitters get celebrated.""

The smallest crowd listed for any no-hitter in the majors over the last 100 years came in 1944, when a mere 1,014 watched Cincinnati’s Clyde Shoun beat the Braves at Crosley Field.

Nowhere close to that number on this night, not with the park that holds over 40,000 closed to fans because of virus protocols.

Suffice to say, years from now when White Sox fans fondly remember Giolito’s gem, there will not be, say, 100,000 or so people claiming they were there to see it in person.

At one point early in the game, some members of grounds crew drifted in sight, but that was about it outside of the teams.

An All-Star last year, the 26-year-old Giolito (3-2) matched his career high for strikeouts set in his previous start against Detroit.

Only a four-pitch walk to Gonzalez leading off the fourth inning got in Giolito’s way of perfection. That was only runner he permitted while throwing 101 pitches

""I’ve been working for this type of game for a while now and it’s really cool that we got it done,"" Giolito said.

Giolito relied on his changeup and fastball to make quick work of the Pirates, who came into the game batting just .229 and have the worst record in the majors. Six of their starters finished the game hitting under .199 this season.

The White Sox rushed toward the mound after the final out in Giolito’s first career no-hitter. Giolito hugged catcher James McCann as the Chicago players joined the party.

The South Side of Chicago normally rattles with fireworks after a home win -- this is the club that gave the game the exploding scoreboard -- but the park remained silent as the dugout emptied.

Giolito, meanwhile, was locked in his own zone in the later innings, fully aware of what was at stake.

""After the seventh, six more outs, looking at who I was facing, became very, very, very possible,"" he said, ""and then we were able to get it done.""

Giolito said his approach never wavered.

""Just staying with the same, like, mental routine for every single pitch. One pitch at a time. Full focus, full execution, straight through the target,"" he said.

Giolito pitched the 19th no-hitter in White Sox history — second most to the Dodgers' 23 — and first since Philip Humber threw a perfect game at Seattle in 2012. This was the seventh time the Pirates have been held hitless, with Washington’s Max Scherzer having done it in 2015.

White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson made a nifty play on a grounder by Bryan Reynolds up the middle in the seventh to preserve the gem, helped by first baseman Jose Abreu’s stretch at the bag.

In the ninth, Gonzalez hit a liner that Engel, a fleet centre fielder for most of his career, caught on the run at knee-high height.

""Yeah man, I think I got it,"" Gonzalez said. ""With that at-bat, I was a little bit mad because I don’t want to be part of history.""

Giolito improved to 30-28 in his big league career. He made his debut with Washington in 2016, then was traded after that season to the White Sox in a package for outfielder Adam Eaton.

Giolito gave up a major league-high 118 earned runs in 2018, his first full season in Chicago.

""I was pretty much bottom of the league in almost every stat,"" Giolito said. ""I kind of had to ... learn from failure to learn my true potential.""

He added: ""I always envisioned that I’d throw a no-hitter in the big leagues.""

Giolito threw the first no-hitter at Guaranteed Rate Field since Minnesota’s Francisco Liriano did it in 2011.

The White Sox, who’ve won eight of their last nine, ended the Pirates’ season-best winning streak at three games.

Giolito was dominant in his previous start, too, fanning 13 against Detroit and allowing just three hits in seven innings. The victory over Pittsburgh was his third career shutout.

Chicago’s first three batters reached in the second and all three came home one at a time after Engel’s groundout and singles Anderson and Eloy Jimenez. McCann added a sacrifice fly in the third off Steven Brault (0-1).

TRAINER’S ROOM

Pirates: RH reliever Keone Kela was available to pitch after leaving Friday’s loss to Milwaukee with forearm tightness. … Infielders Colin Moran (collision) and Kevin Newman (abdomen) also were on the bench after leaving Sunday’s game.

White Sox: McCann stayed in the game after being struck near his left hand by a second-inning pitch from Brault. ... Jimenez appeared to be getting treatment near the mound after the celebration, but manager Rick Renteria said he walked off under his own power.

UP NEXT

LHP Dallas Keuchel (4-2, 2.65) looks for his third straight win Wednesday afternoon against Pirates RHP Trevor Williams (1-4, 3.70).

His team gave up a goal he felt shouldn't have counted three minutes into the opening period and had a subsequent equalizer called back on a razor-thin offside challenge.

Down 1-0 in the series and playing well, Tampa Bay then grabbed its first lead in more than 110 minutes of action midway through the third period only to see Boston tie it up with under four minutes to go in regulation.

""Adversity strikes in the weirdest ways,"" Cooper said. ""You never know when it's going to happen.

""Sometimes you're just dealt ... a sandwich that doesn't taste very good, if you know what I mean.""

And deal with it they did.

Ondrej Palat scored at 4:40 of overtime as the Lightning defeated the Bruins 4-3 to even their second-round playoff series 1-1.

Blake Coleman added two goals in regulation for the Lightning, while Nikita Kucherov had the other. Andrei Vasilevskiy made 22 saves to get the win.

""If there was one message that was going on it was we liked everything that was going on about the game,"" Cooper said. ""I know it sounds so cliche, but we just had to stick with it. Some teams, if you have mental weakness at all, you're probably sitting there saying, 'Poor us.'

""But it's just not been this group. That's not how they operate.""

Brad Marchand buried his second of the night to tie things with under four minutes left in the third period for the Bruins, while Nick Ritchie also scored. David Pastrnak added two assists for Boston, which got 36 stops from Jaroslav Halak.

The teams don't have much time to digest the result, with Game 3 of the best-of-seven matchup set for Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET back inside the fan-less Scotiabank Arena.

Tampa, which beat the Columbus Blue Jackets in quintuple overtime of Game 1 in the opening round before closing out the series in the extra period of Game 5 on a pair of goals from Brayden Point, got the winner after Boston couldn't clear its zone.

Patrick Maroon tried a wraparound that Halak stopped, but Palat was there to bury the rebound to score his first of the post-season and send the Lightning pouring off their bench in celebration.

""It's obviously big-time frustrating any time you lose a game and especially in that fashion,"" Bruins centre Sean Kuraly said. ""We thought we were trending in the right direction, (thinking) momentum may be swinging our way. You get the puck close to the blue line a couple times and you don't get it out, and against a good team that's what happens.

""It ends up in the back of your net.""

Acquired prior to February's trade deadline from the New Jersey Devils, Coleman gave Tampa its first lead of the series at 10:40 of the third after taking a stretch pass from Victor Hedman. The Lightning centre moved in alone on Halak and snuck an off-speed shot through the five-hole after getting slashed by Bruins defenceman Connor Clifton.

Boston, however, responded with 3:58 left in regulation when Marchand finished off a pretty passing play. With the Bruins in the middle of a change — Patrice Bergeron would normally be on the ice — Kuraly took a feed from Pastrnak and quickly found Marchand to bury his sixth and knot things up.

The Bruins, who triumphed 3-2 in Game 1 on the back of Halak's 35-save performance, took a 2-1 lead with 5:27 left in the second on a power play when Pastrnak faked a one-timer before sliding a pass to Marchand at the side of the net.

Tampa responded 56 seconds later after some great work from Point. The diminutive centre twisted and turned in the Bruins zone before finding Kevin Shattenkirk, whose shot was tipped in by Kucherov for his third.

The Lightning dressed seven defencemen with Ryan McDonagh (undisclosed), who has averaged a team-high 26:07 of ice time in the post-season, out injured after leaving midway through the third period of Game 1. Veteran blue-liners Luke Schenn and Braydon Coburn drew in, while Carter Verhaeghe was scratched up front.

Boston owned the best record in the NHL when the league suspended its season because of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, but dropped to the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference after losing all three of its games in the round-robin portion of the restart.

The Bruins found their groove in the first round of the usual 16-team playoff bracket, disposing of the Carolina Hurricanes in five games.

Tampa, meanwhile, had the second-best mark in the East and was fourth overall when the schedule was halted. The Lightning finished second in the round-robin and then downed Columbus.

The Bruins jumped out to a 1-0 lead at 3:14 of Tuesday's first period after Tampa defenceman Zach Bogosian's stick disintegrated at the offensive blue line. Boston broke the other way, with Ritchie stuffing his first past Vasilevskiy, who thought he had the puck covered — much to Cooper's chagrin.

The Lightning responded a couple minutes later when Barclay Goodrow tipped Coburn's point shot up and over Halak. The Bruins, however, correctly challenged for offside after Point was a fraction of a second too slow exiting the Boston zone on the tag up.

Cooper fired a number of expletives at the officials when the call was reversed, but was back smiling on the bench after a surprising burst from an unlikely source eventually knotted the score.

Bogosian, a bruising blue-liner known mostly for his physical play, split two Boston defenders, and as he was getting knocked down fed a diving Coleman, who slid his second past Halak before crashing into the net at 12:42.

""I saw Bogo picking up some speed,"" Coleman said. ""He just kind of had that look in his eye like he was about to do something. I just made it a point to get up into play with him, try to give him an option.

""He made a heck of a play.""

It was also the first sign the Lightning weren't going to be fazed by that early adversity.

""Any time there's a mishap, you just turn the page,"" Cooper said of his roster. ""It was needed tonight, I'll tell you that, because they need to be rewarded for the work they were doing.

""And in the end, they were.""

George said it didn't feel like the playoffs until his teammates decided to create the atmosphere that was lacking inside the NBA's Walt Disney World bubble.

""I came in with that mindset that this is Staples, we’re at home,"" he said. ""The place is packed. I really had to psych myself up. I thought the whole team took that and we ran with it. We created our own energy. We decided to dictate this game.""

Kawhi Leonard scored 32 points and Montrezl Harrell added 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers, who set a franchise record for points in a playoff game. Los Angeles can clinch the series on Thursday.

Dallas' Luka Doncic, who hit a game-winner at the buzzer in Game 4 to cap off a 43-point triple-double, was held to 22 points on 6-for-17 shooting.

Dallas coach Rick Carlisle was ejected in the third quarter of the testy game, which included six technicals and a flagrant-1 foul.

Doncic said Clippers forward Marcus Morris might have stepped on his ankle intentionally early in the third quarter.

""I don’t want to talk to him,"" Doncic said. ""He’s just saying a lot of bad stuff to me all the game. I don’t want to talk to him. I’ve just got to move on. Like I said, everybody’s going to have their own opinion. I just hope it wasn’t intentional. If that was intentional, that’s very bad.""

Mavericks centre Kristaps Porzingis sat out with right knee soreness. It was the second straight game the 7-foot-3 Latvian missed.

Leonard scored 22 points and Paul George scored 18 to help Los Angeles take a 76-52 lead at halftime. The Clippers shot 61% in the first half and led by as many as 27 points.

The Clippers continued the onslaught in the second half, bumping the lead to as many as 45 points.

""Tough game,"" Carlisle said. ""Very poor performance by us. It was disappointing. It was very physical. We just need to have a stronger physical disposition to start the game and throughout. We’ve got to get some more traction at both ends of the floor.""

TIP-INS

Mavericks: Doncic was issued a technical foul in the second quarter. ... G Tim Hardaway Jr. was called for a flagrant-1 after winding up and hitting George in the face on a drive. ... Assistant Stephen Silas took over as coach after Carlisle was ejected.

Clippers: Shot 67% from the field in the first quarter. ... Hardaway and Morris were called for double technicals in the second quarter. C Ivica Zubac was called for a technical in the third.

BIGGER THAN BASKETBALL

Clippers coach Doc Rivers was emotional while discussing the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which has sparked national outrage and some violent protests. Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back while his three children watched.

""That video, if you watch that video — you don’t need to be Black to be outraged,"" Rivers said. ""You need to be American and outraged. How dare the Republicans talk about fear. We’re the ones that need to be scared. We’re the ones having to talk to every Black child. What white father has to give his son a talk about being careful if you get pulled over? It’s just ridiculous. It keeps going. There’s no charges. Breonna Taylor — no charges. Nothing. All we’re asking is you live up to the Constitution. That’s all we’re asking -- for everybody. For everyone.""

CARLISLE'S EJECTION

Carlisle described what led to his ejection. Hardaway had the ball at the free-throw line, and then Rivers was granted a timeout.

""My understanding in that situation is that once a shooter has the ball, a timeout cannot be called by the opposing coach,"" Carlisle said. ""I thought the call was wrong. So I was asking about it and wasn’t getting a great explanation and then it turned into a technical and then another technical. I’m just standing up for my team.""

Game 6 is Thursday.

Early this week, there was a flutter of consternation within the arts community over COVID-19, the virus that’s now reached pandemic proportions. By Thursday night, announcements of show cancellations — some of them last-minute — had swelled from a trickle to a fast-flowing river.

I first heard of this Thursday. That night, I was set to attend a performance of Lillian Hellman’s The Children’s Hour staged by University of Victoria’s Phoenix Theatre. Then Adrienne Holierhoek, the theatre’s publicist, emailed me with sobering news: the performance was cancelled.

“We’re not going ahead with a public performance, as we’re on the verge of the 250 limit,” she said. Holierhoek would now spend a busy night doing damage control.

She added wryly: “Let’s just say I’m having granola bars for dinner.”

As is the case with many performing arts companies in Victoria and throughout the province, the cancellation was in deference to a recommendation by B.C. health officer Bonnie Henry. On Thursday she suggested cancelling events expected to draw crowds of 250 or more to help contain the highly contagious virus.

That night, the list of cancellations continued to grow. Pacific Opera Victoria’s production of Flight of the Hummingbird, set to run Friday to March 22, is postponed indefinitely. The Victoria Symphony has discontinued its concerts. Dance Victoria says this weekend’s performances of Romeo + Juliet by Ballet B.C. are cancelled.

The Royal and McPherson theatres are closed until further notice.

Yesterday morning, I sat down to write a review of Busted Up: A Yukon Story, which played the Belfry Theatre’s Spark Festival. It’s a first-rate show and was to conclude its run tonight.

Later that morning, the Belfry’s communications director, Mark Dusseault, told me his company had made the difficult decision to cancel further Spark Festival performances. This festival, a showcase of new theatre, was originally to continue to March 22.

“It’s heartbreaking,” said Dusseault.

A decision had to be made quickly. One company was preparing to fly to Victoria from its home province of Newfoundland for Spark shows. The Belfry didn’t want them to invest effort, time and expense, only to learn their run was canceled.

Langham Court Theatre has cancelled today’s final performances of I and You.

Manager Michelle Buck said Langham Court originally considered capping the audience at 75 (the theatre’s capacity is 175) to allow for “social distancing” — that is, leaving physical spaces between attendees.

But in the end, the company — regretfully — decided to play it safe.

“It’s such a good little show,” Buck said. “It’s sad to pull it from underneath them.”

Dusseault, who has worked in theatre for 30 years, cannot remember a situation like this ever occurring before in Victoria. Yes, there have been other calamities: 9/11, the Gulf War, the global SARS outbreak of 2003. But nothing ever shut down the arts scene like COVID-19 has.

Not every theatre company has closed its doors. Blue Bridge Repertory Theatre says no upcoming events at its Roxy Theatre have been cancelled. The Roxy will host a musical tribute to the Beatles March 26 to 29.

It is, of course, disappointing for audiences when performances are cancelled. You not only miss out on the show, there’s the task of getting a refund. Yet for arts organizations, the fallout from this situation is much more profound.

Many companies scrape by to survive. Over the past 30 years, government funding has eroded. Audiences for opera, classical music and theatre are getting older. And in general, the battle for audiences is becoming much more intense.

For example, years ago, direct-to-consumer services such as Netflix didn’t even exist.

A new meme now making the social-media rounds suggests people holding tickets to cancelled shows should consider opting out of a refund. By doing so, you make a donation to the company in question.

It’s a noble notion worth considering. One potential legacy of COVID-19 is that it will shut down some arts organizations permanently. And once they go under, it’s difficult — if not impossible — to resurrect them.

Ours is a culturally rich city. During this difficult time, let us be aware of that, of the fragility and importance of the arts in Victoria."

For instance, there was John Green’s The Fault in Our Stars (2012), a young adult novel (subsequently a film) about a girl with cancer who falls for a boy suffering from the same.

And there’s the 2019 movie Five Feet Apart, about a young woman with cystic fibrosis who becomes romantically involved with an ailing young man.

Langham Court Theatre has just opened Lauren Gunderson’s 2014 play I and You. In this two-actor drama, Caroline, a high-school student with a serious liver ailment, receives a surprise visit from a classmate. Like a cactus flower in an inhospitable desert, young love ultimately blooms.

Caroline — feisty and smart — has never before met Anthony, a decent young man with a heart as big as Kansas. At the beginning, in true rom-com style, the pair spar and bicker furiously before bonding like Super Glue.

I and You was a hit, gleaning critical acclaim and enjoying well over 20 productions since it debuted. Gunderson has, meanwhile, emerged as one of America’s most produced playwrights.

Some will find I and You a touch jejune and sentimental in the manner of after-school TV specials.

A melodramatic surprise ending will leave you either thrilled or groaning. There’s a distinctly YA-lit vibe throughout this 90-minute play (I kept thinking of the classic line, “Stay gold, Ponyboy,” from S.E. Hinton’s The Outsiders).

An audience noticeably younger than Langham Court’s usual crowd responded enthusiastically to Thursday’s opening performance. Certainly this production of I and You, capably directed by John Han, has its share of strengths.

The show benefits from the talents of two promising actors. Jesse Deutscher (Caroline) and Justin Francis Lee (Anthony) offered well-rehearsed, energetic performances.

The detailed set is terrific — Caroline’s bedroom is stuffed with groovy teen detritus: vintage Elvis poster, lava lamp, cat-scratching post, retro-lamps and so on. Wide-screen clips of computer games and music videos work well; all light, video and sound cues were handled adroitly.

The play commences with Anthony, wearing a backward baseball cap, dropping in unannounced. He spouts a cryptic line that turns out to be a quote from Walt Whitman’s famous poem Song of Myself.

Caroline — a tiny girl in a too-big sweatshirt — is bewildered and frightened. Anthony hastily explains he’s volunteered to be her partner for a school assignment. Nonetheless Caroline, who is homebound because of her liver ailment, lashes out at the intruder for 20 or 30 minutes.

This introductory section is heavily salted with sitcom teen speak. “What is wrong with you, super hater?” says Anthony. “Walt Whitman can bite me,” says Caroline.

Eventually she does agree to a partnership — they’ll create a Whitman-inspired poster together. “How do you feel about glitter?” Caroline asks. “Philosophically I’m agnostic on glitter,” says Anthony.

It’s doubtful anyone outside a Neil Simon (or Lauren Gunderson) play actually speaks like this. Happily, about halfway through, the quip-fest subsides and we get to know the characters a little more.

Bon mots on the benefits of Chunky Monkey ice cream and Caroline’s toy turtle give way to heavier subjects. Anthony turns out to be a John Coltrane devotee; she digs Jerry Lee Lewis.

Caroline is a gifted photographer with a Whitman-esque love for minutia; he has just witnessed a terrible tragedy on the basketball court.

Deutscher, as Caroline, sometimes displayed flashes of nuance and a knack for subtle facial expression. And the more the playwright eased up on the shallow-end-of-the-pool banter, the more Lee was able to dig into the character of Anthony.

Gunderson intends to say something brave and refreshing about the fleeting, transcendent beauty of life — never a bad thing. And if I and You sends you back to that tattered copy of Walt Whitman poems on your bookshelf, so much the better.

The show continues at Langham Court to March 14."

The relationship between 3L, headed by Vancouver Island businessman David Dutcyvich, and the regional district has been fractious over the years as previous development plans failed to win support.

Stotan Falls on the Puntledge River has been closed to swimming in recent years by 3L, which owns the riverbed. For generations, it attracted locals to its hot pools carved out of the rock and to swim in the river. A toll booth was also in place on the nearby road for a time, and 3L and the district andp property owner have faced off in in the courts.Community organizations have formed in opposition to development.

The new development proposal submitted to the district went to the electoral areas services committee, which decided to sent it to other agencies for comment. The comments will inform the district’s board of directors, which will determine whether to take the plan to a public hearing. After a public hearing, the board votes on whether or not to support a proposal.

“The public need a solution on this,” said Rob Buchan, planning consultant and spokesman for 3L Developments.

“They want access and the regional district wants the land. We have to find a way to get to some ‘yes’ on this. I think there’s an enormous public-interest matter here.”

The new scaled-down proposal would cover 118 acres, allow for 335 single-family homes with secondary suites, 110 multi-family units, and include 15,000 square feet of commercial space as a neighbourhood centre, plus allotment gardens, Buchan said.

The developer is offering to contribute land to be used to build 40 affordable housing units.

Housing would be solar-ready and energy efficient, Buchan said.

Under the proposal, 49 per cent of the site would be donated to the regional district for park in the form of forested land, trails, and Stotan Falls, he said. About 100 acres would be dedicated for agriculture use, and the K’omox First Nation would receive 10 acres of land.

Buchan said that water and sewer services would be installed by 3L, which would hand over ownership to the district.

The developer is seeking to locate residential use to the north side of the river, which has been logged. Residential use is at this time slated for the south side.

The south side is unsuitable for development because it is split by B.C. Hydro transmission equipment and its penstock facility, which controls the flow of water, Buchan said. The forested south-side land would instead be part of the park.

The idea is to create a village on the north side of the river, within a rural agricultural area, he said.

To proceed, 3L needs amendments to the district’s regional growth strategy and to two official community plans, and new zoning approvals, Buchan said.

Buchan anticipates the matter will come before the board this fall.

If the board rejects the plan, 3L is prepared to proceed with permitted uses to log the land and extract gravel, he said.

The developer has an export permit for logs and he “would be commencing, he tells me, forthwith,” Buchan said.

Arzeena Hamir, an electoral area director, has not made up her mind on the proposal.

Within the community, “Historically the big issue has just been around conservation of forested land and the impact a development would have on that particular area of the community, which is beloved because Stotan Falls is located right there and it’s a big swim spot for the community,” she said.

Residents know the area for its beauty, forests and the salmon in the river, she said.

The restricted access to the falls is a “big concern for the public,” Hamir said.

The latest proposal has been altered as the developer addressed some of the concerns expressed previously, she said.

Health Minister Adrian Dix asked British Columbians to recommit to actions that have been shown to be effective in dealing with COVID-19.

“That’s our mission,” he said. “Our mission is to stop the spread.”

People are being asked to stay at least two metres away from those outside your social bubble, to wear a mask if social distancing is not possible, to regularly wash hands with soap and water, to not gather in large groups, and to avoid indoor gatherings.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said Monday that 269 cases were reported between Friday and Sunday, and one person died in a long-term care facility, for a total of 203 fatalities in B.C.

There are now 913 active cases in B.C. Another 2,594 people are being monitored because they are a close contact of an infected person.

To date, there have been 5,184 cases of COVID-19 in the province: 166 in Island Health, 2,739 in Fraser Health, 1,651 in Vancouver Coastal, 425 in Interior Health, and 127 in Northern Health.

Henry said the province has ramped up testing, with up to 5,000 tests being done every day.

However, she said, keeping the number of cases from increasing even more will require a collective effort to protect the elderly and those with a compromised immune system before flu season begins in the fall.

More fines against businesses and individuals in recent days is the right move if public health measures, such as limiting gatherings to 50 people and physical distancing rules, are not followed, she said.

“Showing support for each other, assuming the best and being an influencer for positive action is how we will get through this storm together,” Henry said. “And there are many more months of this to come.”

Owners of banquet halls have called on Henry to change the province’s 50-person limit on gatherings based on the size of a venue, but Henry said that won’t happen. “We know when there’s more people … the chances of somebody coming in with the virus and potentially spreading it go up dramatically,” she said pointing to parties that led to clusters of COVID-19 cases.

Large religious gatherings, some of them held in Alberta, have also led to more cases B.C., Henry said. “We need to hold the line that we’re holding and that includes any event, whether it’s in a banquet hall, whether it’s in a church or whether it’s in a restaurant or bar.”

Dix was adamant that rules won’t be relaxed: “The answer to the request is simply no, not because we don’t understand banquet halls or the services they provide but these are especially the kinds of events that we have to address right now.”

Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth introduced fines last week of up to $2,000 for businesses that flout public health measures and $200 for individuals who disregard safety plans or refuse to leave a premise.

Police in Victoria and Richmond handed out fines over the weekend of $2,300 to businesses, which included a $300 surcharge.

“We need to stay strong,” Henry said. “And we need to continue to use our basic steps or layers to live safely while COVID-19 is a part of our lives. We have the knowledge, and we have the skills and we have the expertise to protect our most vulnerable.

“But let’s keep going, doing our best each day. Each and every day. And let’s also continue to remember to be kind, to be calm, to be safe.”

2018

article continues below

Aug. 22: A New York court issues a warrant for the arrest of Huawei Technologies chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.

Dec. 1: Canadian authorities arrest Meng at Vancouver's airport after an extradition request from the Americans. The news becomes public on Dec. 5.

Dec. 6: China demands Canada release Meng and ""immediately correct the mistake"" officials made in arresting her. The Chinese say they were not briefed on the reasons for Meng's arrest. In Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Meng's case is part of an independent legal process with no outside political influence.

Dec. 7: Meng appears in a Vancouver court, where allegations of fraud are laid out. The U.S. alleges Meng misled American banks in a bid to get around American sanctions on Iran.

Dec. 8: Canada's ambassador to China, John McCallum, is summoned to a meeting with China's assistant foreign minister so the country can register complaints about Meng's arrest.

Dec. 9: China summons the American ambassador to China to lodge similar complaints about Meng's case and demand the U.S. rescind the order for her arrest.

Dec. 10: Chinese authorities arrest two Canadian men. Michael Kovrig, who was on leave from Global Affairs Canada, and entrepreneur Michael Spavor. Kovrig's arrest becomes public on Dec. 11. Spavor's becomes public on Dec. 12.

Dec. 11: Meng is released on $10 million bail. U.S. President Donald Trump tells Reuters that he would ""certainly intervene"" in Meng's case ""if I thought it was necessary"" to help forge a trade deal with China.

Dec. 12: China's foreign ministry says it has no information about Kovrig but says the organization he worked with — the International Crisis Group — was not registered in China, making its activities in the country illegal.

Dec. 13: Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, says the arrests of the two Canadians were plainly a response to Meng's arrest. China's foreign ministry says Kovrig and Spavor have been detained on suspicion of ""endangering national security.""

Dec. 14: Canadian officials are granted consular access to Kovrig, and McCallum meets with him in Beijing.

Dec. 16: Canadian diplomats in China are granted consular access to Spavor.

Dec. 20: Indictments unsealed in the United States allege two Chinese citizens targeted companies in Canada and around the world as part of a years-long hacking campaign to steal data.

Dec. 21: Kovrig's employer, the International Crisis Group, says he has not been given access to a lawyer while in custody. A source familiar with the conditions of Kovrig's detention says he is questioned three times a day and kept in a room with the lights on continuously. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland formally demands both men be let go, calling in a statement ""for their immediate release."" Similar statements come out from the United States, Britain and the European Union.

Dec. 24: China's foreign ministry calls out the U.S., Britain and EU, saying the trio should be condemning Canada for Meng's arrest.

2019

Jan. 3: At a news conference, China's prosecutor general Zhang Jun says Kovrig and Spavor ""without a doubt"" violated Chinese law. He says the investigation is also following the rule of law but doesn't provide more details about the allegations.

Jan. 7: The Prime Minister's Office says Trump has affirmed his respect for judicial independence. In a summary of a phone call between Trump and Trudeau, the PMO indicated the leaders discussed the high-profile U.S. extradition request — though Meng was not named — and agreed on the importance of respecting the independence of judges and the rule of law.

Jan. 9: China's envoy in Ottawa suggests Canada and its Western allies are white supremacists for calling for the release of two Canadians imprisoned last month by his country's communist government. Ambassador Lu Shaye makes the accusation in an op-ed in the Hill Times.

Jan. 14: Trudeau says he's very concerned to see China ""acting arbitrarily"" by applying the death penalty to a Canadian convicted of drug trafficking. He says Canada will do all it can to intervene on Robert Lloyd Schellenberg's behalf when a court in Dalian in northeastern Liaoning province announced it had given Schellenberg the death penalty after reconsidering his case.

Jan. 15: China expresses its ""strong dissatisfaction"" with Trudeau over his criticism of Schellenberg's sentence. Trudeau should ""respect the rule of law, respect China's judicial sovereignty, correct mistakes and stop making irresponsible remarks,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying says.

Jan. 16: The U.S. State Department says China's death sentence against Schellenberg is ""politically motivated."" A statement says U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Freeland spoke and ""expressed their concerns about the arbitrary detentions and politically motivated sentencing of Canadian nationals.""

Jan. 17: Ambassador Shaye says Canada's arrest of Meng was an act of ""backstabbing"" by a friend. Lu warns of ""repercussions"" if Canada bars the firm from its new 5G network for security reasons, as have three of its intelligence-sharing allies.

Jan. 18: Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale says the government's decision on whether to ban Huawei from being used in Canada's next generation 5G wireless network will not be influenced by threats of retaliation from China.

Jan. 22: China demands the U.S. drop a request that Canada extradite Meng. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Meng's case was out of the ordinary and Canada's extradition treaty with the U.S. infringed on the ""safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens.""

Jan. 23: Ambassador McCallum says there are strong legal arguments Meng can make to help her avoid extradition to the United States. Speaking to Chinese reporters a day earlier in the Toronto area, McCallum listed several arguments Meng's legal team can make in her defence.

Jan. 24: Trudeau dismisses calls to remove McCallum following his comments to Chinese reporters, saying such a change wouldn't help the two Canadians detained by Chinese authorities get home any sooner. Later, McCallum says he ""misspoke"" when he suggested detained Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou had a strong case to avoid extradition to the United States.

Jan. 25: McCallum tells StarMetro Vancouver it would be ""great for Canada"" if the United States drops its extradition request. ""We have to make sure that if the U.S. does such a deal, it also includes the release of our two people. And the U.S. is highly aware of that,"" he told the Star.

Jan. 26: McCallum resigns as ambassador to China at Trudeau's request.

Jan. 28: The U.S. Department of Justice formally levels criminal charges against Huawei, two subsidiaries and Meng. The charges, contained in two newly unsealed indictments, allege that Huawei misrepresented its ownership of a Hong Kong-based subsidiary to circumvent American sanctions against Iran. Furthermore, they say Huawei stole telecommunications technology, trade secrets and equipment from U.S. cellphone provider T-Mobile USA. Meng is charged with bank fraud, wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit both. In a statement, Huawei denied committing any of the violations cited in the indictment.

Jan. 29: The Canadian government says it has received a formal request for the extradition of Meng, who appears in a Vancouver court to change the people who are providing her with some of the financial sureties for her release.

March 1: The Justice Department gives the formal go-ahead for the extradition case to proceed.

March 3: Meng's defence team announces it has filed a notice of civil claim alleging ""serious violations"" of their client's constitutional rights.

March 4: China accuses the two detained Canadians of acting together to steal state secrets. Trudeau dismissed the allegation made in Chinese state media, saying: ""It is unfortunate that China continues to move forward on these arbitrary detentions.""

March 6: A lawyer for Meng tells a judge the United States bid for extradition raises serious concerns about the political motivations behind the case.

March 14: Huawei pleads not guilty in a New York court to charges accusing it of plotting to violate Iran trade sanctions. Lawyers enter the plea in federal court in Brooklyn, two weeks after Huawei pleaded not guilty to separate federal charges filed in Seattle accusing the company of stealing technology from T-Mobile.

March 22: A judge orders the RCMP to provide copies of the content on seven electronic devices owned by Meng after they were seized when she was arrested. Justice Heather Holmes of the British Columbia Supreme Court says the RCMP must make copies of data on an iPhone, an iPad, a Macbook Air, a Huawei phone, two SIM cards and a flash drive.

March 29: The federal government says it is considering subsidizing farmers hit by China's $2-billion ban on Canadian canola imports.

April 29: Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe says Ottawa needs to treat Chinese imports with the same scrutiny China is showing Canada's canola shipments.

May 1: The federal government changes a payment program for canola farmers to help those affected by China's decision to ban the Canadian product.

May 2: China suspends the export permits of two Canadian pork exporters, including Quebec-based Olymel LP, amid growing tensions between the two countries.

May 8: Meng's defence team tells a judge it plans to argue that she shouldn't be extradited to the United States because she hasn't committed fraud under Canadian laws and her arrest was unlawful.

May 9: Canadian diplomats are joined in a Chinese courtroom by American, British, French and German colleagues to watch an appeal in Schellenberg's case.

May 16: China says it has formally arrested Kovrig and Spavor, bringing them closer to trial on vaguely defined state security charges. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman says they have been arrested for allegedly stealing state secrets. Goodale says the federal government is ""deeply concerned"" about China's decision, adding that no evidence has been produced to indicate any validity to allegations made against them.

May 23: China's ambassador to Canada says the bilateral relationship is at ""rock bottom"" compared to any time since diplomatic ties were first established decades ago. In prepared text for a speech, Lu Shaye says he's saddened Canada-China relations are at what he called a ""freezing point.""

June 5: Lawyers for the RCMP and Canada Border Services Agency deny allegations that their officers searched Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou's phones and electronic devices after a border official wrote down her passwords. A joint response filed in court to Meng's civil lawsuit says a border officer asked Meng for her phone numbers and passwords in case he was required to search the devices for customs or immigration purposes. Meng's civil lawsuit filed in B.C. Supreme Court alleges ""serious violations"" of her constitutional rights and accuses officers of detaining and questioning her for three hours before notifying her of her arrest.

June 13: Freeland rejects the purported view of former prime minister Jean Chretien that the extradition request be cancelled to improve relations with China and win the release of Kovrig and Spavor. Freeland said while she respects Chretien, Canada is either a rule of law country or it is not. Chretien's comments were reported in the Globe and Mail citing anonymous sources.

June 24: Defence lawyers for Meng ask Ottawa to stop the extradition process against their client, saying the request made by the United States was for political purposes, not legitimate law enforcement reasons.

Aug. 20: Court documents released ahead of Meng's extradition hearing suggest a Canadian border official questioned her about her business before the RCMP arrested her. The nearly 1,100 pages of material released by the court were collected by Meng's defence team.

Aug. 21: Meng's lawyers allege Canadian officials acted as ""agents"" of American law enforcement while she was detained at Vancouver's airport for three hours ahead of her arrest. In court documents, they point to handwritten notes by Canadian officers indicating Meng's electronics were collected in anticipation of a request from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States.

Sept. 4. Business consultant Dominic Barton is named as Canada's new ambassador to China.

Sept. 23: The Crown says Canadian officials followed the law when they detained Meng and the defence has no proof to substantiate its ""conspiracy theory"" that she was illegally arrested. The Attorney General of Canada says in court documents that there's no evidence to suggest that the RCMP or the FBI asked border agents to elicit information from Meng during the detainment.

Sept. 24: A lawyer for Meng says there was nothing ""routine"" about the way she was questioned by border officials before she was read her rights and informed of her arrest as Meng's defence team asks the B.C. Supreme Court to compel the release of further documents to support its arguments ahead of her extradition hearing in January.

Oct. 1: A Crown prosecutor tells a judge Canadian border guards mistakenly gave the RCMP passcodes to electronic devices belonging to Meng when she was questioned at the Vancouver airport. The Crown says when the border agency realized it had made a mistake, it told the RCMP the codes could not be used or shared because they'd been obtained during a border examination.

Oct. 29: The federal government says Canada's new ambassador to China has met with Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

Oct. 31: In documents, Meng's lawyers maintain there is an ""air of reality"" to an allegation the RCMP illegally shared details of her electronic devices with the FBI, despite new affidavits from the Mounties denying the claim.

Nov. 5. A Chinese ban on the import of Canadian pork and beef products estimated to have cost farmers almost $100 million is lifted.

Nov. 24: Canada's new foreign affairs minister spends an hour in talks with his Chinese counterpart over the fate of Kovrig and Spavor. Francois-Philippe Champagne spoke with China's Wang Yi a day earlier at a G20 meeting of foreign ministers in Japan.

Nov. 28: Lawyers for Meng say the United States is ""dressing up"" its complaint that she violated sanctions as a case of fraud as they ask the B.C. Supreme Court to decline her extradition. In court documents released, Meng's legal team says the alleged misrepresentation does not amount to fraud and the transactions processed by HSBC were not illegal in Canada.

Dec. 2: Meng says she has experienced feelings of helplessness, torment and struggle since being arrested, but no longer fears the unknown. In a post on the Chinese telecom company's website, Meng says she has passed the time on bail in one of her homes in Vancouver reading books, chatting with colleagues and painting.

Dec. 10: Justice Minister David Lametti says he is troubled that Kovrig and Spavor have been denied access to lawyers as they face trials where convictions are virtually assured. Meanwhile, Meng wins an application in the B.C. Supreme Court for more documents to be disclosed as she alleges there was an abuse of process during her arrest.

2020

Jan. 23: A lawyer for Meng argues the extradition case against her is a test of whether courts will reject foreign charges that run contrary to Canadian values as a hearing wrapped up in the B.C. Supreme Court. The hearing focused on the legal test of double criminality. Crown counsel Robert Frater says the judge does not necessarily need to consider American sanctions law for the allegations to amount to fraud in Canada.

March 13: Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese Embassy in Canada says Kovrig has been allowed to have a telephone conversation with his father, who is very ill. The embassy says in a statement that they allowed the call for humanitarian reasons, and it also says Kovrig and fellow detainee Michael Spavor are being given better food to strengthen their immunity against the novel coronavirus.

May 27: Holmes rules against Meng on the double-criminality argument. The B.C. Supreme Court judge says the allegations against Meng could constitute a crime in Canada.

June 15: Lawyers for Meng accuse authorities in the United States of misleading the B.C. Supreme Court judge presiding over the extradition case. Meng's defence team says it is seeking a stay in the proceedings arguing that U.S. case records are ""grossly inaccurate and based on deliberate and/or reckless misstatements of fact and material omissions, thereby constituting a serious abuse of the extradition process.""

June 19: China charges Kovrig and Spavor with spying. Kovrig was charged in Beijing on suspicion of spying for state secrets and intelligence. Spavor was charged in Dandong city near the North Korean border on suspicion of spying for a foreign entity and illegally providing state secrets.

Aug. 25: Meng loses her battle to have the contents of six confidential documents released to her legal team after arguing in Federal Court that the redacted documents would support the position that their client suffered an abuse of process during her arrest. Justice Catherine Kane says the information contained in the documents is not relevant to the allegations of abuse described by Meng's legal team.

Authorities implored coastal residents of Texas and Louisiana to evacuate and worried that not enough had fled.

The storm grew nearly 70% in power in just 24 hours to a size the National Hurricane Center called ""extremely dangerous."" Drawing energy from the warm Gulf of Mexico waters, the system was on track to arrive late Wednesday or early Thursday as the most powerful hurricane to strike the U.S. so far this year.

""It looks like it’s in full beast mode,"" said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy. ""Which is not what you want to see if you’re in its way.""

One major Louisiana highway already had standing water as Laura's outer bands moved ashore. Winds began picking up as shoppers rushed into a grocery store in low-lying Delcambre, filling carts with chips and beer. Austin Domingues, 26, said his wife would likely evacuate, but he planned to stay put at his father's farm, where the house is 14 feet off the ground.

""I don’t know if it’s too smart, but we’re going to stay just in case we need to help people out,"" he said.

With time running out, both Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards expressed concerns that not enough coastal residents were taking the dire predictions seriously. In Lake Charles, National Guard members drove school buses around neighbourhoods, offering to pick up families.

Abbott warned that families who do not get out of harm's way could be cut off from help long after the storm makes landfall overnight.

The National Hurricane Center kept raising its estimate of Laura's storm surge, from 10 feet just a couple of days ago to twice that size — a height that forecasters said would be especially deadly.

A Category 4 hurricane can cause damage so catastrophic that power outages may last for months in places, and wide areas could be uninhabitable for weeks or months. The threat of such devastation posed a new disaster-relief challenge for a government already straining to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.

By Wednesday afternoon, Laura had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (225 kph) as it churned about 200 miles (320 kilometres) from Lake Charles, Louisiana, moving northwest at 16 mph (26 kph). Forecasters predict winds will reach at least 145 mph winds but may weaken ever so slightly before landfall.

""Heed the advice of your local authorities. If they tell you to go, go! Your life depends on it today,"" said Joel Cline, tropical program co-ordinator at the National Weather Service. ""It’s a serious day and you need to listen to them.""

On Twitter, President Donald Trump also urged coastal residents to heed local officials. Hurricane warnings were issued from San Luis Pass, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, and reached inland for 200 miles (322 kilometres). Storm surge warnings were in effect from Freeport, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River.

In the largest U.S. evacuation during this pandemic era, more than half a million people were ordered to flee from their homes near the Texas-Louisiana state line, including the Texas cities of Beaumont, Galveston and Port Arthur, and the low-lying Calcasieu and Cameron parishes in southwestern Louisiana, where forecasters said storm surge topped by waves could submerge entire towns.

Edwards lamented that the impending storm meant suspension of community testing for COVID-19 at a crucial time — as elementary and secondary schools in Louisiana are opening and students are returning to college campuses. ""We’re basically going to be blind for this week,"" Edwards said, referring to the lack of testing.

The storm also forced evacuations from an area of the state where there has been a high rate of positive tests.

A National Weather Service meteorologist in Lake Charles, Louisiana — in the bullseye of Laura’s projected path — took to Facebook Live to deliver an urgent warning for people living south of Interstate 10 in southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas.

""Your life will be in immediate and grave danger beginning this evening if you do not evacuate,"" Donald Jones said.

Laura is expected to dump massive rainfall as it moves inland, causing widespread flash flooding in states far from the coast. Flood watches were issued for much of Arkansas, and forecasters said heavy rainfall could arrive by Friday in parts of Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky. Laura is so powerful that it's expected to become a tropical storm again once it reaches the Atlantic Ocean, potentially menacing the Northeast.

Even before dawn Wednesday, officials in Austin said the city had run out of free hotel rooms to offer evacuees and had begun directing families fleeing the storm to a shelter nearly 200 miles farther north. In Texas’ Hardin County, which has more than 57,000 residents along the coast, officials warned that anyone who tried riding out the storm faced days or weeks without electricity.

Becky Clements, 56, evacuated from Lake Charles after hearing that it could suffer a direct hit, almost exactly 15 years after Hurricane Rita destroyed the city. She and her family found an AirBnb hundreds of miles inland.

""The devastation afterward in our town and that whole corner of the state was just awful,"" Clements said. ""Whole communities were washed away, never to exist again. ... So knowing how devastating the storms are, there was no way we were going to stay for this.""

Clements, a church educator, said she fears for her office, which is in a trailer following recent construction.

""I very much anticipate that my office will be gone when I get back. It will be scattered throughout that field.""

The hurricane also threatens a centre of the U.S. energy industry. The government said 84% of Gulf oil production and an estimated 61% of natural gas production were shut down. Nearly 300 platforms have been evacuated. Consumers are unlikely to see big price hikes however, because the pandemic has decimated demand for fuel.

""If Laura moves further west toward Houston, there will be a much bigger gasoline supply problem,"" Oil analyst Andrew Lipow said, since refineries usually take two to three weeks to resume full operations.

Laura closed in on the U.S. after killing nearly two dozen people on the island of Hispaniola, including 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.

Kyle Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, was taken into custody in Illinois on suspicion of first-degree intentional homicide. Antioch is about 15 miles from Kenosha.

Two people were shot to death Tuesday night in an attack carried out by a young white man who was caught on cellphone video opening fire in the middle of the street with a semi-automatic rifle.

""I just killed somebody,"" the gunman could be heard saying at one point during the shooting rampage that erupted just before midnight.

One victim was shot in the head and the other in the chest, Sheriff David Beth told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. A third person suffered gunshot wounds not believed to be life-threatening.

In the wake of the killings, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers authorized 500 members of the National Guard to support local law enforcement around Kenosha, doubling the number of troops sent in. The governor's office said he working other states to bring in additional National Guard troops and law officers.

""We were all chanting ‘Black lives matter’ at the gas station and then we heard, boom, boom, and I told my friend, `‘That’s not fireworks,’"" 19-year-old protester Devin Scott told the Chicago Tribune. ""And then this guy with this huge gun runs by us in the middle of the street and people are yelling, ‘He shot someone! He shot someone!’ And everyone is trying to fight the guy, chasing him and then he started shooting again.""

Scott said he cradled a lifeless victim in his arms, and a woman started performing CPR, but ""I don’t think he made it.""

According to witness accounts and video footage, police apparently let the young man responsible for the shootings walk past them with a rifle over his shoulder as members of the crowd were yelling for him to be arrested because he had shot people.

Much of Rittenhouse’s Facebook page is devoted to praising law enforcement, with references to Blue Lives Matter, a movement that supports police. He also can be seen holding an assault rifle.

Other photographs include those of badges of various law enforcement agencies, including the Chicago Police Department. All of the badges have a black line across them — something police officers do with black tape or another material whenever an officer is killed in the line of duty.

In a photograph posted by his mother, he is wearing what appears to be a blue law enforcement uniform as well as the kind of brimmed hat that state troopers wear.

The sheriff told the Journal Sentinel that armed people had been patrolling the city's streets in recent nights, but he did not know if the gunman was among them.

""They’re a militia,"" Beth said. ""They’re like a vigilante group.""

The FBI said it is assisting in the case.

Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who is Black, said in an interview with the news program ""Democracy Now!"" that the shootings were not surprising and that white militias have been ignored for too long.

""How many times across this country do you see armed gunmen, protesting, walking into state Capitols, and everybody just thinks it’s OK?"" Barnes said. ""People treat that like it’s some kind of normal activity that people are walking around with assault rifles.""

Witness accounts and video show that the shootings took place in two stages: The gunman first shot someone at a car lot, then jogged away, stumbled and fell in the street, and opened fire again as members of the crowd closed in him.

A witness, Julio Rosas, 24, said that when the gunman stumbled, ""two people jumped onto him and there was a struggle for control of his rifle. At that point during the struggle, he just began to fire multiple rounds and that dispersed people near him.""

""The rifle was being jerked around in all directions while it was being fired,"" Rosas said.

Sam Dirks, 22, from Milwaukee, said he had seen the suspected gunman earlier in the evening, and he was yelling at some of the protesters.

""He was definitely very agitated. He was pacing around, just pointing his gun in general. Not necessarily at anyone specifically,"" Dirks said.

In other widely circulating video, police can be seen tossing bottled water from an armoured vehicle to what appear to be armed civilians walking the streets. One of the civilians appears to be the gunman who later shot protesters.

""We appreciate you being here,"" an officer is heard saying to the group over a loudspeaker.

In Wisconsin, it is legal for people 18 and over to openly carry a gun, with no license required.

Blake, 29, was shot, apparently in the back, on Sunday as he leaned into his SUV, three of his children seated inside. Kenosha police have said little about what happened other than that they were responding to a domestic dispute. They have not said why the officers opened fire or whether Blake was armed, and they have not disclosed the race of three officers on the scene.

On Tuesday, Ben Crump, the lawyer for Blake’s family, said it would ""take a miracle"" for Blake to walk again. He called for the officer who opened fire to be arrested and for the others involved to lose their jobs.

The shooting was captured on cellphone video and ignited new protests in the U.S. three months after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer touched off a nationwide reckoning over racial injustice.

During the unrest in Kenosha since then, protesters destroyed dozens of buildings, set fires and hurled objects at police, who responded with tear gas on three straight nights.

Me in a T-shirt and a pair of walking shorts — God forbid anybody see me in walking shorts — that just doesn't do it.""","Thomas King says he takes pleasure in planning vacations. He just doesn't like going on them.

The acclaimed author said he enjoys searching the web for must-see sites of a far-off city, checking out the availability of flights and hotels, and calculating the cost of his travel itinerary.

article continues below

But when it comes time to book, King would rather see the world from the comfort of his home in Guelph, Ont.

""I can have a little espresso at my desk, and look all this stuff up, and it often feels like I've travelled there,"" King, 77, said in a recent phone interview.

""If I don't travel again, I don't know that I'll miss it.""

This weariness of wanderlust animates King's new novel, ""Indians on Vacation,"" which hit shelves Tuesday.

The story follows Canadian couple Mimi and Bird on a peripatetic mission across Europe to recover a family medicine bundle that a long-lost relative absconded with a century earlier.

As they drift from one destination to the next, the two must navigate their conflicting tourist temperaments.

Mimi, with her trusty guidebook in hand, believes that travel is ""broadening."" Meanwhile, Bird, like the book's author, is skeptical that there's much to be gained by straying too far from home.

""When we travel, a lot of times, the thing we come away with is we've been entertained,"" said King.

""I don't know that we feel any differently towards the people that we see on our travels. We find them interesting, sometimes even exotic. And for a moment, perhaps we have a kind of broadening. But I think by the time people get home, that's tightened up again.""

If anything, travel can show that prejudice knows no borders, said King, who was born in the U.S. and is of Greek and Cherokee descent.

From mountain towns to major cities, King said he's often confronted by racist stereotypes of Indigenous Peoples while abroad, including a photographer in France who asked him to pose with a pool stick as if it were a spear.

""What they want is that inauthentic historical image that Hollywood has made up over the years,"" said King.

""It's always the one kind of Indian they've got because the others don't play well visually. Me in a T-shirt and a pair of walking shorts — God forbid anybody see me in walking shorts — that just doesn't do it.""

In writing ""Indians on Vacation,"" King said he wanted to ""play against type"" by depicting Indigenous characters who are well-off enough to travel the world, while still engaging with the historic inequities that have made such portrayals a rarity in popular culture.

As the COVID-19 pandemic has closed down borders, King won't have to endure airplane food, forced photo-ops or guided walking tours any time soon.

But he still longs for a time when he could plan his dream vacation — then decide not to take it of his own accord.

""I don't need to go to Ireland,"" King said. ""But I don't like the fact that I can't.""

The lengthy report from the Special Investigations Unit notes that Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked ""important conversations"" about the ways in which police interact with Black and Indigenous people, but says there was no evidence of police wrongdoing or ""overt"" racism in the incident itself.

article continues below

Director Joseph Martino said race may have been a factor in the events leading up to the death of the 29-year-old, who was both Indigenous and Black, but that examining systemic issues in policing is not his role.

""The task before me was a narrow one — namely, to determine whether there were reasonable grounds, on the evidence collected by the SIU, to believe that any one or more of the officers who responded to Ms. Korchinski-Paquet's apartment committed a criminal offence in connection with her death,"" he wrote.

The Special Investigations Unit said six officers were in the 29-year-old woman's Toronto home when she fell from the balcony in May, while her mother and brother were nearby.

The agency's report says Korchinski-Paquet's mother called police to the home because the two siblings were fighting — ""bottles and punches had been thrown"" — and she wanted both of them removed from the apartment.

It says Korchinski-Paquet and her brother also called 911 during the argument, which began as a dispute over the volume of the TV.

When the 911 operator asked about any mental health issues, the report says, the family indicated that Korchinski-Paquet had epilepsy and had had seizures earlier in the day.

It says that after police arrived, two officers blocked Korchinski-Paquet from getting to her mother and brother before allowing her back into the apartment so she could use the bathroom.

She then went out onto the 24th-floor balcony and prevented officers from joining her by holding her body against the door.

""Very quickly, Ms. Korchinski-Paquet scaled the balcony railing and the (subject officer) lost sight of her,"" the report reads.

She then tried to scale the balcony and cross onto the adjoining one, which is when she lost her balance and fell to her death, the report reads.

The agency said no officers were on the balcony with Korchinski-Paquet at the time, and there's no evidence the officers committed a crime.

Martino said that the officers seemed to be confused about whether epilepsy was a mental health condition and if they should or could detain Korchinski-Paquet under the Mental Health Act.

""The limited layperson's research I have conducted of the matter suggests that epilepsy is a neurological disorder with manifestations that can be mental as well as physical,"" Martino wrote. ""Be that as it may, I cannot fault the officers for failing to take Ms. Korchinski-Paquet into custody prior to her scaling the balcony railing. She had not given them any indication that she wished to harm herself and was professing to be the victim of an assault at the hands of her brother.""

He also said the officers tried to de-escalate the situation between Korchinski-Paquet's family.

The decision comes after the arm's-length agency interviewed all six officers, along with 15 civilian witnesses.

The agency said investigators also received a written statement from Korchinski-Paquet's father, with whom she had been speaking on the phone moments before her death.

Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked protests in the city and calls to change the way police deal with people experiencing mental health crises.

Martino noted that Korchinski-Paquet died just days after George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, was killed when an officer pressed a knee against his neck for nearly nine minutes, at a time when there was increased scrutiny over the relationship between police and racialized people.

In Toronto, thousands of protesters took to the streets on May 30, three days after the incident in Korchinski-Paquet's apartment. Several smaller marches followed it over the next several weeks.

Two city counsellors then brought forward a motion to defund Toronto police, but it was struck down in favour of introducing body-worn cameras to the force.

The Toronto Police Services Board, the body that oversees the force, then launched a series of town halls to discuss systemic racism in policing, though many protesters said such information-gathering had been done before to little effect.

Toronto police and Korchinski-Paquet’s family were expected to comment on the SIU report at separate news conferences later Wednesday.

Statistician Adam Cotter says the agency wanted to look at harassment that falls below the threshold of criminal behaviour because it has the same roots as sexual violence.

Other speakers tonight include senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, who is leaving the White House at the end of the month, and Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn.

A devout Catholic, Pence and wife Karen are expected to carry the evangelical banner into Day 3 of the convention, touting Trump as the best choice for Americans who consider themselves social conservatives.

Democrats seized on the opportunity, deploying the openly gay Pete Buttigieg, one of Joe Biden's former presidential rivals, in a fundraising missive denouncing Pence's ""divisive, anti-LGBTQ politics"" and ""archaic worldview.""

As head of the White House coronavirus force, Pence is also likely to address an issue that has so far received relatively scant attention from convention speakers: the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Tuesday, economic adviser Larry Kudlow spoke of the crisis in the past tense, even though the pandemic continues to rage across the U.S., while only first lady Melania Trump expressed any empathy for the more than 178,000 Americans killed by the virus to date.

""My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one, and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering,"" she said. ""I know many people are anxious, and some feel helpless. I want you to know you are not alone.""

Kudlow, meanwhile, framed the novel coronavirus as ancient history in the U.S.

""It was awful — health and economic impacts were tragic, hardship and heartbreak were everywhere,"" Kudlow said. ""But presidential leadership came swiftly and effectively, with an extraordinary rescue for health and safety to successfully fight the COVID virus.""

Of the racial unrest roiling the country — fuelled this week by another police shooting of an unarmed Black man, this time in Wisconsin — Melania Trump urged protesters to channel their furious energy into positive change, not wanton destruction. She also resisted the urge to ""divide the country further"" by beating up on Democrats.

But she raised eyebrows by framing her husband, notorious for playing fast and loose with the truth, as an honest and authentic human being.

""Total honesty is what we as citizens deserve from our president,"" she said. ""Whether you like it or not, you always know what he's thinking.""

Trump has been putting the power of the presidency under a brazen partisan spotlight, and did so again Tuesday, pardoning a convicted bank robber who now helps prisoners reintegrate into society and presiding over a naturalization ceremony for five new American citizens. His wife's speech was delivered from the White House Rose Garden.

And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's pre-taped speech from a Jerusalem rooftop, coming in the middle of a diplomatic mission, did not escape the attention of some members of Congress. Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is accusing Pompeo of violating federal law by mixing government business with partisan interests.

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""","INVERMAY, Sask. — People could always tell when Aaron Ogden entered a room.

The 19-year-old had a big presence, said his father, Mark Ogden. He was a prankster, a one-of-a-kind character who would sit and talk to anybody as if he'd known them for years.

article continues below

""He wasn't afraid to make friends,"" Ogden, 50, said in a phone interview. ""This is just the way he was.

""Really easy to talk to.""

People remembered the young man's outgoing personality at his funeral this week. He died in a Calgary hospital last Saturday after collapsing on a run.

His father, a trucker, was able to be by his son's side.

He said a major blood clot had formed around a stent placed in his son's aorta. The stent was necessary after he survived a serious highway accident on his way to work last year.

""It was a miracle, really.""

Ogden said while in hospital before his death, his son told him he was supposed to go for a CT scan in June while still living in Saskatchewan near Yorkton.

It was a routine checkup on the stent, but the appointment was postponed because of restrictions around the COVID-19 pandemic and never rescheduled.

""I didn't think nothing of it at the time, but I mulled it over ... as we watched him decline,"" Ogden said.

""It hit me. He was trying to tell me: 'This shouldn't have happened.'""

The father believes that had his son's scan not been cancelled, doctors might have found the blood clot in time.

Ogden wants all postponed hospital procedures done immediately.

""People's lives are being lost,"" he said. ""These COVID rules are way too far.""

Ogden believes the Saskatchewan Health Authority bears responsibility for his son's death.

""Somebody needs to be held to account.""

The health authority halted hundreds of non-urgent surgeries, procedures and diagnostics in March to brace for the pandemic.

Two months later, when the government felt it had a handle on the spread of the novel coronavirus, it announced the resumption of health services would be staggered.

""Emergency and urgent patients are the priority for services, including diagnostic imaging,"" said Corey Miller, vice-president of provincial programs at the health authority.

""The determination of the priority is based on the evaluation of the referring physician in consultation with the patient.""

Miller said they are reviewing Ogden's case and have reached out to his family.

He said the health authority is working through the backlog of exams that were delayed during the first few months of the pandemic.

More than 1,500 CT appointments which had been booked were postponed, he said.

Ogden questions why something like a CT scan couldn't be performed in Yorkton, where the risk of COVID-19 was low.

As of Friday, health officials reported five active cases in the region, which has only seen 33 infections in total since the pandemic hit Saskatchewan.

Cheryl Camillo, a professor with the University of Regina's Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy, says speaking generally, delaying non-essential services to respond to COVID-19 was the responsible thing to do because the virus was new and spreading quickly.

""The risks are that some people don't get the essential and urgent services because so much of the workforce and the resources of the health system move towards responding to COVID,"" said the health systems researcher.

""It's very human for people to get frustrated because health care is something that is so personal.""

She says another risk of scaling back is that people can lose confidence in a health system some may perceive as having overplanned for the pandemic.

Health officials are in the tough spot of having to prepare for the worst case scenario and what could be a rapid change in case numbers, she says.

During the pandemic Camillo's own grandmother died in a long-term care home in the United States from isolation and depression, she says.

""I suffered an individual loss of my otherwise pretty healthy grandmother, but despite how profoundly sad that makes me, I understand and would defend the care home's decision to lock down.

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""

Loblaw Companies Ltd., which began offering COVID-19 testing for patients at a handful of its Alberta pharmacy locations in June, plans to expand the program to all 234 of its pharmacies in the province by Sept. 1.

The company says it has reached out to all 10 provinces to discuss in-store testing outside Alberta, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford this week acknowledging the possibility.

The swab tests are only for those with no symptoms or any known contact with coronavirus patients and may be useful for teachers returning to school or Canadians who take care of an older family member, said Theresa Firestone, head of health and wellness at Shoppers Drug Mart. Loblaw-owned pharmacy locations include Shoppers stores as well as Independent Foods and No Frills.

""It's very convenient. We're in every community. The other plus is they don't have to line up with people who may have symptoms. We've shared that with Ontario and with other provinces, so at this point we’re looking forward to what they may decide,"" Firestone said.

London Drugs also conducts COVID-19 tests in Alberta. It began offering the service at six locations during the past two weeks and plans to roll it out at nine more by October. Like Shoppers, it bills Alberta Health Services for testing costs.

The service builds on other responses to the pandemic such as online pharmacist consultations and a pilot program where patients consult virtually with doctors in a private room in the store.

London Drugs is among the pharmacy retailers beefing up their role in a health-care system grappling with an aging population.

""With the extended hours of operation, you can basically go in when our stores are open and be able to find a pharmacist to ask a question. So what we’re able to do at that point is basically help triage the system,"" said Chris Chiew, head of pharmacy at the Richmond, B.C.-based retailer.

London Drugs has also hired diabetes educators to test blood sugar levels and assist patients with weight management and diet.

Shoppers has stepped even further into the realm of physicians, opening one of three planned medical clinics with doctors who cater to a roster of patients and walk-in services.

""There are a number of Canadians who don’t have access to a family physician. And we thought there was an opportunity for us to really play a role here in terms of access,"" Firestone said.

Drugstores can also handle the bureaucratic side of health care, freeing up doctors to spend more time with patients, she said.

""Looking for PPE (personal protective equipment), sorting out their waiting rooms so that people are socially distanced, managing virtual care...we’re able to take that burden on for them,"" Firestone said.

In 2018, Shoppers launched its Wellwise store chain to sell assisted-living devices aimed at older Canadians. More recently, it began to offer tips and videos online designed to help ward off depression and anxiety.

Metro Inc. declined to comment on any attempts to provide COVID-19 testing. The bulk of the company's Jean Coutu drugstores are located in Quebec, which unlike some provinces does not allow pharmacists to conduct testing via nose and mouth swabs.

The Canadian Association of Broadcasters issued a report on Wednesday warning of potential closures and widespread job cuts as private TV and radio broadcasters face a cumulative projected revenue shortfall of up to $1.06 billion by the end of 2022.

Most vulnerable are the country's AM radio stations, the report said, as well as other independent private radio and TV operations in smaller markets across the country.

The study, titled ""The Crisis in Canadian Media and the Future of Local Broadcasting,"" was commissioned by the CAB, which represents the majority of private broadcasters in Canada, and conducted through Winnipeg-based independent media economics consultancy Communications Management Inc.

The CAB says it's concerned about the fallout from a substantial erosion in local advertising revenues over recent months.

Radio stations may be hardest hit in the short term, the report suggests, partly due to many advertisers pulling back on their spending in the pandemic and hastening a decline in the media industry's revenues.

Private radio ad revenues are expected to be $383 million below last year, it said.

The report's projections suggest that without further government support those declines could mean as many as 50 private local radio stations go out of business over the next four to six months.

Another 150 radio stations could topple in the 18 months that follow, it said, leading to as many as 2,000 job losses.

TV stations could risk a similar fate with roughly 40 of Canada's 94 private TV broadcasters in danger of closing within one to three years, the research predicts.

The CAB is calling on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to take swift action by establishing a ""more fair and sustainable future"" for local media.

Last month, the organization sent an emergency application to the CRTC requesting permission for broadcasters to be relieved of certain terms of their agreements, such as spending requirements on Canadian programming, for the broadcast year that ends Aug. 31.

Lenore Gibson, chair of the CAB, said broadcasters have ""done their utmost to cut expenses"" in areas such as administration, and ""the last thing that they want to do is cut into programming costs, but that's the only area that's left now.""

The CAB is urging the federal government to provide emergency regulatory relief as well as greater ""targeted support"" for the industry starting this fall.

Without greater financial measures in place, the CAB says the effects could leave many communities with only national and international media organizations to provide them with most of their news, effectively eliminating most community coverage of local politics, health and education in some regions of the country.

Bo Horvat scored twice, and Tyler Toffoli and Elias Pettersson each had a goal and two assists as the Canucks defeated the Golden Knights 5-2 at Rogers Place.

article continues below

The best-of-seven second-round series is tied 1-1. Game 3 goes Thursday.

Forty-eight hours earlier, the Golden Knights, now 8-2 in the post-season, had manhandled the Canucks en route to a 5-0 pounding in Game 1.

""For us as a team we wanted to bounce back from Game 1. We weren't happy with that,"" said Pettersson.

""We played a good game. We should be happy about it but (we need) a short-term memory and be ready for Game 3.""

Goaltender Jacob Markstrom made 38 saves for the win while Robin Lehner stopped 22 shots for Vegas. It's the first time Vegas has allowed more than five goals in a game in the return-to-play tournament.

It was the first game back for Toffoli since the opening game of the qualifying round against the Minnesota Wild on Aug. 2. The NHL is not releasing information on injuries, but Toffoli had been seen in a walking boot.

Toffoli jumped over the boards for his first shift in the first period and scored nine seconds later, taking a cross-crease pass from Pettersson to put the puck into a yawning net. He then made it 2-0 on the power play, delivering a tape-to-tape pass to an incoming Horvat, who blasted it past Lehner.

""It's fun to get back in the lineup and get a big win and tie this series up,"" said Toffoli, who had been acquired at the trade deadline from the Los Angeles Kings. He had put up 10 points in his first 10 games with the Canucks before the regular season ended March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I made some phone calls yesterday, talked to a lot of people. It was a busy day,"" said Toffoli. ""It was good obviously getting the OK from everybody (to play). I got all excited. Felt like I was coming back to my first playoff series.""

Vancouver coach Travis Green said the 5-0 loss was their worst game of the playoffs and that Game 2 was a must-win.

""You go down two (games) against that team early in the series it would be tough and just mentally, too (to come back),"" he said.

""We were better with the puck, played a more direct game. I thought we were better on our feet, quicker. That's a good hockey team. I thought we did a good job of making them defend more than we did the first game.""

Despite being down by two goals in the second period, the Golden Knights looked like they were going to run the Canucks out of the rink again.

Markstrom kept the Canucks alive as Vegas tilted the ice and turned his net into a shooting gallery, blasting away for 22 shots in the period. Vegas got one goal back from Alex Tuch before Pettersson scored on a cross-ice feed from Alex Edler to make it 3-1 heading into the third.

""That really was a back-breaker,"" said Vegas head coach Peter DeBoer. ""You're down 3-1 and you have nothing to show for the work you put in to try and get back in the game.""

Tuch added: ""We knew Vancouver wasn't happy with the way they played last game and we knew they were going to come out flying. And we decided instead of being prepared, (to) be surprised by that for some reason.""

Vancouver iced the game 18 seconds into the third on Horvat's second goal. Then the frustration finally got to Vegas.

First, Max Pacioretty grabbed J.T. Miller by the head and threw him down after the whistle for a roughing penalty. Tuch got a double minor for pummelling Jake Virtanen while the Vancouver forward lay on the ice.

Pacioretty scored late for Vegas and Tanner Pearson added the final Vancouver goal into an empty net.

Horvat had not found the scoresheet since scoring two goals in each of the first two games against the St. Louis Blues in the first round.

Pettersson has been a steady point-getter throughout the playoffs but had been shut down by Vegas in Game 1, limited to no shots on net and one blocked shot.

Markstrom, in his first playoff series, has been the locomotive pulling the Canucks' playoff train. He allowed just nine goals on 121 shots (.926 save percentage) against Minnesota in the first round while registering his first playoff shutout. He saved 29 of 34 against the Blues (.930).

The series is being played at a fan-less Rogers Place. Players are isolating between contests to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This was Williams’ fifth match since professional tennis resumed amid the coronavirus pandemic after a hiatus of nearly six months — and all five have gone three sets. She is 3-2 in that stretch.

The result against No. 13 seed Sakkari, and particularly the way the match ended, was hardly promising for Williams as the U.S. Open’s start approaches next week.

The Western & Southern Open is usually held in Ohio but was moved to the U.S. Open’s site in Flushing Meadows this year to make for a two-event, no-spectator ""bubble"" during the pandemic.

In men's play, Canada's Milos Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Andy Murray. Raonic, from Thornhill, Ont., is the last Canadian remaining in the draw.

Williams was seemingly in control early, serving for the first set at 5-3, 30-0, when things began to unravel. She missed two backhands in a row, then put a forehand into the net to set up a break point, and walked over to the stand holding her towel at the back of the court (the ball people normally handle towels for players, but not during COVID-19).

That’s when chair umpire Aurelie Tourte called a time violation. On the following point, Williams sailed a forehand long to get broken.

At the ensuing changeover, the 23-time Grand Slam champion argued with Tourte, saying: ""I mean, I’m getting my own towels. That’s not fair. You should tell me on the sidelines next time if I need to play faster. Believe me, I will. ... You didn't even give me a warning.""

While Williams eventually did grab that set, she again frittered away a 5-3 lead in the second, plus a 4-1 edge in the tiebreaker. When she sat after the second set, the 38-year-old American tossed her racket over her shoulder the way an office worker might flip a crumpled piece of paper toward a trash can.

Williams came out flat in the third set, as if she’d rather be anywhere else. She double-faulted four times in the second game, including on Sakkari’s eighth break chance, to make it 2-0 and that was pretty much that.

Hours earlier, Novak Djokovic’s neck felt much better, and his tennis looked much better, in a 6-2, 6-4 victory over unseeded American Tennys Sandgren that improved the No. 1-ranked man to 20-0 in 2020.

""Actually, I’m pleasantly surprised with the way I recovered and felt today — just overall, physically, but also with the neck, specifically, because that was a little bit of a concern,"" said Djokovic, who will be eyeing his 18th Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open. ""Going back four, five days, I did struggle quite a lot.""

Djokovic was treated by a trainer and played sluggishly in his opening match Monday, but he was at his best from the outset against Sandgren and saved all four break points he faced.

Djokovic will face 34th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff in the quarterfinals. The other quarterfinal in the top half of the draw will be defending champion Daniil Medvedev against No. 8 seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Reilly Opelka, a 6-foot-11 American who is ranked 39th, delivered 19 aces and knocked off 2019 U.S. Open semifinalist Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 7-6 (4). Opelka next meets No. 4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, whose 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4) win over No. 16 John Isner was interrupted by a rain delay of nearly 1 1/2 hours late in the first set.

Also interrupted by the weather was Raonic's victory over the three-time Grand Slam champion. Raonic, a Wimbledon runner-up in 2016, has held all 29 games he’s served so far in the tournament.

""I have done the work,"" Raonic said. ""I have put in the effort, and I'm just happy that this quickly the pieces are coming together.""

This was Murray's first tournament appearance since November. He missed time due to a pelvic injury and is playing on a metal hip after two operations on that joint.

""Didn’t play well. It was not a good day,"" Murray said. ""The positives are that I got three matches in. Physically, I pulled up OK.""

Women’s quarterfinal matchups set earlier in the day were two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka against Anett Kontaveit, former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka against Ons Jabeur, and 83rd-ranked American qualifier Jessica Pegula against No. 14 Elise Mertens.

He was 5 under after the front nine Tuesday at Ozarks National when he hit driver at the par-4 10th. The ball wound up in such heavy rough that Mickelson couldn't find it, forcing him to take a penalty stroke. He still wound up making a long putt to salvage bogey, and that gave him some momentum for the rest of the round.

""I was able to get right back to even par on the back side with a birdie on the next hole, and then I made a couple more coming in,"" said Mickelson, whose 7-under 64 left him 17 under.

That was good for a four-shot lead over Tim Petrovic and Rod Pampling, who will be his playing partners for the final round. Mike Weir of Bright's Grove, Ont., (69) was nine shots off the lead at 8 under.

""I've been putting really well,"" Mickelson said. ""Today I didn't drive it the way I've been driving it. I kind of a hung a few drives, so I'm going to the range and try to work on that now. But when I come out tomorrow I'll try to be a little bit more aggressive with the driver and see if I can make a few more birdies.""

A few more? He's already made 19 of them in his first 36 holes.

Playing in the final group and with the shadows getting long, Mickelson picked up right where he left off after his opening-round 61. He made birdie at the third and then rattled off three straight beginning at the par-4 fifth, where he nearly chipped in for eagle.

Petrovic tried to make a run at Mickelson, but even one of his career-low rounds only got him so close. His putter went cold down the stretch and a poor approach at the par-4 finishing hole resulted in bogey.

Mickelson added a bridie at the ninth, the only hole he bogeyed on Monday, after a pretty flop shot over the bunker. After the lost ball at the 10th, Mickelson responded by adding two more birdies.

The second of them at the par-3 12th was a backhanded tap-in. His approach shot barely carried onto the front edge of the green, then nestled up to about an inch from the hole.

Mickelson could still squander the lead in the final round Wednesday, when tee times were moved to the early morning because of expected bad weather in the afternoon. But given the quality of his short game through 36 holes, the more pressing question is whether he could break the PGA Tour Champions' 54-hole scoring record of 191 — shared by Bruce Fleisher, Loren Roberts, Bernhard Langer, David Frost and Rocco Mediate.

Mickelson, who decided to make his debut on the over-50 tour to continue his U.S. Open prep after he was eliminated from the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, would need to shoot 65 in his final round Wednesday to move atop the list.

Petrovic and Pampling each shot 64-65 over the first two rounds. Rocco Mediate struggled coming in and was at 12 under.

K.J. Choi was another shot back, and Steve Stricker and David McKenzie were at 10 under.

Moments later, the Chicago White Sox right-hander threw the final pitch in a truly bizarre performance.

article continues below

A no-fan no-no.

With the seats at Guaranteed Rate Field empty, Giolito pitched the first no-hitter of the pandemic-delayed season, striking out 13 in leading the White Sox over the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 Tuesday night.

""2020 has been a very strange year,"" said Giolito, who conducted a postgame interview while wearing a mask. ""Obviously a lot of weird stuff going on with COVID and the state of the world, so may as well throw this in the mix.""

Sounds like he didn't mind that nobody saw it. Well, almost no one.

After right fielder Adam Engel extended on the run to catch Erik Gonzalez’s slicing drive toward the line for the final out, the hollers of Giolito’s teammates in the middle of the diamond echoed around the stadium.

""I’m just stoked for Lucas and so happy and ecstatic and emotional for Lucas,"" Engel said. ""It stinks we couldn’t celebrate the way most no-hitters get celebrated.""

The smallest crowd listed for any no-hitter in the majors over the last 100 years came in 1944, when a mere 1,014 watched Cincinnati’s Clyde Shoun beat the Braves at Crosley Field.

Nowhere close to that number on this night, not with the park that holds over 40,000 closed to fans because of virus protocols.

Suffice to say, years from now when White Sox fans fondly remember Giolito’s gem, there will not be, say, 100,000 or so people claiming they were there to see it in person.

At one point early in the game, some members of grounds crew drifted in sight, but that was about it outside of the teams.

An All-Star last year, the 26-year-old Giolito (3-2) matched his career high for strikeouts set in his previous start against Detroit.

Only a four-pitch walk to Gonzalez leading off the fourth inning got in Giolito’s way of perfection. That was only runner he permitted while throwing 101 pitches

""I’ve been working for this type of game for a while now and it’s really cool that we got it done,"" Giolito said.

Giolito relied on his changeup and fastball to make quick work of the Pirates, who came into the game batting just .229 and have the worst record in the majors. Six of their starters finished the game hitting under .199 this season.

The White Sox rushed toward the mound after the final out in Giolito’s first career no-hitter. Giolito hugged catcher James McCann as the Chicago players joined the party.

The South Side of Chicago normally rattles with fireworks after a home win -- this is the club that gave the game the exploding scoreboard -- but the park remained silent as the dugout emptied.

Giolito, meanwhile, was locked in his own zone in the later innings, fully aware of what was at stake.

""After the seventh, six more outs, looking at who I was facing, became very, very, very possible,"" he said, ""and then we were able to get it done.""

Giolito said his approach never wavered.

""Just staying with the same, like, mental routine for every single pitch. One pitch at a time. Full focus, full execution, straight through the target,"" he said.

Giolito pitched the 19th no-hitter in White Sox history — second most to the Dodgers' 23 — and first since Philip Humber threw a perfect game at Seattle in 2012. This was the seventh time the Pirates have been held hitless, with Washington’s Max Scherzer having done it in 2015.

White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson made a nifty play on a grounder by Bryan Reynolds up the middle in the seventh to preserve the gem, helped by first baseman Jose Abreu’s stretch at the bag.

In the ninth, Gonzalez hit a liner that Engel, a fleet centre fielder for most of his career, caught on the run at knee-high height.

""Yeah man, I think I got it,"" Gonzalez said. ""With that at-bat, I was a little bit mad because I don’t want to be part of history.""

Giolito improved to 30-28 in his big league career. He made his debut with Washington in 2016, then was traded after that season to the White Sox in a package for outfielder Adam Eaton.

Giolito gave up a major league-high 118 earned runs in 2018, his first full season in Chicago.

""I was pretty much bottom of the league in almost every stat,"" Giolito said. ""I kind of had to ... learn from failure to learn my true potential.""

He added: ""I always envisioned that I’d throw a no-hitter in the big leagues.""

Giolito threw the first no-hitter at Guaranteed Rate Field since Minnesota’s Francisco Liriano did it in 2011.

The White Sox, who’ve won eight of their last nine, ended the Pirates’ season-best winning streak at three games.

Giolito was dominant in his previous start, too, fanning 13 against Detroit and allowing just three hits in seven innings. The victory over Pittsburgh was his third career shutout.

Chicago’s first three batters reached in the second and all three came home one at a time after Engel’s groundout and singles Anderson and Eloy Jimenez. McCann added a sacrifice fly in the third off Steven Brault (0-1).

TRAINER’S ROOM

Pirates: RH reliever Keone Kela was available to pitch after leaving Friday’s loss to Milwaukee with forearm tightness. … Infielders Colin Moran (collision) and Kevin Newman (abdomen) also were on the bench after leaving Sunday’s game.

White Sox: McCann stayed in the game after being struck near his left hand by a second-inning pitch from Brault. ... Jimenez appeared to be getting treatment near the mound after the celebration, but manager Rick Renteria said he walked off under his own power.

UP NEXT

LHP Dallas Keuchel (4-2, 2.65) looks for his third straight win Wednesday afternoon against Pirates RHP Trevor Williams (1-4, 3.70).

His team gave up a goal he felt shouldn't have counted three minutes into the opening period and had a subsequent equalizer called back on a razor-thin offside challenge.

Down 1-0 in the series and playing well, Tampa Bay then grabbed its first lead in more than 110 minutes of action midway through the third period only to see Boston tie it up with under four minutes to go in regulation.

""Adversity strikes in the weirdest ways,"" Cooper said. ""You never know when it's going to happen.

""Sometimes you're just dealt ... a sandwich that doesn't taste very good, if you know what I mean.""

And deal with it they did.

Ondrej Palat scored at 4:40 of overtime as the Lightning defeated the Bruins 4-3 to even their second-round playoff series 1-1.

Blake Coleman added two goals in regulation for the Lightning, while Nikita Kucherov had the other. Andrei Vasilevskiy made 22 saves to get the win.

""If there was one message that was going on it was we liked everything that was going on about the game,"" Cooper said. ""I know it sounds so cliche, but we just had to stick with it. Some teams, if you have mental weakness at all, you're probably sitting there saying, 'Poor us.'

""But it's just not been this group. That's not how they operate.""

Brad Marchand buried his second of the night to tie things with under four minutes left in the third period for the Bruins, while Nick Ritchie also scored. David Pastrnak added two assists for Boston, which got 36 stops from Jaroslav Halak.

The teams don't have much time to digest the result, with Game 3 of the best-of-seven matchup set for Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET back inside the fan-less Scotiabank Arena.

Tampa, which beat the Columbus Blue Jackets in quintuple overtime of Game 1 in the opening round before closing out the series in the extra period of Game 5 on a pair of goals from Brayden Point, got the winner after Boston couldn't clear its zone.

Patrick Maroon tried a wraparound that Halak stopped, but Palat was there to bury the rebound to score his first of the post-season and send the Lightning pouring off their bench in celebration.

""It's obviously big-time frustrating any time you lose a game and especially in that fashion,"" Bruins centre Sean Kuraly said. ""We thought we were trending in the right direction, (thinking) momentum may be swinging our way. You get the puck close to the blue line a couple times and you don't get it out, and against a good team that's what happens.

""It ends up in the back of your net.""

Acquired prior to February's trade deadline from the New Jersey Devils, Coleman gave Tampa its first lead of the series at 10:40 of the third after taking a stretch pass from Victor Hedman. The Lightning centre moved in alone on Halak and snuck an off-speed shot through the five-hole after getting slashed by Bruins defenceman Connor Clifton.

Boston, however, responded with 3:58 left in regulation when Marchand finished off a pretty passing play. With the Bruins in the middle of a change — Patrice Bergeron would normally be on the ice — Kuraly took a feed from Pastrnak and quickly found Marchand to bury his sixth and knot things up.

The Bruins, who triumphed 3-2 in Game 1 on the back of Halak's 35-save performance, took a 2-1 lead with 5:27 left in the second on a power play when Pastrnak faked a one-timer before sliding a pass to Marchand at the side of the net.

Tampa responded 56 seconds later after some great work from Point. The diminutive centre twisted and turned in the Bruins zone before finding Kevin Shattenkirk, whose shot was tipped in by Kucherov for his third.

The Lightning dressed seven defencemen with Ryan McDonagh (undisclosed), who has averaged a team-high 26:07 of ice time in the post-season, out injured after leaving midway through the third period of Game 1. Veteran blue-liners Luke Schenn and Braydon Coburn drew in, while Carter Verhaeghe was scratched up front.

Boston owned the best record in the NHL when the league suspended its season because of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, but dropped to the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference after losing all three of its games in the round-robin portion of the restart.

The Bruins found their groove in the first round of the usual 16-team playoff bracket, disposing of the Carolina Hurricanes in five games.

Tampa, meanwhile, had the second-best mark in the East and was fourth overall when the schedule was halted. The Lightning finished second in the round-robin and then downed Columbus.

The Bruins jumped out to a 1-0 lead at 3:14 of Tuesday's first period after Tampa defenceman Zach Bogosian's stick disintegrated at the offensive blue line. Boston broke the other way, with Ritchie stuffing his first past Vasilevskiy, who thought he had the puck covered — much to Cooper's chagrin.

The Lightning responded a couple minutes later when Barclay Goodrow tipped Coburn's point shot up and over Halak. The Bruins, however, correctly challenged for offside after Point was a fraction of a second too slow exiting the Boston zone on the tag up.

Cooper fired a number of expletives at the officials when the call was reversed, but was back smiling on the bench after a surprising burst from an unlikely source eventually knotted the score.

Bogosian, a bruising blue-liner known mostly for his physical play, split two Boston defenders, and as he was getting knocked down fed a diving Coleman, who slid his second past Halak before crashing into the net at 12:42.

""I saw Bogo picking up some speed,"" Coleman said. ""He just kind of had that look in his eye like he was about to do something. I just made it a point to get up into play with him, try to give him an option.

""He made a heck of a play.""

It was also the first sign the Lightning weren't going to be fazed by that early adversity.

""Any time there's a mishap, you just turn the page,"" Cooper said of his roster. ""It was needed tonight, I'll tell you that, because they need to be rewarded for the work they were doing.

""And in the end, they were.""

The All-Star guard scored 35 points and the Los Angeles Clippers rolled past the Dallas Mavericks 154-111 on Tuesday night to take a 3-2 lead in their first-round Western Conference playoff series.

George had shot 29% in the series and endured fans' wrath on social media. He said he spoke to the team psychiatrist before Game 5.

""I mean, whatever it was, the bubble got the best of me,"" George said. ""I was just in a dark place. I really wasn’t here. I checked out. The past couple of games, it was just difficult.""

George said it didn't feel like the playoffs until his teammates decided to create the atmosphere that was lacking inside the NBA's Walt Disney World bubble.

""I came in with that mindset that this is Staples, we’re at home,"" he said. ""The place is packed. I really had to psych myself up. I thought the whole team took that and we ran with it. We created our own energy. We decided to dictate this game.""

Kawhi Leonard scored 32 points and Montrezl Harrell added 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers, who set a franchise record for points in a playoff game. Los Angeles can clinch the series on Thursday.

Dallas' Luka Doncic, who hit a game-winner at the buzzer in Game 4 to cap off a 43-point triple-double, was held to 22 points on 6-for-17 shooting.

Dallas coach Rick Carlisle was ejected in the third quarter of the testy game, which included six technicals and a flagrant-1 foul.

Doncic said Clippers forward Marcus Morris might have stepped on his ankle intentionally early in the third quarter.

""I don’t want to talk to him,"" Doncic said. ""He’s just saying a lot of bad stuff to me all the game. I don’t want to talk to him. I’ve just got to move on. Like I said, everybody’s going to have their own opinion. I just hope it wasn’t intentional. If that was intentional, that’s very bad.""

Mavericks centre Kristaps Porzingis sat out with right knee soreness. It was the second straight game the 7-foot-3 Latvian missed.

Leonard scored 22 points and Paul George scored 18 to help Los Angeles take a 76-52 lead at halftime. The Clippers shot 61% in the first half and led by as many as 27 points.

The Clippers continued the onslaught in the second half, bumping the lead to as many as 45 points.

""Tough game,"" Carlisle said. ""Very poor performance by us. It was disappointing. It was very physical. We just need to have a stronger physical disposition to start the game and throughout. We’ve got to get some more traction at both ends of the floor.""

TIP-INS

Mavericks: Doncic was issued a technical foul in the second quarter. ... G Tim Hardaway Jr. was called for a flagrant-1 after winding up and hitting George in the face on a drive. ... Assistant Stephen Silas took over as coach after Carlisle was ejected.

Clippers: Shot 67% from the field in the first quarter. ... Hardaway and Morris were called for double technicals in the second quarter. C Ivica Zubac was called for a technical in the third.

BIGGER THAN BASKETBALL

Clippers coach Doc Rivers was emotional while discussing the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which has sparked national outrage and some violent protests. Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back while his three children watched.

""That video, if you watch that video — you don’t need to be Black to be outraged,"" Rivers said. ""You need to be American and outraged. How dare the Republicans talk about fear. We’re the ones that need to be scared. We’re the ones having to talk to every Black child. What white father has to give his son a talk about being careful if you get pulled over? It’s just ridiculous. It keeps going. There’s no charges. Breonna Taylor — no charges. Nothing. All we’re asking is you live up to the Constitution. That’s all we’re asking -- for everybody. For everyone.""

CARLISLE'S EJECTION

Carlisle described what led to his ejection. Hardaway had the ball at the free-throw line, and then Rivers was granted a timeout.

""My understanding in that situation is that once a shooter has the ball, a timeout cannot be called by the opposing coach,"" Carlisle said. ""I thought the call was wrong. So I was asking about it and wasn’t getting a great explanation and then it turned into a technical and then another technical. I’m just standing up for my team.""

This document has updated the definition of children to persons under the age of 16 (Section 13. Watch the Kids). In the previous version of the policy, children were described as those under the age of 13.

1. About this policy Top

We know your privacy is important to you. It’s important to us, too. So this Privacy Policy will help you, as a user of the Services, understand what information we may gather about you, how we use it, and how we work to protect it. This Privacy Policy forms part of the Terms of Use that govern your use of the Services. Defined terms not otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in the Terms of Use. In visiting the Websites, downloading the App or otherwise using the Services, you are consenting to the information practices outlined in this Privacy Policy, and to the Terms of Use.

Basically, if you’re using PressReader, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree (but we hope you will), don’t use PressReader, and delete your account.

2. Information covered by this policy Top

This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information. “Personal Information” is personally identifiable information that can be used to contact you or determine your identity. When other information is linked to this personally identifiable information, it may also become Personal Information.

Depending on the privacy laws where you live, Personal Information may include your name, personal email address, phone number, billing information, shipping address, device ID, or account login credentials, such as your login for sites like Facebook, Twitter, Google, or other third party websites or apps (your “Social Logins”).

This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that you provide to us, or Personal Information provided to us on your behalf by a third party, including through a Social Login.

We want to be clear: unless we or a third party tells you otherwise, we won’t ask a third party to hand over your Personal Information in order for us to provide you with the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of those third parties with respect to how they themselves collect or use Personal Information in the course of their own business. Also, this Privacy Policy doesn’t cover any advertisements from third parties you may see while using our Services, nor does it cover content in the Services that links to third party websites. You’ll have to check with them to find their privacy policy.

3. It’s all about you Top

Readers are at the center of every decision we make at PressReader. We collect, use, share and process your Personal Information, we promise it’s not to creep you out, but only to make your PressReader experience even better. By “better” we mean, customized to you – we want to recommend stories and content we think you’ll love, and allow you to save and share the ones you do.

If you want to get technical about it, there are a number of reasons we collect and use your Personal Information. For example, we do so in order to deliver the Services to you as required by the Terms of Use, including providing customer support to you when you need it. We also use it to comply with our contractual obligations to our publishing partners, and to help our product development team build a better PressReader product that better reflects your interests.

4. Some Personal Information is required to access certain features or Services Top

Certain features or Services will only be available to you if you create a Registered Account. When you create a Registered Account, we ask you for basic registration information, including your name and email address or Social Login. This is the minimum information you will need to provide in order to create a Registered Account. You will be required to create a Registered Account to fully use and enjoy the features associated with a Trial, Subscription, Single Issue Purchase, or Gifted Issue.

If you purchase a Subscription or make a Single Issue Purchase, we will also collect billing information such as your credit card number, expiry date, and billing address.

5. We might ask for more Personal Information Top

We may ask you to volunteer additional Personal Information at other times, such as when you provide opinions, post a Submission, enter a contest or promotion, or report a problem with the Services. You can choose not to provide us with this additional Personal Information, but it may mean that you cannot take advantage of the features, Services, contests or promotions associated with our request.

6. We automatically collect certain information Top

When you submit a request for support or information, PressReader will keep a record of that support or information request, and the manner in which it was handled by us.

We also collect information about you as a user so we can make your experience more personal. We automatically receive and record information in our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, your computer or device’s name, the type and version of your web browser, referrer addresses, mobile device IDs, location information derived from GPS or similar features on your mobile device (where you have enabled such features and where you have given us permission to collect this information), date/time stamp, and other generally-accepted log information.

Each website can send its own cookies to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it.

8. When we disclose Personal Information Top

In general, we will not disclose Personal Information to unaffiliated third parties without your express consent. However, there may be circumstances where we may need to disclose Personal Information about you to an unaffiliated third party. For instance:

When PressReader employs other third parties to perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, providing customer service, sending mail, processing credit card payments, processing currency conversions, or other functions necessary to our business;

If publishers of the Publications request additional Personal Information from us. The information practices of those publishers will be governed by their own privacy policies;

If we believe you are harming or interfering with the enjoyment of the Services of other PressReader users, anyone else, or violating the terms of your Subscription, Trial, Sponsored Access or Gifted Issue, or violating the Terms of Use, or if we believe you are infringing any of PressReader or a third party’s legal rights;

If we are required by applicable law (or court order) to provide any of your Personal Information. We will, if permitted by applicable law or the terms of a court order, attempt to notify you via the email address you supplied when creating your Registered Account before we respond to the request;

In the event of a sale of all or most of PressReader’s assets, this information may be transferred to the purchaser so they may continue to provide the Services to you.

9. How we use and disclose Anonymous Information Top

“Anonymous Information” is any information other than Personal Information, including aggregated information that we derive from Personal Information. We make sure that Anonymous Information does not include any Personal Information.

The retailer's second-quarter results easily beat Wall Street's expectations as consumers continue to focus on health and wellness while stuck at home amid the coronavirus pandemic.

""During this pandemic, the importance of health and fitness has accelerated and participation in socially distant, outdoor activities has increased. There has also been a greater shift toward athletic and active lifestyle product with people spending more time working and exercising at home,"" Chairman and CEO Edward Stack said in a statement on Wednesday. ""The majority of our assortment sits squarely at the centre of these trends, and while mindful of the uncertainty in the current environment, we are in a great lane right now.""

While many consumers are concentrating on traditional exercise equipment during quarantine, Dick's merchandise lends itself to various stay-at-home and socially distant activities. The retailer's stores are full of items for boating, golfing and climbing.

For the quarter, Dick's earned $276.8 million, or $3.12 per share. Stripping out one-time costs, the Coraopolis, Pennsylvania-based company earned $3.21 per share. That handily topped the $1.24 per share analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research predicted.

Revenue totalled $2.71 billion, which surpassed Wall Street's estimate of $2.51 billion.

Sales at stores open at least a year, a key gauge of a retailer's health, increased 20.7%. And online sales skyrocketed, nearly tripling in the quarter.

The strong performance — which included its highest quarterly sales and earnings ever — was a bit of a surprise to the market, and investors are rallying around the stock, pushing shares up more than 11% in morning trading.

It was only earlier this month that some analysts were predicting that sporting goods retailers, as well as those that sell athletic clothing and footwear, would likely have a tough go of it this back-to-school season. The argument was that those retailers might struggle, given that many schools weren't planning to reopen for in-person instruction at the start of the school year and some fall sports were not being played.

But adults and children alike are eager to keep busy — and keep moving — while quarantining. Families are now expanding beyond workouts to socially distant activities that everyone can enjoy, like hikes, backyard camp outs and fishing. And this works in Dick's favour.

""As a specialist player Dick’s was a clear destination for many shoppers and benefited from having a better assortment and stock levels than generalists, where inventory frequently ran short,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, explained.

And Dick's is looking to keep the momentum going. For the first three weeks of its third quarter, same-store sales are up 11%."

Loblaw Companies Ltd., which began offering COVID-19 testing for patients at a handful of its Alberta pharmacy locations in June, plans to expand the program to all 234 of its pharmacies in the province by Sept. 1.

article continues below

The company says it has reached out to all 10 provinces to discuss in-store testing outside Alberta, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford this week acknowledging the possibility.

The swab tests are only for those with no symptoms or any known contact with coronavirus patients and may be useful for teachers returning to school or Canadians who take care of an older family member, said Theresa Firestone, head of health and wellness at Shoppers Drug Mart. Loblaw-owned pharmacy locations include Shoppers stores as well as Independent Foods and No Frills.

""It's very convenient. We're in every community. The other plus is they don't have to line up with people who may have symptoms. We've shared that with Ontario and with other provinces, so at this point we’re looking forward to what they may decide,"" Firestone said.

London Drugs also conducts COVID-19 tests in Alberta. It began offering the service at six locations during the past two weeks and plans to roll it out at nine more by October. Like Shoppers, it bills Alberta Health Services for testing costs.

The service builds on other responses to the pandemic such as online pharmacist consultations and a pilot program where patients consult virtually with doctors in a private room in the store.

London Drugs is among the pharmacy retailers beefing up their role in a health-care system grappling with an aging population.

""With the extended hours of operation, you can basically go in when our stores are open and be able to find a pharmacist to ask a question. So what we’re able to do at that point is basically help triage the system,"" said Chris Chiew, head of pharmacy at the Richmond, B.C.-based retailer.

London Drugs has also hired diabetes educators to test blood sugar levels and assist patients with weight management and diet.

Shoppers has stepped even further into the realm of physicians, opening one of three planned medical clinics with doctors who cater to a roster of patients and walk-in services.

""There are a number of Canadians who don’t have access to a family physician. And we thought there was an opportunity for us to really play a role here in terms of access,"" Firestone said.

Drugstores can also handle the bureaucratic side of health care, freeing up doctors to spend more time with patients, she said.

""Looking for PPE (personal protective equipment), sorting out their waiting rooms so that people are socially distanced, managing virtual care...we’re able to take that burden on for them,"" Firestone said.

In 2018, Shoppers launched its Wellwise store chain to sell assisted-living devices aimed at older Canadians. More recently, it began to offer tips and videos online designed to help ward off depression and anxiety.

Metro Inc. declined to comment on any attempts to provide COVID-19 testing. The bulk of the company's Jean Coutu drugstores are located in Quebec, which unlike some provinces does not allow pharmacists to conduct testing via nose and mouth swabs.

The strong advance last month, however, was led by the volatile transportation sector, which spiked 35.6%. Excluding transportation, orders would have risen by a more modest 2.4%.

A closely watched category that serves as a proxy for business investment plans rose a solid 1.9% in July after a 4.3% rebound in June.

While the gains in orders for durable goods is welcome, economists caution that could falter if coronavirus infections surge in the fall, forcing more factory shutdowns and a return to the near economic stall the U.S. went through this past spring.

""The details of the report indicate that businesses remain wary as the initial post-lockdown burst in activity is winding down and the public health situation isn't under control,"" said Lydia Boussour, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.

The big jump in transportation was led by a 21.9% surge in orders for motor vehicles and parts which offset another big decline in demand for commercial aircraft as airlines continue cancelling previous orders in the face of a plunge in air travel linked to the coronavirus.

The 11.2% rise in orders in July left total durable goods orders at a seasonally adjusted $230.7 billion."

The former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England will join the firm as vice-chair and head of ESG and impact fund investing.

Brookfield said Carney, currently the United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance, brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to the role.

Carney has long been an advocate calling for action on climate change, and said in a statement that he sees climate sustainability as ""one of the greatest commercial opportunities of our time.""

In his new role, he will spearhead an increasingly popular form of investing, focused on ESG — environmental, social and governance issues — as well as investments that yield both social and financial ""impacts"" or returns.

""Building on our track record in renewable investing, Mark will help accelerate our efforts to combine better long-term outcomes for society with strong risk-adjusted returns,"" Brookfield chief executive Bruce Flatt said in a statement.

""Mark's insights and perspectives will add tremendous value to our global investing activities for the benefit of our investors.""

Carney, long floated as a potential Liberal party candidate, was reportedly advising the prime minister on the post-pandemic economic recovery.

Former ambassador and New Brunswick premier Frank McKenna, who now chairs Brookfield's board, said that the move to Brookfield fits with a view Carney has long espoused: that the way to make a dramatic impact on climate change is to ""harness"" market forces.

Writing for an International Monetary Fund publication last year, Carney called for an overhaul of the financial system, saying ""sustainable investing must go mainstream.""

""A new, sustainable financial system is under construction. It is funding the initiatives and innovations of the private sector and amplifying the effectiveness of governments’ climate policies,"" Carney wrote.

""Unfortunately, like virtually everything about the response to climate change, this new sustainable financial system is not developing fast enough.""

A report from the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance suggests that more than half of Canadian assets under professional management fall under ""responsible investing,"" and that the assets in Canada managed with at least one ""responsible investing strategy"" grew by 42 per cent to $2.1 trillion at the start of 2018, up from $1.5 trillion at the start of 2016.

Brookfield has approximately US$550 billion of assets under management.

McKenna said Brookfield provides a platform for Carney’s credibility and star power, adding that Carney has the necessary ""wattage"" to attract and retain large amounts of money to Canada from sovereign wealth funds and other international investors.

""I would call this marriage, really, serendipity: We’ve got a highly respected Canadian global leader in Mark Carney, joining forces with a Canadian-based alternative asset manager that is now one of the world's largest,"" McKenna said.

""I really believe that he is in a unique position to help ... enterprises all across the planet to understand how they need to look at social and environmental issues hand-in-hand with return on investment.""

Provisions for credit losses amounted to $143 million, up from $86 million a year ago and $504 million in the prior quarter.

""We were very proactive last quarter and significantly increased our PCLs, primarily to reflect the deterioration in the macroeconomic cost conditions caused by COVID-19,"" bank chief executive Louis Vachon told financial analysts.

""In the third quarter, we continue to prudently build reserves, although at a much lower pace.""

The bank was able to slow down on its provisions for credit losses in part because the quarter saw a drop to 10,000 payment deferral requests, down from 75,000 in the previous quarter.

Meanwhile, the bank's revenue totalled $2.02 billion, down from $2.04 billion and excluding specified items, it earned $1.66 per diluted share, the same as a year ago.

The earnings pushed the bank's stock up by 3.22 per cent or $2.19 to reach $70.24 in early afternoon trading.

Vachon said he was pleased with how the bank has navigated the ongoing crisis and sees reasons to be confident in the country's financial outlook.

""After an extraordinary plunge in the first half of the year, Canadian and Quebec economies have been climbing back with a phased reopening,"" he said.

The bank's economists are forecasting an eight per cent contraction of the GDP in 2020 in the province, followed by a 5.5 per cent recovery in 2021.

""While significant uncertainty remains regarding the duration and the impact of the crisis, there are clear signs that the economy is rebounding,"" he said.

The Canadian Association of Broadcasters issued a report on Wednesday warning of potential closures and widespread job cuts as private TV and radio broadcasters face a cumulative projected revenue shortfall of up to $1.06 billion by the end of 2022.

Most vulnerable are the country's AM radio stations, the report said, as well as other independent private radio and TV operations in smaller markets across the country.

The study, titled ""The Crisis in Canadian Media and the Future of Local Broadcasting,"" was commissioned by the CAB, which represents the majority of private broadcasters in Canada, and conducted through Winnipeg-based independent media economics consultancy Communications Management Inc.

The CAB says it's concerned about the fallout from a substantial erosion in local advertising revenues over recent months.

Radio stations may be hardest hit in the short term, the report suggests, partly due to many advertisers pulling back on their spending in the pandemic and hastening a decline in the media industry's revenues.

Private radio ad revenues are expected to be $383 million below last year, it said.

The report's projections suggest that without further government support those declines could mean as many as 50 private local radio stations go out of business over the next four to six months.

Another 150 radio stations could topple in the 18 months that follow, it said, leading to as many as 2,000 job losses.

The CAB is calling on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to take swift action by establishing a ""more fair and sustainable future"" for local media.

Last month, the organization sent an emergency application to the CRTC requesting permission for broadcasters to be relieved of certain terms of their agreements, such as spending requirements on Canadian programming, for the broadcast year that ends Aug. 31.

Lenore Gibson, chair of the CAB, said broadcasters have ""done their utmost to cut expenses"" in areas such as administration, and ""the last thing that they want to do is cut into programming costs, but that's the only area that's left now.""

The CAB is urging the federal government to provide emergency regulatory relief as well as greater ""targeted support"" for the industry starting this fall.

Without greater financial measures in place, the CAB says the effects could leave many communities with only national and international media organizations to provide them with most of their news, effectively eliminating most community coverage of local politics, health and education in some regions of the country.

Dave McKay, the Toronto bank's chief executive, said Wednesday that all eyes should be on the fall season as Canada continues to plot a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

""While we are seeing early and encouraging signs of an economic rebound from the depths of March, uncertainty remains over the timing and shape of the recovery,"" McKay told financial analysts.

""The real test of the recovery will come once government support programs start to wind down. We anticipate the fall will be a challenging time.""

To help Canadians cope, RBC has approved about 500,000 payment deferrals to customers and put aside $675 million for bad loans in its third quarter, up from $425 million at the same time last year but down from $2.83 billion in the quarter before.

McKay expects most clients will resume making payments as soon as their deferrals expire and said the bank's risk level from the deferrals has been reduced ""significantly"" as many clients saw their deferral programs wrap at the end of July.

His comments came as the bank reported a profit of $3.20 billion or $2.20 per diluted share in its third quarter compared with $3.26 billion or $2.22 per diluted share a year earlier.

Revenue totalled $12.92 billion, up from $11.54 billion in the same quarter last year.

On an adjusted basis, RBC says it earned $2.23 per diluted share in its latest quarter compared with an adjusted profit of $2.26 per diluted share a year ago.

Analysts on average had expected an adjusted profit of $1.81 per share, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.

The result was bolstered by record earnings in RBC capital markets and solid earnings in insurance.

The bank was helped along by Canadians regaining some of the roughly three million jobs lost during the pandemic and credit card holders spending more this July than last year — the first year-over-year positive trend since mid-March.

McKay also noticed strong activity in North American housing markets.

""In Canada, home sales, house prices and housing starts have shown surprising resilience, partly reflecting pent-up demand and low interest rates,"" he said.

""We reported very strong mortgage growth of 10 per cent year-over-year, picking up from similarly robust levels at the start of the year.""

Those promising signs were offset by lower results in the bank's personal and commercial banking, wealth management and investor and treasury services businesses, McKay said.

The bank was also hampered by higher provisions for credit losses and low interest rates, but he insisted that they wouldn't cause RBC to switch up its long-term strategy.

However, he warned, ""While we remain focused on creating the bank of the future, cost management will be an increasing priority as we look to deliver long-term sustainable value.""

McKay's comments and the earnings caused RBC's stock to rise by roughly two per cent, reaching $101.91 in morning trading.

Meanwhile, Barclays analyst John Aiken chalked up the quarter as ""impressive"" in a note he sent to investors.

He told them Barclays was so encouraged by the results that it increased its RBC price target by $2 to $108.

Aiken said, ""While the current quarter’s earnings demonstrate what profitability can be like with more moderate provisions, we believe that RY’s conservatism in building reserves early and its diversified platform (less reliant on lending overall than peers) continues to hold it in good stead.""

Aug. 22: A New York court issues a warrant for the arrest of Huawei Technologies chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.

Dec. 1: Canadian authorities arrest Meng at Vancouver's airport after an extradition request from the Americans. The news becomes public on Dec. 5.

Dec. 6: China demands Canada release Meng and ""immediately correct the mistake"" officials made in arresting her. The Chinese say they were not briefed on the reasons for Meng's arrest. In Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Meng's case is part of an independent legal process with no outside political influence.

Dec. 7: Meng appears in a Vancouver court, where allegations of fraud are laid out. The U.S. alleges Meng misled American banks in a bid to get around American sanctions on Iran.

Dec. 8: Canada's ambassador to China, John McCallum, is summoned to a meeting with China's assistant foreign minister so the country can register complaints about Meng's arrest.

Dec. 9: China summons the American ambassador to China to lodge similar complaints about Meng's case and demand the U.S. rescind the order for her arrest.

Dec. 10: Chinese authorities arrest two Canadian men. Michael Kovrig, who was on leave from Global Affairs Canada, and entrepreneur Michael Spavor. Kovrig's arrest becomes public on Dec. 11. Spavor's becomes public on Dec. 12.

Dec. 11: Meng is released on $10 million bail. U.S. President Donald Trump tells Reuters that he would ""certainly intervene"" in Meng's case ""if I thought it was necessary"" to help forge a trade deal with China.

Dec. 12: China's foreign ministry says it has no information about Kovrig but says the organization he worked with — the International Crisis Group — was not registered in China, making its activities in the country illegal.

Dec. 13: Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, says the arrests of the two Canadians were plainly a response to Meng's arrest. China's foreign ministry says Kovrig and Spavor have been detained on suspicion of ""endangering national security.""

Dec. 14: Canadian officials are granted consular access to Kovrig, and McCallum meets with him in Beijing.

Dec. 16: Canadian diplomats in China are granted consular access to Spavor.

Dec. 20: Indictments unsealed in the United States allege two Chinese citizens targeted companies in Canada and around the world as part of a years-long hacking campaign to steal data.

Dec. 21: Kovrig's employer, the International Crisis Group, says he has not been given access to a lawyer while in custody. A source familiar with the conditions of Kovrig's detention says he is questioned three times a day and kept in a room with the lights on continuously. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland formally demands both men be let go, calling in a statement ""for their immediate release."" Similar statements come out from the United States, Britain and the European Union.

Dec. 24: China's foreign ministry calls out the U.S., Britain and EU, saying the trio should be condemning Canada for Meng's arrest.

2019

Jan. 3: At a news conference, China's prosecutor general Zhang Jun says Kovrig and Spavor ""without a doubt"" violated Chinese law. He says the investigation is also following the rule of law but doesn't provide more details about the allegations.

Jan. 7: The Prime Minister's Office says Trump has affirmed his respect for judicial independence. In a summary of a phone call between Trump and Trudeau, the PMO indicated the leaders discussed the high-profile U.S. extradition request — though Meng was not named — and agreed on the importance of respecting the independence of judges and the rule of law.

Jan. 9: China's envoy in Ottawa suggests Canada and its Western allies are white supremacists for calling for the release of two Canadians imprisoned last month by his country's communist government. Ambassador Lu Shaye makes the accusation in an op-ed in the Hill Times.

Jan. 14: Trudeau says he's very concerned to see China ""acting arbitrarily"" by applying the death penalty to a Canadian convicted of drug trafficking. He says Canada will do all it can to intervene on Robert Lloyd Schellenberg's behalf when a court in Dalian in northeastern Liaoning province announced it had given Schellenberg the death penalty after reconsidering his case.

Jan. 15: China expresses its ""strong dissatisfaction"" with Trudeau over his criticism of Schellenberg's sentence. Trudeau should ""respect the rule of law, respect China's judicial sovereignty, correct mistakes and stop making irresponsible remarks,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying says.

Jan. 16: The U.S. State Department says China's death sentence against Schellenberg is ""politically motivated."" A statement says U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Freeland spoke and ""expressed their concerns about the arbitrary detentions and politically motivated sentencing of Canadian nationals.""

Jan. 17: Ambassador Shaye says Canada's arrest of Meng was an act of ""backstabbing"" by a friend. Lu warns of ""repercussions"" if Canada bars the firm from its new 5G network for security reasons, as have three of its intelligence-sharing allies.

Jan. 18: Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale says the government's decision on whether to ban Huawei from being used in Canada's next generation 5G wireless network will not be influenced by threats of retaliation from China.

Jan. 22: China demands the U.S. drop a request that Canada extradite Meng. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Meng's case was out of the ordinary and Canada's extradition treaty with the U.S. infringed on the ""safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens.""

Jan. 23: Ambassador McCallum says there are strong legal arguments Meng can make to help her avoid extradition to the United States. Speaking to Chinese reporters a day earlier in the Toronto area, McCallum listed several arguments Meng's legal team can make in her defence.

Jan. 24: Trudeau dismisses calls to remove McCallum following his comments to Chinese reporters, saying such a change wouldn't help the two Canadians detained by Chinese authorities get home any sooner. Later, McCallum says he ""misspoke"" when he suggested detained Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou had a strong case to avoid extradition to the United States.

Jan. 25: McCallum tells StarMetro Vancouver it would be ""great for Canada"" if the United States drops its extradition request. ""We have to make sure that if the U.S. does such a deal, it also includes the release of our two people. And the U.S. is highly aware of that,"" he told the Star.

Jan. 26: McCallum resigns as ambassador to China at Trudeau's request.

Jan. 28: The U.S. Department of Justice formally levels criminal charges against Huawei, two subsidiaries and Meng. The charges, contained in two newly unsealed indictments, allege that Huawei misrepresented its ownership of a Hong Kong-based subsidiary to circumvent American sanctions against Iran. Furthermore, they say Huawei stole telecommunications technology, trade secrets and equipment from U.S. cellphone provider T-Mobile USA. Meng is charged with bank fraud, wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit both. In a statement, Huawei denied committing any of the violations cited in the indictment.

Jan. 29: The Canadian government says it has received a formal request for the extradition of Meng, who appears in a Vancouver court to change the people who are providing her with some of the financial sureties for her release.

March 1: The Justice Department gives the formal go-ahead for the extradition case to proceed.

March 3: Meng's defence team announces it has filed a notice of civil claim alleging ""serious violations"" of their client's constitutional rights.

March 4: China accuses the two detained Canadians of acting together to steal state secrets. Trudeau dismissed the allegation made in Chinese state media, saying: ""It is unfortunate that China continues to move forward on these arbitrary detentions.""

March 6: A lawyer for Meng tells a judge the United States bid for extradition raises serious concerns about the political motivations behind the case.

March 14: Huawei pleads not guilty in a New York court to charges accusing it of plotting to violate Iran trade sanctions. Lawyers enter the plea in federal court in Brooklyn, two weeks after Huawei pleaded not guilty to separate federal charges filed in Seattle accusing the company of stealing technology from T-Mobile.

March 22: A judge orders the RCMP to provide copies of the content on seven electronic devices owned by Meng after they were seized when she was arrested. Justice Heather Holmes of the British Columbia Supreme Court says the RCMP must make copies of data on an iPhone, an iPad, a Macbook Air, a Huawei phone, two SIM cards and a flash drive.

March 29: The federal government says it is considering subsidizing farmers hit by China's $2-billion ban on Canadian canola imports.

April 29: Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe says Ottawa needs to treat Chinese imports with the same scrutiny China is showing Canada's canola shipments.

May 1: The federal government changes a payment program for canola farmers to help those affected by China's decision to ban the Canadian product.

May 2: China suspends the export permits of two Canadian pork exporters, including Quebec-based Olymel LP, amid growing tensions between the two countries.

May 8: Meng's defence team tells a judge it plans to argue that she shouldn't be extradited to the United States because she hasn't committed fraud under Canadian laws and her arrest was unlawful.

May 9: Canadian diplomats are joined in a Chinese courtroom by American, British, French and German colleagues to watch an appeal in Schellenberg's case.

May 16: China says it has formally arrested Kovrig and Spavor, bringing them closer to trial on vaguely defined state security charges. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman says they have been arrested for allegedly stealing state secrets. Goodale says the federal government is ""deeply concerned"" about China's decision, adding that no evidence has been produced to indicate any validity to allegations made against them.

May 23: China's ambassador to Canada says the bilateral relationship is at ""rock bottom"" compared to any time since diplomatic ties were first established decades ago. In prepared text for a speech, Lu Shaye says he's saddened Canada-China relations are at what he called a ""freezing point.""

June 5: Lawyers for the RCMP and Canada Border Services Agency deny allegations that their officers searched Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou's phones and electronic devices after a border official wrote down her passwords. A joint response filed in court to Meng's civil lawsuit says a border officer asked Meng for her phone numbers and passwords in case he was required to search the devices for customs or immigration purposes. Meng's civil lawsuit filed in B.C. Supreme Court alleges ""serious violations"" of her constitutional rights and accuses officers of detaining and questioning her for three hours before notifying her of her arrest.

June 13: Freeland rejects the purported view of former prime minister Jean Chretien that the extradition request be cancelled to improve relations with China and win the release of Kovrig and Spavor. Freeland said while she respects Chretien, Canada is either a rule of law country or it is not. Chretien's comments were reported in the Globe and Mail citing anonymous sources.

June 24: Defence lawyers for Meng ask Ottawa to stop the extradition process against their client, saying the request made by the United States was for political purposes, not legitimate law enforcement reasons.

Aug. 20: Court documents released ahead of Meng's extradition hearing suggest a Canadian border official questioned her about her business before the RCMP arrested her. The nearly 1,100 pages of material released by the court were collected by Meng's defence team.

Aug. 21: Meng's lawyers allege Canadian officials acted as ""agents"" of American law enforcement while she was detained at Vancouver's airport for three hours ahead of her arrest. In court documents, they point to handwritten notes by Canadian officers indicating Meng's electronics were collected in anticipation of a request from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States.

Sept. 4. Business consultant Dominic Barton is named as Canada's new ambassador to China.

Sept. 23: The Crown says Canadian officials followed the law when they detained Meng and the defence has no proof to substantiate its ""conspiracy theory"" that she was illegally arrested. The Attorney General of Canada says in court documents that there's no evidence to suggest that the RCMP or the FBI asked border agents to elicit information from Meng during the detainment.

Sept. 24: A lawyer for Meng says there was nothing ""routine"" about the way she was questioned by border officials before she was read her rights and informed of her arrest as Meng's defence team asks the B.C. Supreme Court to compel the release of further documents to support its arguments ahead of her extradition hearing in January.

Oct. 1: A Crown prosecutor tells a judge Canadian border guards mistakenly gave the RCMP passcodes to electronic devices belonging to Meng when she was questioned at the Vancouver airport. The Crown says when the border agency realized it had made a mistake, it told the RCMP the codes could not be used or shared because they'd been obtained during a border examination.

Oct. 29: The federal government says Canada's new ambassador to China has met with Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

Oct. 31: In documents, Meng's lawyers maintain there is an ""air of reality"" to an allegation the RCMP illegally shared details of her electronic devices with the FBI, despite new affidavits from the Mounties denying the claim.

Nov. 5. A Chinese ban on the import of Canadian pork and beef products estimated to have cost farmers almost $100 million is lifted.

Nov. 24: Canada's new foreign affairs minister spends an hour in talks with his Chinese counterpart over the fate of Kovrig and Spavor. Francois-Philippe Champagne spoke with China's Wang Yi a day earlier at a G20 meeting of foreign ministers in Japan.

Nov. 28: Lawyers for Meng say the United States is ""dressing up"" its complaint that she violated sanctions as a case of fraud as they ask the B.C. Supreme Court to decline her extradition. In court documents released, Meng's legal team says the alleged misrepresentation does not amount to fraud and the transactions processed by HSBC were not illegal in Canada.

Dec. 2: Meng says she has experienced feelings of helplessness, torment and struggle since being arrested, but no longer fears the unknown. In a post on the Chinese telecom company's website, Meng says she has passed the time on bail in one of her homes in Vancouver reading books, chatting with colleagues and painting.

Dec. 10: Justice Minister David Lametti says he is troubled that Kovrig and Spavor have been denied access to lawyers as they face trials where convictions are virtually assured. Meanwhile, Meng wins an application in the B.C. Supreme Court for more documents to be disclosed as she alleges there was an abuse of process during her arrest.

2020

Jan. 23: A lawyer for Meng argues the extradition case against her is a test of whether courts will reject foreign charges that run contrary to Canadian values as a hearing wrapped up in the B.C. Supreme Court. The hearing focused on the legal test of double criminality. Crown counsel Robert Frater says the judge does not necessarily need to consider American sanctions law for the allegations to amount to fraud in Canada.

March 13: Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese Embassy in Canada says Kovrig has been allowed to have a telephone conversation with his father, who is very ill. The embassy says in a statement that they allowed the call for humanitarian reasons, and it also says Kovrig and fellow detainee Michael Spavor are being given better food to strengthen their immunity against the novel coronavirus.

May 27: Holmes rules against Meng on the double-criminality argument. The B.C. Supreme Court judge says the allegations against Meng could constitute a crime in Canada.

June 15: Lawyers for Meng accuse authorities in the United States of misleading the B.C. Supreme Court judge presiding over the extradition case. Meng's defence team says it is seeking a stay in the proceedings arguing that U.S. case records are ""grossly inaccurate and based on deliberate and/or reckless misstatements of fact and material omissions, thereby constituting a serious abuse of the extradition process.""

June 19: China charges Kovrig and Spavor with spying. Kovrig was charged in Beijing on suspicion of spying for state secrets and intelligence. Spavor was charged in Dandong city near the North Korean border on suspicion of spying for a foreign entity and illegally providing state secrets.

Aug. 25: Meng loses her battle to have the contents of six confidential documents released to her legal team after arguing in Federal Court that the redacted documents would support the position that their client suffered an abuse of process during her arrest. Justice Catherine Kane says the information contained in the documents is not relevant to the allegations of abuse described by Meng's legal team.

The acclaimed author said he enjoys searching the web for must-see sites of a far-off city, checking out the availability of flights and hotels, and calculating the cost of his travel itinerary.

But when it comes time to book, King would rather see the world from the comfort of his home in Guelph, Ont.

""I can have a little espresso at my desk, and look all this stuff up, and it often feels like I've travelled there,"" King, 77, said in a recent phone interview.

""If I don't travel again, I don't know that I'll miss it.""

This weariness of wanderlust animates King's new novel, ""Indians on Vacation,"" which hit shelves Tuesday.

The story follows Canadian couple Mimi and Bird on a peripatetic mission across Europe to recover a family medicine bundle that a long-lost relative absconded with a century earlier.

As they drift from one destination to the next, the two must navigate their conflicting tourist temperaments.

Mimi, with her trusty guidebook in hand, believes that travel is ""broadening."" Meanwhile, Bird, like the book's author, is skeptical that there's much to be gained by straying too far from home.

""When we travel, a lot of times, the thing we come away with is we've been entertained,"" said King.

""I don't know that we feel any differently towards the people that we see on our travels. We find them interesting, sometimes even exotic. And for a moment, perhaps we have a kind of broadening. But I think by the time people get home, that's tightened up again.""

If anything, travel can show that prejudice knows no borders, said King, who was born in the U.S. and is of Greek and Cherokee descent.

From mountain towns to major cities, King said he's often confronted by racist stereotypes of Indigenous Peoples while abroad, including a photographer in France who asked him to pose with a pool stick as if it were a spear.

""What they want is that inauthentic historical image that Hollywood has made up over the years,"" said King.

""It's always the one kind of Indian they've got because the others don't play well visually. Me in a T-shirt and a pair of walking shorts — God forbid anybody see me in walking shorts — that just doesn't do it.""

In writing ""Indians on Vacation,"" King said he wanted to ""play against type"" by depicting Indigenous characters who are well-off enough to travel the world, while still engaging with the historic inequities that have made such portrayals a rarity in popular culture.

As the COVID-19 pandemic has closed down borders, King won't have to endure airplane food, forced photo-ops or guided walking tours any time soon.

But he still longs for a time when he could plan his dream vacation — then decide not to take it of his own accord.

""I don't need to go to Ireland,"" King said. ""But I don't like the fact that I can't.""

The lengthy report from the Special Investigations Unit notes that Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked ""important conversations"" about the ways in which police interact with Black and Indigenous people, but says there was no evidence of police wrongdoing or ""overt"" racism in the incident itself.

Director Joseph Martino said race may have been a factor in the events leading up to the death of the 29-year-old, who was both Indigenous and Black, but that examining systemic issues in policing is not his role.

""The task before me was a narrow one — namely, to determine whether there were reasonable grounds, on the evidence collected by the SIU, to believe that any one or more of the officers who responded to Ms. Korchinski-Paquet's apartment committed a criminal offence in connection with her death,"" he wrote.

The Special Investigations Unit said six officers were in the 29-year-old woman's Toronto home when she fell from the balcony in May, while her mother and brother were nearby.

The agency's report says Korchinski-Paquet's mother called police to the home because the two siblings were fighting — ""bottles and punches had been thrown"" — and she wanted both of them removed from the apartment.

It says Korchinski-Paquet and her brother also called 911 during the argument, which began as a dispute over the volume of the TV.

When the 911 operator asked about any mental health issues, the report says, the family indicated that Korchinski-Paquet had epilepsy and had had seizures earlier in the day.

It says that after police arrived, two officers blocked Korchinski-Paquet from getting to her mother and brother before allowing her back into the apartment so she could use the bathroom.

She then went out onto the 24th-floor balcony and prevented officers from joining her by holding her body against the door.

""Very quickly, Ms. Korchinski-Paquet scaled the balcony railing and the (subject officer) lost sight of her,"" the report reads.

She then tried to scale the balcony and cross onto the adjoining one, which is when she lost her balance and fell to her death, the report reads.

The agency said no officers were on the balcony with Korchinski-Paquet at the time, and there's no evidence the officers committed a crime.

Martino said that the officers seemed to be confused about whether epilepsy was a mental health condition and if they should or could detain Korchinski-Paquet under the Mental Health Act.

""The limited layperson's research I have conducted of the matter suggests that epilepsy is a neurological disorder with manifestations that can be mental as well as physical,"" Martino wrote. ""Be that as it may, I cannot fault the officers for failing to take Ms. Korchinski-Paquet into custody prior to her scaling the balcony railing. She had not given them any indication that she wished to harm herself and was professing to be the victim of an assault at the hands of her brother.""

He also said the officers tried to de-escalate the situation between Korchinski-Paquet's family.

The decision comes after the arm's-length agency interviewed all six officers, along with 15 civilian witnesses.

The agency said investigators also received a written statement from Korchinski-Paquet's father, with whom she had been speaking on the phone moments before her death.

Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked protests in the city and calls to change the way police deal with people experiencing mental health crises.

Martino noted that Korchinski-Paquet died just days after George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, was killed when an officer pressed a knee against his neck for nearly nine minutes, at a time when there was increased scrutiny over the relationship between police and racialized people.

In Toronto, thousands of protesters took to the streets on May 30, three days after the incident in Korchinski-Paquet's apartment. Several smaller marches followed it over the next several weeks.

Two city counsellors then brought forward a motion to defund Toronto police, but it was struck down in favour of introducing body-worn cameras to the force.

The Toronto Police Services Board, the body that oversees the force, then launched a series of town halls to discuss systemic racism in policing, though many protesters said such information-gathering had been done before to little effect.

Toronto police and Korchinski-Paquet’s family were expected to comment on the SIU report at separate news conferences later Wednesday.

Other speakers tonight include senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, who is leaving the White House at the end of the month, and Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn.

A devout Catholic, Pence and wife Karen are expected to carry the evangelical banner into Day 3 of the convention, touting Trump as the best choice for Americans who consider themselves social conservatives.

Democrats seized on the opportunity, deploying the openly gay Pete Buttigieg, one of Joe Biden's former presidential rivals, in a fundraising missive denouncing Pence's ""divisive, anti-LGBTQ politics"" and ""archaic worldview.""

As head of the White House coronavirus force, Pence is also likely to address an issue that has so far received relatively scant attention from convention speakers: the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Tuesday, economic adviser Larry Kudlow spoke of the crisis in the past tense, even though the pandemic continues to rage across the U.S., while only first lady Melania Trump expressed any empathy for the more than 178,000 Americans killed by the virus to date.

""My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one, and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering,"" she said. ""I know many people are anxious, and some feel helpless. I want you to know you are not alone.""

Kudlow, meanwhile, framed the novel coronavirus as ancient history in the U.S.

""It was awful — health and economic impacts were tragic, hardship and heartbreak were everywhere,"" Kudlow said. ""But presidential leadership came swiftly and effectively, with an extraordinary rescue for health and safety to successfully fight the COVID virus.""

Of the racial unrest roiling the country — fuelled this week by another police shooting of an unarmed Black man, this time in Wisconsin — Melania Trump urged protesters to channel their furious energy into positive change, not wanton destruction. She also resisted the urge to ""divide the country further"" by beating up on Democrats.

But she raised eyebrows by framing her husband, notorious for playing fast and loose with the truth, as an honest and authentic human being.

""Total honesty is what we as citizens deserve from our president,"" she said. ""Whether you like it or not, you always know what he's thinking.""

Trump has been putting the power of the presidency under a brazen partisan spotlight, and did so again Tuesday, pardoning a convicted bank robber who now helps prisoners reintegrate into society and presiding over a naturalization ceremony for five new American citizens. His wife's speech was delivered from the White House Rose Garden.

And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's pre-taped speech from a Jerusalem rooftop, coming in the middle of a diplomatic mission, did not escape the attention of some members of Congress. Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is accusing Pompeo of violating federal law by mixing government business with partisan interests.

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""","INVERMAY, Sask. — People could always tell when Aaron Ogden entered a room.

The 19-year-old had a big presence, said his father, Mark Ogden. He was a prankster, a one-of-a-kind character who would sit and talk to anybody as if he'd known them for years.

article continues below

""He wasn't afraid to make friends,"" Ogden, 50, said in a phone interview. ""This is just the way he was.

""Really easy to talk to.""

People remembered the young man's outgoing personality at his funeral this week. He died in a Calgary hospital last Saturday after collapsing on a run.

His father, a trucker, was able to be by his son's side.

He said a major blood clot had formed around a stent placed in his son's aorta. The stent was necessary after he survived a serious highway accident on his way to work last year.

""It was a miracle, really.""

Ogden said while in hospital before his death, his son told him he was supposed to go for a CT scan in June while still living in Saskatchewan near Yorkton.

It was a routine checkup on the stent, but the appointment was postponed because of restrictions around the COVID-19 pandemic and never rescheduled.

""I didn't think nothing of it at the time, but I mulled it over ... as we watched him decline,"" Ogden said.

""It hit me. He was trying to tell me: 'This shouldn't have happened.'""

The father believes that had his son's scan not been cancelled, doctors might have found the blood clot in time.

Ogden wants all postponed hospital procedures done immediately.

""People's lives are being lost,"" he said. ""These COVID rules are way too far.""

Ogden believes the Saskatchewan Health Authority bears responsibility for his son's death.

""Somebody needs to be held to account.""

The health authority halted hundreds of non-urgent surgeries, procedures and diagnostics in March to brace for the pandemic.

Two months later, when the government felt it had a handle on the spread of the novel coronavirus, it announced the resumption of health services would be staggered.

""Emergency and urgent patients are the priority for services, including diagnostic imaging,"" said Corey Miller, vice-president of provincial programs at the health authority.

""The determination of the priority is based on the evaluation of the referring physician in consultation with the patient.""

Miller said they are reviewing Ogden's case and have reached out to his family.

He said the health authority is working through the backlog of exams that were delayed during the first few months of the pandemic.

More than 1,500 CT appointments which had been booked were postponed, he said.

Ogden questions why something like a CT scan couldn't be performed in Yorkton, where the risk of COVID-19 was low.

As of Friday, health officials reported five active cases in the region, which has only seen 33 infections in total since the pandemic hit Saskatchewan.

Cheryl Camillo, a professor with the University of Regina's Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy, says speaking generally, delaying non-essential services to respond to COVID-19 was the responsible thing to do because the virus was new and spreading quickly.

""The risks are that some people don't get the essential and urgent services because so much of the workforce and the resources of the health system move towards responding to COVID,"" said the health systems researcher.

""It's very human for people to get frustrated because health care is something that is so personal.""

She says another risk of scaling back is that people can lose confidence in a health system some may perceive as having overplanned for the pandemic.

Health officials are in the tough spot of having to prepare for the worst case scenario and what could be a rapid change in case numbers, she says.

During the pandemic Camillo's own grandmother died in a long-term care home in the United States from isolation and depression, she says.

""I suffered an individual loss of my otherwise pretty healthy grandmother, but despite how profoundly sad that makes me, I understand and would defend the care home's decision to lock down.

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""

Bo Horvat scored twice, and Tyler Toffoli and Elias Pettersson each had a goal and two assists as the Canucks defeated the Golden Knights 5-2 at Rogers Place.

The best-of-seven second-round series is tied 1-1. Game 3 goes Thursday.

Forty-eight hours earlier, the Golden Knights, now 8-2 in the post-season, had manhandled the Canucks en route to a 5-0 pounding in Game 1.

""For us as a team we wanted to bounce back from Game 1. We weren't happy with that,"" said Pettersson.

""We played a good game. We should be happy about it but (we need) a short-term memory and be ready for Game 3.""

Goaltender Jacob Markstrom made 38 saves for the win while Robin Lehner stopped 22 shots for Vegas. It's the first time Vegas has allowed more than five goals in a game in the return-to-play tournament.

It was the first game back for Toffoli since the opening game of the qualifying round against the Minnesota Wild on Aug. 2. The NHL is not releasing information on injuries, but Toffoli had been seen in a walking boot.

Toffoli jumped over the boards for his first shift in the first period and scored nine seconds later, taking a cross-crease pass from Pettersson to put the puck into a yawning net. He then made it 2-0 on the power play, delivering a tape-to-tape pass to an incoming Horvat, who blasted it past Lehner.

""It's fun to get back in the lineup and get a big win and tie this series up,"" said Toffoli, who had been acquired at the trade deadline from the Los Angeles Kings. He had put up 10 points in his first 10 games with the Canucks before the regular season ended March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I made some phone calls yesterday, talked to a lot of people. It was a busy day,"" said Toffoli. ""It was good obviously getting the OK from everybody (to play). I got all excited. Felt like I was coming back to my first playoff series.""

Vancouver coach Travis Green said the 5-0 loss was their worst game of the playoffs and that Game 2 was a must-win.

""You go down two (games) against that team early in the series it would be tough and just mentally, too (to come back),"" he said.

""We were better with the puck, played a more direct game. I thought we were better on our feet, quicker. That's a good hockey team. I thought we did a good job of making them defend more than we did the first game.""

Despite being down by two goals in the second period, the Golden Knights looked like they were going to run the Canucks out of the rink again.

Markstrom kept the Canucks alive as Vegas tilted the ice and turned his net into a shooting gallery, blasting away for 22 shots in the period. Vegas got one goal back from Alex Tuch before Pettersson scored on a cross-ice feed from Alex Edler to make it 3-1 heading into the third.

""That really was a back-breaker,"" said Vegas head coach Peter DeBoer. ""You're down 3-1 and you have nothing to show for the work you put in to try and get back in the game.""

Tuch added: ""We knew Vancouver wasn't happy with the way they played last game and we knew they were going to come out flying. And we decided instead of being prepared, (to) be surprised by that for some reason.""

Vancouver iced the game 18 seconds into the third on Horvat's second goal. Then the frustration finally got to Vegas.

First, Max Pacioretty grabbed J.T. Miller by the head and threw him down after the whistle for a roughing penalty. Tuch got a double minor for pummelling Jake Virtanen while the Vancouver forward lay on the ice.

Pacioretty scored late for Vegas and Tanner Pearson added the final Vancouver goal into an empty net.

Horvat had not found the scoresheet since scoring two goals in each of the first two games against the St. Louis Blues in the first round.

Pettersson has been a steady point-getter throughout the playoffs but had been shut down by Vegas in Game 1, limited to no shots on net and one blocked shot.

Markstrom, in his first playoff series, has been the locomotive pulling the Canucks' playoff train. He allowed just nine goals on 121 shots (.926 save percentage) against Minnesota in the first round while registering his first playoff shutout. He saved 29 of 34 against the Blues (.930).

The series is being played at a fan-less Rogers Place. Players are isolating between contests to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This was Williams’ fifth match since professional tennis resumed amid the coronavirus pandemic after a hiatus of nearly six months — and all five have gone three sets. She is 3-2 in that stretch.

The result against No. 13 seed Sakkari, and particularly the way the match ended, was hardly promising for Williams as the U.S. Open’s start approaches next week.

The Western & Southern Open is usually held in Ohio but was moved to the U.S. Open’s site in Flushing Meadows this year to make for a two-event, no-spectator ""bubble"" during the pandemic.

In men's play, Canada's Milos Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Andy Murray. Raonic, from Thornhill, Ont., is the last Canadian remaining in the draw.

Williams was seemingly in control early, serving for the first set at 5-3, 30-0, when things began to unravel. She missed two backhands in a row, then put a forehand into the net to set up a break point, and walked over to the stand holding her towel at the back of the court (the ball people normally handle towels for players, but not during COVID-19).

That’s when chair umpire Aurelie Tourte called a time violation. On the following point, Williams sailed a forehand long to get broken.

At the ensuing changeover, the 23-time Grand Slam champion argued with Tourte, saying: ""I mean, I’m getting my own towels. That’s not fair. You should tell me on the sidelines next time if I need to play faster. Believe me, I will. ... You didn't even give me a warning.""

While Williams eventually did grab that set, she again frittered away a 5-3 lead in the second, plus a 4-1 edge in the tiebreaker. When she sat after the second set, the 38-year-old American tossed her racket over her shoulder the way an office worker might flip a crumpled piece of paper toward a trash can.

Williams came out flat in the third set, as if she’d rather be anywhere else. She double-faulted four times in the second game, including on Sakkari’s eighth break chance, to make it 2-0 and that was pretty much that.

Hours earlier, Novak Djokovic’s neck felt much better, and his tennis looked much better, in a 6-2, 6-4 victory over unseeded American Tennys Sandgren that improved the No. 1-ranked man to 20-0 in 2020.

""Actually, I’m pleasantly surprised with the way I recovered and felt today — just overall, physically, but also with the neck, specifically, because that was a little bit of a concern,"" said Djokovic, who will be eyeing his 18th Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open. ""Going back four, five days, I did struggle quite a lot.""

Djokovic was treated by a trainer and played sluggishly in his opening match Monday, but he was at his best from the outset against Sandgren and saved all four break points he faced.

Djokovic will face 34th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff in the quarterfinals. The other quarterfinal in the top half of the draw will be defending champion Daniil Medvedev against No. 8 seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Reilly Opelka, a 6-foot-11 American who is ranked 39th, delivered 19 aces and knocked off 2019 U.S. Open semifinalist Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 7-6 (4). Opelka next meets No. 4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, whose 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4) win over No. 16 John Isner was interrupted by a rain delay of nearly 1 1/2 hours late in the first set.

Also interrupted by the weather was Raonic's victory over the three-time Grand Slam champion. Raonic, a Wimbledon runner-up in 2016, has held all 29 games he’s served so far in the tournament.

""I have done the work,"" Raonic said. ""I have put in the effort, and I'm just happy that this quickly the pieces are coming together.""

This was Murray's first tournament appearance since November. He missed time due to a pelvic injury and is playing on a metal hip after two operations on that joint.

""Didn’t play well. It was not a good day,"" Murray said. ""The positives are that I got three matches in. Physically, I pulled up OK.""

Women’s quarterfinal matchups set earlier in the day were two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka against Anett Kontaveit, former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka against Ons Jabeur, and 83rd-ranked American qualifier Jessica Pegula against No. 14 Elise Mertens.

""I was able to get right back to even par on the back side with a birdie on the next hole, and then I made a couple more coming in,"" said Mickelson, whose 7-under 64 left him 17 under.

That was good for a four-shot lead over Tim Petrovic and Rod Pampling, who will be his playing partners for the final round. Mike Weir of Bright's Grove, Ont., (69) was nine shots off the lead at 8 under.

""I've been putting really well,"" Mickelson said. ""Today I didn't drive it the way I've been driving it. I kind of a hung a few drives, so I'm going to the range and try to work on that now. But when I come out tomorrow I'll try to be a little bit more aggressive with the driver and see if I can make a few more birdies.""

A few more? He's already made 19 of them in his first 36 holes.

Playing in the final group and with the shadows getting long, Mickelson picked up right where he left off after his opening-round 61. He made birdie at the third and then rattled off three straight beginning at the par-4 fifth, where he nearly chipped in for eagle.

Petrovic tried to make a run at Mickelson, but even one of his career-low rounds only got him so close. His putter went cold down the stretch and a poor approach at the par-4 finishing hole resulted in bogey.

Mickelson added a bridie at the ninth, the only hole he bogeyed on Monday, after a pretty flop shot over the bunker. After the lost ball at the 10th, Mickelson responded by adding two more birdies.

The second of them at the par-3 12th was a backhanded tap-in. His approach shot barely carried onto the front edge of the green, then nestled up to about an inch from the hole.

Mickelson could still squander the lead in the final round Wednesday, when tee times were moved to the early morning because of expected bad weather in the afternoon. But given the quality of his short game through 36 holes, the more pressing question is whether he could break the PGA Tour Champions' 54-hole scoring record of 191 — shared by Bruce Fleisher, Loren Roberts, Bernhard Langer, David Frost and Rocco Mediate.

Mickelson, who decided to make his debut on the over-50 tour to continue his U.S. Open prep after he was eliminated from the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, would need to shoot 65 in his final round Wednesday to move atop the list.

Petrovic and Pampling each shot 64-65 over the first two rounds. Rocco Mediate struggled coming in and was at 12 under.

K.J. Choi was another shot back, and Steve Stricker and David McKenzie were at 10 under.

Moments later, the Chicago White Sox right-hander threw the final pitch in a truly bizarre performance.

article continues below

A no-fan no-no.

With the seats at Guaranteed Rate Field empty, Giolito pitched the first no-hitter of the pandemic-delayed season, striking out 13 in leading the White Sox over the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 Tuesday night.

""2020 has been a very strange year,"" said Giolito, who conducted a postgame interview while wearing a mask. ""Obviously a lot of weird stuff going on with COVID and the state of the world, so may as well throw this in the mix.""

Sounds like he didn't mind that nobody saw it. Well, almost no one.

After right fielder Adam Engel extended on the run to catch Erik Gonzalez’s slicing drive toward the line for the final out, the hollers of Giolito’s teammates in the middle of the diamond echoed around the stadium.

""I’m just stoked for Lucas and so happy and ecstatic and emotional for Lucas,"" Engel said. ""It stinks we couldn’t celebrate the way most no-hitters get celebrated.""

The smallest crowd listed for any no-hitter in the majors over the last 100 years came in 1944, when a mere 1,014 watched Cincinnati’s Clyde Shoun beat the Braves at Crosley Field.

Nowhere close to that number on this night, not with the park that holds over 40,000 closed to fans because of virus protocols.

Suffice to say, years from now when White Sox fans fondly remember Giolito’s gem, there will not be, say, 100,000 or so people claiming they were there to see it in person.

At one point early in the game, some members of grounds crew drifted in sight, but that was about it outside of the teams.

An All-Star last year, the 26-year-old Giolito (3-2) matched his career high for strikeouts set in his previous start against Detroit.

Only a four-pitch walk to Gonzalez leading off the fourth inning got in Giolito’s way of perfection. That was only runner he permitted while throwing 101 pitches

""I’ve been working for this type of game for a while now and it’s really cool that we got it done,"" Giolito said.

Giolito relied on his changeup and fastball to make quick work of the Pirates, who came into the game batting just .229 and have the worst record in the majors. Six of their starters finished the game hitting under .199 this season.

The White Sox rushed toward the mound after the final out in Giolito’s first career no-hitter. Giolito hugged catcher James McCann as the Chicago players joined the party.

The South Side of Chicago normally rattles with fireworks after a home win -- this is the club that gave the game the exploding scoreboard -- but the park remained silent as the dugout emptied.

Giolito, meanwhile, was locked in his own zone in the later innings, fully aware of what was at stake.

""After the seventh, six more outs, looking at who I was facing, became very, very, very possible,"" he said, ""and then we were able to get it done.""

Giolito said his approach never wavered.

""Just staying with the same, like, mental routine for every single pitch. One pitch at a time. Full focus, full execution, straight through the target,"" he said.

Giolito pitched the 19th no-hitter in White Sox history — second most to the Dodgers' 23 — and first since Philip Humber threw a perfect game at Seattle in 2012. This was the seventh time the Pirates have been held hitless, with Washington’s Max Scherzer having done it in 2015.

White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson made a nifty play on a grounder by Bryan Reynolds up the middle in the seventh to preserve the gem, helped by first baseman Jose Abreu’s stretch at the bag.

In the ninth, Gonzalez hit a liner that Engel, a fleet centre fielder for most of his career, caught on the run at knee-high height.

""Yeah man, I think I got it,"" Gonzalez said. ""With that at-bat, I was a little bit mad because I don’t want to be part of history.""

Giolito improved to 30-28 in his big league career. He made his debut with Washington in 2016, then was traded after that season to the White Sox in a package for outfielder Adam Eaton.

Giolito gave up a major league-high 118 earned runs in 2018, his first full season in Chicago.

""I was pretty much bottom of the league in almost every stat,"" Giolito said. ""I kind of had to ... learn from failure to learn my true potential.""

He added: ""I always envisioned that I’d throw a no-hitter in the big leagues.""

Giolito threw the first no-hitter at Guaranteed Rate Field since Minnesota’s Francisco Liriano did it in 2011.

The White Sox, who’ve won eight of their last nine, ended the Pirates’ season-best winning streak at three games.

Giolito was dominant in his previous start, too, fanning 13 against Detroit and allowing just three hits in seven innings. The victory over Pittsburgh was his third career shutout.

Chicago’s first three batters reached in the second and all three came home one at a time after Engel’s groundout and singles Anderson and Eloy Jimenez. McCann added a sacrifice fly in the third off Steven Brault (0-1).

TRAINER’S ROOM

Pirates: RH reliever Keone Kela was available to pitch after leaving Friday’s loss to Milwaukee with forearm tightness. … Infielders Colin Moran (collision) and Kevin Newman (abdomen) also were on the bench after leaving Sunday’s game.

White Sox: McCann stayed in the game after being struck near his left hand by a second-inning pitch from Brault. ... Jimenez appeared to be getting treatment near the mound after the celebration, but manager Rick Renteria said he walked off under his own power.

His team gave up a goal he felt shouldn't have counted three minutes into the opening period and had a subsequent equalizer called back on a razor-thin offside challenge.

article continues below

Down 1-0 in the series and playing well, Tampa Bay then grabbed its first lead in more than 110 minutes of action midway through the third period only to see Boston tie it up with under four minutes to go in regulation.

""Adversity strikes in the weirdest ways,"" Cooper said. ""You never know when it's going to happen.

""Sometimes you're just dealt ... a sandwich that doesn't taste very good, if you know what I mean.""

And deal with it they did.

Ondrej Palat scored at 4:40 of overtime as the Lightning defeated the Bruins 4-3 to even their second-round playoff series 1-1.

Blake Coleman added two goals in regulation for the Lightning, while Nikita Kucherov had the other. Andrei Vasilevskiy made 22 saves to get the win.

""If there was one message that was going on it was we liked everything that was going on about the game,"" Cooper said. ""I know it sounds so cliche, but we just had to stick with it. Some teams, if you have mental weakness at all, you're probably sitting there saying, 'Poor us.'

""But it's just not been this group. That's not how they operate.""

Brad Marchand buried his second of the night to tie things with under four minutes left in the third period for the Bruins, while Nick Ritchie also scored. David Pastrnak added two assists for Boston, which got 36 stops from Jaroslav Halak.

The teams don't have much time to digest the result, with Game 3 of the best-of-seven matchup set for Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET back inside the fan-less Scotiabank Arena.

Tampa, which beat the Columbus Blue Jackets in quintuple overtime of Game 1 in the opening round before closing out the series in the extra period of Game 5 on a pair of goals from Brayden Point, got the winner after Boston couldn't clear its zone.

Patrick Maroon tried a wraparound that Halak stopped, but Palat was there to bury the rebound to score his first of the post-season and send the Lightning pouring off their bench in celebration.

""It's obviously big-time frustrating any time you lose a game and especially in that fashion,"" Bruins centre Sean Kuraly said. ""We thought we were trending in the right direction, (thinking) momentum may be swinging our way. You get the puck close to the blue line a couple times and you don't get it out, and against a good team that's what happens.

""It ends up in the back of your net.""

Acquired prior to February's trade deadline from the New Jersey Devils, Coleman gave Tampa its first lead of the series at 10:40 of the third after taking a stretch pass from Victor Hedman. The Lightning centre moved in alone on Halak and snuck an off-speed shot through the five-hole after getting slashed by Bruins defenceman Connor Clifton.

Boston, however, responded with 3:58 left in regulation when Marchand finished off a pretty passing play. With the Bruins in the middle of a change — Patrice Bergeron would normally be on the ice — Kuraly took a feed from Pastrnak and quickly found Marchand to bury his sixth and knot things up.

The Bruins, who triumphed 3-2 in Game 1 on the back of Halak's 35-save performance, took a 2-1 lead with 5:27 left in the second on a power play when Pastrnak faked a one-timer before sliding a pass to Marchand at the side of the net.

Tampa responded 56 seconds later after some great work from Point. The diminutive centre twisted and turned in the Bruins zone before finding Kevin Shattenkirk, whose shot was tipped in by Kucherov for his third.

The Lightning dressed seven defencemen with Ryan McDonagh (undisclosed), who has averaged a team-high 26:07 of ice time in the post-season, out injured after leaving midway through the third period of Game 1. Veteran blue-liners Luke Schenn and Braydon Coburn drew in, while Carter Verhaeghe was scratched up front.

Boston owned the best record in the NHL when the league suspended its season because of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, but dropped to the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference after losing all three of its games in the round-robin portion of the restart.

The Bruins found their groove in the first round of the usual 16-team playoff bracket, disposing of the Carolina Hurricanes in five games.

Tampa, meanwhile, had the second-best mark in the East and was fourth overall when the schedule was halted. The Lightning finished second in the round-robin and then downed Columbus.

The Bruins jumped out to a 1-0 lead at 3:14 of Tuesday's first period after Tampa defenceman Zach Bogosian's stick disintegrated at the offensive blue line. Boston broke the other way, with Ritchie stuffing his first past Vasilevskiy, who thought he had the puck covered — much to Cooper's chagrin.

The Lightning responded a couple minutes later when Barclay Goodrow tipped Coburn's point shot up and over Halak. The Bruins, however, correctly challenged for offside after Point was a fraction of a second too slow exiting the Boston zone on the tag up.

Cooper fired a number of expletives at the officials when the call was reversed, but was back smiling on the bench after a surprising burst from an unlikely source eventually knotted the score.

Bogosian, a bruising blue-liner known mostly for his physical play, split two Boston defenders, and as he was getting knocked down fed a diving Coleman, who slid his second past Halak before crashing into the net at 12:42.

""I saw Bogo picking up some speed,"" Coleman said. ""He just kind of had that look in his eye like he was about to do something. I just made it a point to get up into play with him, try to give him an option.

""He made a heck of a play.""

It was also the first sign the Lightning weren't going to be fazed by that early adversity.

""Any time there's a mishap, you just turn the page,"" Cooper said of his roster. ""It was needed tonight, I'll tell you that, because they need to be rewarded for the work they were doing.

""And in the end, they were.""

The All-Star guard scored 35 points and the Los Angeles Clippers rolled past the Dallas Mavericks 154-111 on Tuesday night to take a 3-2 lead in their first-round Western Conference playoff series.

George had shot 29% in the series and endured fans' wrath on social media. He said he spoke to the team psychiatrist before Game 5.

""I mean, whatever it was, the bubble got the best of me,"" George said. ""I was just in a dark place. I really wasn’t here. I checked out. The past couple of games, it was just difficult.""

George said it didn't feel like the playoffs until his teammates decided to create the atmosphere that was lacking inside the NBA's Walt Disney World bubble.

""I came in with that mindset that this is Staples, we’re at home,"" he said. ""The place is packed. I really had to psych myself up. I thought the whole team took that and we ran with it. We created our own energy. We decided to dictate this game.""

Kawhi Leonard scored 32 points and Montrezl Harrell added 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers, who set a franchise record for points in a playoff game. Los Angeles can clinch the series on Thursday.

Dallas' Luka Doncic, who hit a game-winner at the buzzer in Game 4 to cap off a 43-point triple-double, was held to 22 points on 6-for-17 shooting.

Dallas coach Rick Carlisle was ejected in the third quarter of the testy game, which included six technicals and a flagrant-1 foul.

Doncic said Clippers forward Marcus Morris might have stepped on his ankle intentionally early in the third quarter.

""I don’t want to talk to him,"" Doncic said. ""He’s just saying a lot of bad stuff to me all the game. I don’t want to talk to him. I’ve just got to move on. Like I said, everybody’s going to have their own opinion. I just hope it wasn’t intentional. If that was intentional, that’s very bad.""

Mavericks centre Kristaps Porzingis sat out with right knee soreness. It was the second straight game the 7-foot-3 Latvian missed.

Leonard scored 22 points and Paul George scored 18 to help Los Angeles take a 76-52 lead at halftime. The Clippers shot 61% in the first half and led by as many as 27 points.

The Clippers continued the onslaught in the second half, bumping the lead to as many as 45 points.

""Tough game,"" Carlisle said. ""Very poor performance by us. It was disappointing. It was very physical. We just need to have a stronger physical disposition to start the game and throughout. We’ve got to get some more traction at both ends of the floor.""

TIP-INS

Mavericks: Doncic was issued a technical foul in the second quarter. ... G Tim Hardaway Jr. was called for a flagrant-1 after winding up and hitting George in the face on a drive. ... Assistant Stephen Silas took over as coach after Carlisle was ejected.

Clippers: Shot 67% from the field in the first quarter. ... Hardaway and Morris were called for double technicals in the second quarter. C Ivica Zubac was called for a technical in the third.

BIGGER THAN BASKETBALL

Clippers coach Doc Rivers was emotional while discussing the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which has sparked national outrage and some violent protests. Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back while his three children watched.

""That video, if you watch that video — you don’t need to be Black to be outraged,"" Rivers said. ""You need to be American and outraged. How dare the Republicans talk about fear. We’re the ones that need to be scared. We’re the ones having to talk to every Black child. What white father has to give his son a talk about being careful if you get pulled over? It’s just ridiculous. It keeps going. There’s no charges. Breonna Taylor — no charges. Nothing. All we’re asking is you live up to the Constitution. That’s all we’re asking -- for everybody. For everyone.""

CARLISLE'S EJECTION

Carlisle described what led to his ejection. Hardaway had the ball at the free-throw line, and then Rivers was granted a timeout.

""My understanding in that situation is that once a shooter has the ball, a timeout cannot be called by the opposing coach,"" Carlisle said. ""I thought the call was wrong. So I was asking about it and wasn’t getting a great explanation and then it turned into a technical and then another technical. I’m just standing up for my team.""

Loblaw Companies Ltd., which began offering COVID-19 testing for patients at a handful of its Alberta pharmacy locations in June, plans to expand the program to all 234 of its pharmacies in the province by Sept. 1.

article continues below

The company says it has reached out to all 10 provinces to discuss in-store testing outside Alberta, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford this week acknowledging the possibility.

The swab tests are only for those with no symptoms or any known contact with coronavirus patients and may be useful for teachers returning to school or Canadians who take care of an older family member, said Theresa Firestone, head of health and wellness at Shoppers Drug Mart. Loblaw-owned pharmacy locations include Shoppers stores as well as Independent Foods and No Frills.

""It's very convenient. We're in every community. The other plus is they don't have to line up with people who may have symptoms. We've shared that with Ontario and with other provinces, so at this point we’re looking forward to what they may decide,"" Firestone said.

London Drugs also conducts COVID-19 tests in Alberta. It began offering the service at six locations during the past two weeks and plans to roll it out at nine more by October. Like Shoppers, it bills Alberta Health Services for testing costs.

The service builds on other responses to the pandemic such as online pharmacist consultations and a pilot program where patients consult virtually with doctors in a private room in the store.

London Drugs is among the pharmacy retailers beefing up their role in a health-care system grappling with an aging population.

""With the extended hours of operation, you can basically go in when our stores are open and be able to find a pharmacist to ask a question. So what we’re able to do at that point is basically help triage the system,"" said Chris Chiew, head of pharmacy at the Richmond, B.C.-based retailer.

London Drugs has also hired diabetes educators to test blood sugar levels and assist patients with weight management and diet.

Shoppers has stepped even further into the realm of physicians, opening one of three planned medical clinics with doctors who cater to a roster of patients and walk-in services.

""There are a number of Canadians who don’t have access to a family physician. And we thought there was an opportunity for us to really play a role here in terms of access,"" Firestone said.

Drugstores can also handle the bureaucratic side of health care, freeing up doctors to spend more time with patients, she said.

""Looking for PPE (personal protective equipment), sorting out their waiting rooms so that people are socially distanced, managing virtual care...we’re able to take that burden on for them,"" Firestone said.

In 2018, Shoppers launched its Wellwise store chain to sell assisted-living devices aimed at older Canadians. More recently, it began to offer tips and videos online designed to help ward off depression and anxiety.

Metro Inc. declined to comment on any attempts to provide COVID-19 testing. The bulk of the company's Jean Coutu drugstores are located in Quebec, which unlike some provinces does not allow pharmacists to conduct testing via nose and mouth swabs.

The Canadian Association of Broadcasters issued a report on Wednesday warning of potential closures and widespread job cuts as private TV and radio broadcasters face a cumulative projected revenue shortfall of up to $1.06 billion by the end of 2022.

Most vulnerable are the country's AM radio stations, the report said, as well as other independent private radio and TV operations in smaller markets across the country.

The study, titled ""The Crisis in Canadian Media and the Future of Local Broadcasting,"" was commissioned by the CAB, which represents the majority of private broadcasters in Canada, and conducted through Winnipeg-based independent media economics consultancy Communications Management Inc.

The CAB says it's concerned about the fallout from a substantial erosion in local advertising revenues over recent months.

Radio stations may be hardest hit in the short term, the report suggests, partly due to many advertisers pulling back on their spending in the pandemic and hastening a decline in the media industry's revenues.

Private radio ad revenues are expected to be $383 million below last year, it said.

The report's projections suggest that without further government support those declines could mean as many as 50 private local radio stations go out of business over the next four to six months.

Another 150 radio stations could topple in the 18 months that follow, it said, leading to as many as 2,000 job losses.

The CAB is calling on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to take swift action by establishing a ""more fair and sustainable future"" for local media.

Last month, the organization sent an emergency application to the CRTC requesting permission for broadcasters to be relieved of certain terms of their agreements, such as spending requirements on Canadian programming, for the broadcast year that ends Aug. 31.

Lenore Gibson, chair of the CAB, said broadcasters have ""done their utmost to cut expenses"" in areas such as administration, and ""the last thing that they want to do is cut into programming costs, but that's the only area that's left now.""

The CAB is urging the federal government to provide emergency regulatory relief as well as greater ""targeted support"" for the industry starting this fall.

Without greater financial measures in place, the CAB says the effects could leave many communities with only national and international media organizations to provide them with most of their news, effectively eliminating most community coverage of local politics, health and education in some regions of the country.

Bo Horvat scored twice, and Tyler Toffoli and Elias Pettersson each had a goal and two assists as the Canucks defeated the Golden Knights 5-2 at Rogers Place.

The best-of-seven second-round series is tied 1-1. Game 3 goes Thursday.

Forty-eight hours earlier, the Golden Knights, now 8-2 in the post-season, had manhandled the Canucks en route to a 5-0 pounding in Game 1.

""For us as a team we wanted to bounce back from Game 1. We weren't happy with that,"" said Pettersson.

""We played a good game. We should be happy about it but (we need) a short-term memory and be ready for Game 3.""

Goaltender Jacob Markstrom made 38 saves for the win while Robin Lehner stopped 22 shots for Vegas. It's the first time Vegas has allowed more than five goals in a game in the return-to-play tournament.

It was the first game back for Toffoli since the opening game of the qualifying round against the Minnesota Wild on Aug. 2. The NHL is not releasing information on injuries, but Toffoli had been seen in a walking boot.

Toffoli jumped over the boards for his first shift in the first period and scored nine seconds later, taking a cross-crease pass from Pettersson to put the puck into a yawning net. He then made it 2-0 on the power play, delivering a tape-to-tape pass to an incoming Horvat, who blasted it past Lehner.

""It's fun to get back in the lineup and get a big win and tie this series up,"" said Toffoli, who had been acquired at the trade deadline from the Los Angeles Kings. He had put up 10 points in his first 10 games with the Canucks before the regular season ended March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I made some phone calls yesterday, talked to a lot of people. It was a busy day,"" said Toffoli. ""It was good obviously getting the OK from everybody (to play). I got all excited. Felt like I was coming back to my first playoff series.""

Vancouver coach Travis Green said the 5-0 loss was their worst game of the playoffs and that Game 2 was a must-win.

""You go down two (games) against that team early in the series it would be tough and just mentally, too (to come back),"" he said.

""We were better with the puck, played a more direct game. I thought we were better on our feet, quicker. That's a good hockey team. I thought we did a good job of making them defend more than we did the first game.""

Despite being down by two goals in the second period, the Golden Knights looked like they were going to run the Canucks out of the rink again.

Markstrom kept the Canucks alive as Vegas tilted the ice and turned his net into a shooting gallery, blasting away for 22 shots in the period. Vegas got one goal back from Alex Tuch before Pettersson scored on a cross-ice feed from Alex Edler to make it 3-1 heading into the third.

""That really was a back-breaker,"" said Vegas head coach Peter DeBoer. ""You're down 3-1 and you have nothing to show for the work you put in to try and get back in the game.""

Tuch added: ""We knew Vancouver wasn't happy with the way they played last game and we knew they were going to come out flying. And we decided instead of being prepared, (to) be surprised by that for some reason.""

Vancouver iced the game 18 seconds into the third on Horvat's second goal. Then the frustration finally got to Vegas.

First, Max Pacioretty grabbed J.T. Miller by the head and threw him down after the whistle for a roughing penalty. Tuch got a double minor for pummelling Jake Virtanen while the Vancouver forward lay on the ice.

Pacioretty scored late for Vegas and Tanner Pearson added the final Vancouver goal into an empty net.

Horvat had not found the scoresheet since scoring two goals in each of the first two games against the St. Louis Blues in the first round.

Pettersson has been a steady point-getter throughout the playoffs but had been shut down by Vegas in Game 1, limited to no shots on net and one blocked shot.

Markstrom, in his first playoff series, has been the locomotive pulling the Canucks' playoff train. He allowed just nine goals on 121 shots (.926 save percentage) against Minnesota in the first round while registering his first playoff shutout. He saved 29 of 34 against the Blues (.930).

The series is being played at a fan-less Rogers Place. Players are isolating between contests to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This was Williams’ fifth match since professional tennis resumed amid the coronavirus pandemic after a hiatus of nearly six months — and all five have gone three sets. She is 3-2 in that stretch.

The result against No. 13 seed Sakkari, and particularly the way the match ended, was hardly promising for Williams as the U.S. Open’s start approaches next week.

The Western & Southern Open is usually held in Ohio but was moved to the U.S. Open’s site in Flushing Meadows this year to make for a two-event, no-spectator ""bubble"" during the pandemic.

In men's play, Canada's Milos Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Andy Murray. Raonic, from Thornhill, Ont., is the last Canadian remaining in the draw.

Williams was seemingly in control early, serving for the first set at 5-3, 30-0, when things began to unravel. She missed two backhands in a row, then put a forehand into the net to set up a break point, and walked over to the stand holding her towel at the back of the court (the ball people normally handle towels for players, but not during COVID-19).

That’s when chair umpire Aurelie Tourte called a time violation. On the following point, Williams sailed a forehand long to get broken.

At the ensuing changeover, the 23-time Grand Slam champion argued with Tourte, saying: ""I mean, I’m getting my own towels. That’s not fair. You should tell me on the sidelines next time if I need to play faster. Believe me, I will. ... You didn't even give me a warning.""

While Williams eventually did grab that set, she again frittered away a 5-3 lead in the second, plus a 4-1 edge in the tiebreaker. When she sat after the second set, the 38-year-old American tossed her racket over her shoulder the way an office worker might flip a crumpled piece of paper toward a trash can.

Williams came out flat in the third set, as if she’d rather be anywhere else. She double-faulted four times in the second game, including on Sakkari’s eighth break chance, to make it 2-0 and that was pretty much that.

Hours earlier, Novak Djokovic’s neck felt much better, and his tennis looked much better, in a 6-2, 6-4 victory over unseeded American Tennys Sandgren that improved the No. 1-ranked man to 20-0 in 2020.

""Actually, I’m pleasantly surprised with the way I recovered and felt today — just overall, physically, but also with the neck, specifically, because that was a little bit of a concern,"" said Djokovic, who will be eyeing his 18th Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open. ""Going back four, five days, I did struggle quite a lot.""

Djokovic was treated by a trainer and played sluggishly in his opening match Monday, but he was at his best from the outset against Sandgren and saved all four break points he faced.

Djokovic will face 34th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff in the quarterfinals. The other quarterfinal in the top half of the draw will be defending champion Daniil Medvedev against No. 8 seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Reilly Opelka, a 6-foot-11 American who is ranked 39th, delivered 19 aces and knocked off 2019 U.S. Open semifinalist Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 7-6 (4). Opelka next meets No. 4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, whose 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4) win over No. 16 John Isner was interrupted by a rain delay of nearly 1 1/2 hours late in the first set.

Also interrupted by the weather was Raonic's victory over the three-time Grand Slam champion. Raonic, a Wimbledon runner-up in 2016, has held all 29 games he’s served so far in the tournament.

""I have done the work,"" Raonic said. ""I have put in the effort, and I'm just happy that this quickly the pieces are coming together.""

This was Murray's first tournament appearance since November. He missed time due to a pelvic injury and is playing on a metal hip after two operations on that joint.

""Didn’t play well. It was not a good day,"" Murray said. ""The positives are that I got three matches in. Physically, I pulled up OK.""

Women’s quarterfinal matchups set earlier in the day were two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka against Anett Kontaveit, former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka against Ons Jabeur, and 83rd-ranked American qualifier Jessica Pegula against No. 14 Elise Mertens.

He was 5 under after the front nine Tuesday at Ozarks National when he hit driver at the par-4 10th. The ball wound up in such heavy rough that Mickelson couldn't find it, forcing him to take a penalty stroke. He still wound up making a long putt to salvage bogey, and that gave him some momentum for the rest of the round.

""I was able to get right back to even par on the back side with a birdie on the next hole, and then I made a couple more coming in,"" said Mickelson, whose 7-under 64 left him 17 under.

That was good for a four-shot lead over Tim Petrovic and Rod Pampling, who will be his playing partners for the final round. Mike Weir of Bright's Grove, Ont., (69) was nine shots off the lead at 8 under.

""I've been putting really well,"" Mickelson said. ""Today I didn't drive it the way I've been driving it. I kind of a hung a few drives, so I'm going to the range and try to work on that now. But when I come out tomorrow I'll try to be a little bit more aggressive with the driver and see if I can make a few more birdies.""

A few more? He's already made 19 of them in his first 36 holes.

Playing in the final group and with the shadows getting long, Mickelson picked up right where he left off after his opening-round 61. He made birdie at the third and then rattled off three straight beginning at the par-4 fifth, where he nearly chipped in for eagle.

Petrovic tried to make a run at Mickelson, but even one of his career-low rounds only got him so close. His putter went cold down the stretch and a poor approach at the par-4 finishing hole resulted in bogey.

Mickelson added a bridie at the ninth, the only hole he bogeyed on Monday, after a pretty flop shot over the bunker. After the lost ball at the 10th, Mickelson responded by adding two more birdies.

The second of them at the par-3 12th was a backhanded tap-in. His approach shot barely carried onto the front edge of the green, then nestled up to about an inch from the hole.

Mickelson could still squander the lead in the final round Wednesday, when tee times were moved to the early morning because of expected bad weather in the afternoon. But given the quality of his short game through 36 holes, the more pressing question is whether he could break the PGA Tour Champions' 54-hole scoring record of 191 — shared by Bruce Fleisher, Loren Roberts, Bernhard Langer, David Frost and Rocco Mediate.

Mickelson, who decided to make his debut on the over-50 tour to continue his U.S. Open prep after he was eliminated from the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, would need to shoot 65 in his final round Wednesday to move atop the list.

Petrovic and Pampling each shot 64-65 over the first two rounds. Rocco Mediate struggled coming in and was at 12 under.

K.J. Choi was another shot back, and Steve Stricker and David McKenzie were at 10 under.

Moments later, the Chicago White Sox right-hander threw the final pitch in a truly bizarre performance.

article continues below

A no-fan no-no.

With the seats at Guaranteed Rate Field empty, Giolito pitched the first no-hitter of the pandemic-delayed season, striking out 13 in leading the White Sox over the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 Tuesday night.

""2020 has been a very strange year,"" said Giolito, who conducted a postgame interview while wearing a mask. ""Obviously a lot of weird stuff going on with COVID and the state of the world, so may as well throw this in the mix.""

Sounds like he didn't mind that nobody saw it. Well, almost no one.

After right fielder Adam Engel extended on the run to catch Erik Gonzalez’s slicing drive toward the line for the final out, the hollers of Giolito’s teammates in the middle of the diamond echoed around the stadium.

""I’m just stoked for Lucas and so happy and ecstatic and emotional for Lucas,"" Engel said. ""It stinks we couldn’t celebrate the way most no-hitters get celebrated.""

The smallest crowd listed for any no-hitter in the majors over the last 100 years came in 1944, when a mere 1,014 watched Cincinnati’s Clyde Shoun beat the Braves at Crosley Field.

Nowhere close to that number on this night, not with the park that holds over 40,000 closed to fans because of virus protocols.

Suffice to say, years from now when White Sox fans fondly remember Giolito’s gem, there will not be, say, 100,000 or so people claiming they were there to see it in person.

At one point early in the game, some members of grounds crew drifted in sight, but that was about it outside of the teams.

An All-Star last year, the 26-year-old Giolito (3-2) matched his career high for strikeouts set in his previous start against Detroit.

Only a four-pitch walk to Gonzalez leading off the fourth inning got in Giolito’s way of perfection. That was only runner he permitted while throwing 101 pitches

""I’ve been working for this type of game for a while now and it’s really cool that we got it done,"" Giolito said.

Giolito relied on his changeup and fastball to make quick work of the Pirates, who came into the game batting just .229 and have the worst record in the majors. Six of their starters finished the game hitting under .199 this season.

The White Sox rushed toward the mound after the final out in Giolito’s first career no-hitter. Giolito hugged catcher James McCann as the Chicago players joined the party.

The South Side of Chicago normally rattles with fireworks after a home win -- this is the club that gave the game the exploding scoreboard -- but the park remained silent as the dugout emptied.

Giolito, meanwhile, was locked in his own zone in the later innings, fully aware of what was at stake.

""After the seventh, six more outs, looking at who I was facing, became very, very, very possible,"" he said, ""and then we were able to get it done.""

Giolito said his approach never wavered.

""Just staying with the same, like, mental routine for every single pitch. One pitch at a time. Full focus, full execution, straight through the target,"" he said.

Giolito pitched the 19th no-hitter in White Sox history — second most to the Dodgers' 23 — and first since Philip Humber threw a perfect game at Seattle in 2012. This was the seventh time the Pirates have been held hitless, with Washington’s Max Scherzer having done it in 2015.

White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson made a nifty play on a grounder by Bryan Reynolds up the middle in the seventh to preserve the gem, helped by first baseman Jose Abreu’s stretch at the bag.

In the ninth, Gonzalez hit a liner that Engel, a fleet centre fielder for most of his career, caught on the run at knee-high height.

""Yeah man, I think I got it,"" Gonzalez said. ""With that at-bat, I was a little bit mad because I don’t want to be part of history.""

Giolito improved to 30-28 in his big league career. He made his debut with Washington in 2016, then was traded after that season to the White Sox in a package for outfielder Adam Eaton.

Giolito gave up a major league-high 118 earned runs in 2018, his first full season in Chicago.

""I was pretty much bottom of the league in almost every stat,"" Giolito said. ""I kind of had to ... learn from failure to learn my true potential.""

He added: ""I always envisioned that I’d throw a no-hitter in the big leagues.""

Giolito threw the first no-hitter at Guaranteed Rate Field since Minnesota’s Francisco Liriano did it in 2011.

The White Sox, who’ve won eight of their last nine, ended the Pirates’ season-best winning streak at three games.

Giolito was dominant in his previous start, too, fanning 13 against Detroit and allowing just three hits in seven innings. The victory over Pittsburgh was his third career shutout.

Chicago’s first three batters reached in the second and all three came home one at a time after Engel’s groundout and singles Anderson and Eloy Jimenez. McCann added a sacrifice fly in the third off Steven Brault (0-1).

TRAINER’S ROOM

Pirates: RH reliever Keone Kela was available to pitch after leaving Friday’s loss to Milwaukee with forearm tightness. … Infielders Colin Moran (collision) and Kevin Newman (abdomen) also were on the bench after leaving Sunday’s game.

White Sox: McCann stayed in the game after being struck near his left hand by a second-inning pitch from Brault. ... Jimenez appeared to be getting treatment near the mound after the celebration, but manager Rick Renteria said he walked off under his own power.

UP NEXT

LHP Dallas Keuchel (4-2, 2.65) looks for his third straight win Wednesday afternoon against Pirates RHP Trevor Williams (1-4, 3.70).

Down 1-0 in the series and playing well, Tampa Bay then grabbed its first lead in more than 110 minutes of action midway through the third period only to see Boston tie it up with under four minutes to go in regulation.

""Adversity strikes in the weirdest ways,"" Cooper said. ""You never know when it's going to happen.

""Sometimes you're just dealt ... a sandwich that doesn't taste very good, if you know what I mean.""

""But it's just not been this group. That's not how they operate.""

Brad Marchand buried his second of the night to tie things with under four minutes left in the third period for the Bruins, while Nick Ritchie also scored. David Pastrnak added two assists for Boston, which got 36 stops from Jaroslav Halak.

The teams don't have much time to digest the result, with Game 3 of the best-of-seven matchup set for Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET back inside the fan-less Scotiabank Arena.

Tampa, which beat the Columbus Blue Jackets in quintuple overtime of Game 1 in the opening round before closing out the series in the extra period of Game 5 on a pair of goals from Brayden Point, got the winner after Boston couldn't clear its zone.

Patrick Maroon tried a wraparound that Halak stopped, but Palat was there to bury the rebound to score his first of the post-season and send the Lightning pouring off their bench in celebration.

""It's obviously big-time frustrating any time you lose a game and especially in that fashion,"" Bruins centre Sean Kuraly said. ""We thought we were trending in the right direction, (thinking) momentum may be swinging our way. You get the puck close to the blue line a couple times and you don't get it out, and against a good team that's what happens.

""It ends up in the back of your net.""

Acquired prior to February's trade deadline from the New Jersey Devils, Coleman gave Tampa its first lead of the series at 10:40 of the third after taking a stretch pass from Victor Hedman. The Lightning centre moved in alone on Halak and snuck an off-speed shot through the five-hole after getting slashed by Bruins defenceman Connor Clifton.

Boston, however, responded with 3:58 left in regulation when Marchand finished off a pretty passing play. With the Bruins in the middle of a change — Patrice Bergeron would normally be on the ice — Kuraly took a feed from Pastrnak and quickly found Marchand to bury his sixth and knot things up.

The Bruins, who triumphed 3-2 in Game 1 on the back of Halak's 35-save performance, took a 2-1 lead with 5:27 left in the second on a power play when Pastrnak faked a one-timer before sliding a pass to Marchand at the side of the net.

Tampa responded 56 seconds later after some great work from Point. The diminutive centre twisted and turned in the Bruins zone before finding Kevin Shattenkirk, whose shot was tipped in by Kucherov for his third.

The Lightning dressed seven defencemen with Ryan McDonagh (undisclosed), who has averaged a team-high 26:07 of ice time in the post-season, out injured after leaving midway through the third period of Game 1. Veteran blue-liners Luke Schenn and Braydon Coburn drew in, while Carter Verhaeghe was scratched up front.

Boston owned the best record in the NHL when the league suspended its season because of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, but dropped to the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference after losing all three of its games in the round-robin portion of the restart.

The Bruins found their groove in the first round of the usual 16-team playoff bracket, disposing of the Carolina Hurricanes in five games.

Tampa, meanwhile, had the second-best mark in the East and was fourth overall when the schedule was halted. The Lightning finished second in the round-robin and then downed Columbus.

The Bruins jumped out to a 1-0 lead at 3:14 of Tuesday's first period after Tampa defenceman Zach Bogosian's stick disintegrated at the offensive blue line. Boston broke the other way, with Ritchie stuffing his first past Vasilevskiy, who thought he had the puck covered — much to Cooper's chagrin.

The Lightning responded a couple minutes later when Barclay Goodrow tipped Coburn's point shot up and over Halak. The Bruins, however, correctly challenged for offside after Point was a fraction of a second too slow exiting the Boston zone on the tag up.

Cooper fired a number of expletives at the officials when the call was reversed, but was back smiling on the bench after a surprising burst from an unlikely source eventually knotted the score.

Bogosian, a bruising blue-liner known mostly for his physical play, split two Boston defenders, and as he was getting knocked down fed a diving Coleman, who slid his second past Halak before crashing into the net at 12:42.

""I saw Bogo picking up some speed,"" Coleman said. ""He just kind of had that look in his eye like he was about to do something. I just made it a point to get up into play with him, try to give him an option.

""He made a heck of a play.""

It was also the first sign the Lightning weren't going to be fazed by that early adversity.

""Any time there's a mishap, you just turn the page,"" Cooper said of his roster. ""It was needed tonight, I'll tell you that, because they need to be rewarded for the work they were doing.

""And in the end, they were.""

The judges scored it 30-26, 30-27 and 29-28 for Romero. But White pointed out that the 23-year-old from Welland, Ont., failed to finish his damaged opponent and had trouble when Breeden switched to southpaw.

""He's 23 years old, he's a young kid. I absolutely positively think he's going to be in the UFC some day. Just not tonight,"" said White.

Romero (8-0-0) was the busier fighter in the first round. He took Breeden down twice in the second round and punished the American with leg kicks.

The 31-year-old Breeden (8-3-0) got Romero's attention late in the round with a knee to the head but was limping as he went back to his corner.

Breeden's leg buckled repeatedly in the third as Romero kept lashing him with kicks. But despite the damage from 25 kicks in total, Breeden kept coming forward and swinging.

""Those calf kicks were nasty,"" said Romero. ""My legs are actually hurting from them so you know they're pretty hard.""

""He's super-tough ... He has a lot of heart,"" he said of Breeden.

Vancouver-based drag artist and contestant Ilona Verley tweeted this week that she ""ended up in the hospital with a suicide attempt"" from all the hate she was getting after a recent episode aired.

She said she's sick of letting people get away with bullying, and vowed to defend fellow queen and contestant Rita Baga against the vitriol she's also getting online.

In an emailed statement to The Canadian Press, Crave said it hopes fans will respect the show's message of ""inclusivity and acceptance.""

""'Canada's Drag Race' has an international fan base, and it's unfortunate that some of those fans have let their passion cross the boundary into harassment by posting hateful comments about our queens and judges online,"" said the Bell Media streamer, which debuted the show last month.

Me in a T-shirt and a pair of walking shorts — God forbid anybody see me in walking shorts — that just doesn't do it.""","Thomas King says he takes pleasure in planning vacations. He just doesn't like going on them.

The acclaimed author said he enjoys searching the web for must-see sites of a far-off city, checking out the availability of flights and hotels, and calculating the cost of his travel itinerary.

article continues below

But when it comes time to book, King would rather see the world from the comfort of his home in Guelph, Ont.

""I can have a little espresso at my desk, and look all this stuff up, and it often feels like I've travelled there,"" King, 77, said in a recent phone interview.

""If I don't travel again, I don't know that I'll miss it.""

This weariness of wanderlust animates King's new novel, ""Indians on Vacation,"" which hit shelves Tuesday.

The story follows Canadian couple Mimi and Bird on a peripatetic mission across Europe to recover a family medicine bundle that a long-lost relative absconded with a century earlier.

As they drift from one destination to the next, the two must navigate their conflicting tourist temperaments.

Mimi, with her trusty guidebook in hand, believes that travel is ""broadening."" Meanwhile, Bird, like the book's author, is skeptical that there's much to be gained by straying too far from home.

""When we travel, a lot of times, the thing we come away with is we've been entertained,"" said King.

""I don't know that we feel any differently towards the people that we see on our travels. We find them interesting, sometimes even exotic. And for a moment, perhaps we have a kind of broadening. But I think by the time people get home, that's tightened up again.""

If anything, travel can show that prejudice knows no borders, said King, who was born in the U.S. and is of Greek and Cherokee descent.

From mountain towns to major cities, King said he's often confronted by racist stereotypes of Indigenous Peoples while abroad, including a photographer in France who asked him to pose with a pool stick as if it were a spear.

""What they want is that inauthentic historical image that Hollywood has made up over the years,"" said King.

""It's always the one kind of Indian they've got because the others don't play well visually. Me in a T-shirt and a pair of walking shorts — God forbid anybody see me in walking shorts — that just doesn't do it.""

In writing ""Indians on Vacation,"" King said he wanted to ""play against type"" by depicting Indigenous characters who are well-off enough to travel the world, while still engaging with the historic inequities that have made such portrayals a rarity in popular culture.

As the COVID-19 pandemic has closed down borders, King won't have to endure airplane food, forced photo-ops or guided walking tours any time soon.

But he still longs for a time when he could plan his dream vacation — then decide not to take it of his own accord.

""I don't need to go to Ireland,"" King said. ""But I don't like the fact that I can't.""

Now at 19, Cravalho is checking off another milestone: Her first live-action film, ""All Together Now,"" is being released on Netflix Friday. And once again, she’s in the lead.

Based on Matthew Quick’s novel ""Sorta Like a Rock Star,"" the film from director Brett Haley finds Cravalho playing a very different kind of character from the adventurous Polynesian princess. Amber is a high school student with a to-die-for voice, an unflappable optimism and a dream of going to Carnegie Mellon. She also happens to be living in a school bus with her alcoholic mother.

""This felt like the next step,"" she said. ""I’m a little older and I love the challenge of showing these tougher emotions and telling these deeper stories.""

She’d actually auditioned for Hayley before. She didn’t get that part, but he promised he’d remember her.

""I was like, sure, OK, I’m never going to hear from this guy again,"" she laughed. And then Amber Appleton came along.

""I really related to Amber. I genuinely I understood her optimism,"" she said. ""I am an optimist almost to a fault myself. I also have to kind of get real and be like, ‘Oh, wait, I can reach out and ask for help.’""

Cravalho had already had some on-camera experience, including in the short-lived television show ""Rise,"" which was cancelled after one season. (""My first heartbreak."") But she was nervous about a feature film and acting opposite people like Carol Burnett.

""My biggest challenge is figuring out what to do with my face on screen,"" she said.

Thankfully, she had an unusually empathetic and supportive director in Haley, who helped her feel comfortable and gave her space to play around with her character and lines. And he’s excited for audiences to see her in a more dramatic role.

""Yes, she’s optimistic. Yes, she’s bright and shiny. But she also has a depth of emotion. She really is layered. She’s not just this Disney princess,"" Haley said. ""I think you can see that in her performance. She goes to so many different places in the role.""

Cravalho has for the past few years been living outside of Hawaii, first in New York and now in Los Angeles. She finished up high school on her laptop from the set of ""Rise,"" and she empathizes with all the students having to do that now.

For now, she’ll continue pursing acting and already has another series in the works in Amazon’s thriller ""The Power,"" but she’d also like to go to college and keep her options open. She’s only 19, after all.

""I’m not really sure where my career will take me. I’ve been lucky to play strong women characters so I hope I’ll continue on that path,"" she said. ""But I’m also young and figuring out what fuels me as a person and figuring out that my career (can be) different from who I am.""

Tommy Oliver's ""40 Years A Prisoner"" is ""the story of nine people from Philadelphia-based back-to-nature group, MOVE, who were convicted of murdering a police officer they likely didn't kill.""

And ""The Way I See It"" by Dawn Porter looks as former U.S. Presidents Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan through the eyes of renowned photojournalist Pete Souza.

""Planet Africa stands as one of the proudest moments in my career,"" Bailey said Tuesday in a news release.

""Twenty-five years ago, I joined with colleagues and friends to launch a festival platform for films from all over the African diaspora. We brought filmmaking legends together with new talent. We hosted a Planet Africa party that got both Hollywood stars and everyday Black people on the dance floor. We made our dreams for Black creativity real. I hope celebrating that work now can help inspire the next generation.""

Other new films added to the festival include the Canadian documentary ""Underplayed"" by Stacey Lee.

The story of gender inequality in the electronic music scene will screen at OLG Play Stage at Ontario Place on Sept. 19, followed by a live performance with DJ/producer REZZ, who is in the film.

The Special Events lineup also includes ""The Water Man,"" a mystical family-friendly adventure directed by acclaimed actor David Oyelowo.

Family fare is also found in the animated film ""Wolfwalkers"" by Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart, about a girl who discovers a surprising world while hunting wolves in Ireland.

Matthew Heineman's documentary ""The Boy from Medellin"" profiles Colombian reggaeton musician J Balvin, who will be featured in a talk at the festival.

For ""The Truffle Hunters"" documentary by Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw, a special curated menu from restaurant company Oliver & Bonacini will be available for purchase.

TIFF has also added more ""In Conversation With…"" virtual star chats. Participants include: filmmakers Claire Denis and Barry Jenkins; filmmaker Ava DuVernay; actress Saoirse Ronan; Montreal filmmaker Barry Levinson and actor Denzel Washington; and DJ D-Nice with music-video director Anthony Mandler.

Other announcements made Tuesday include the lineup of 36 short films and details on TIFF's annual awards, which will be handed out on Sept. 20.

This year the coveted People's Choice prize will be chosen through online votes.

There will also be three jury-selected IMDbPro Short Cuts Awards — for best film, best Canadian film, and the Share Her Journey Award for best film by a woman. Winners will each get a bursary of $10,000 and a one-year membership to IMDbPro.

And the Amplify Voices Awards presented by Canada Goose will be presented to the three best feature films by under-represented filmmakers. All feature films in TIFF's official selection by self-identified BIPOC and Canadian filmmakers are eligible, and the three winners will receive $10,000 each.

TIFF has also announced that the previously announced in-person screening venue Isabel Bader Theatre is no longer available. The venue is on the University of Toronto campus and can no longer be used ""due to ever-evolving health precautions necessary for the back-to-school season in September.""

But on the weekend of August 25, 2000 the $10 million pic about the Rancho Carne Toros and the East Compton Clovers skyrocketed to No. 1 and stayed there for two weeks.

""Bring It On"" has been defying expectations since the beginning, when it was still called ""Cheer Fever"" and getting first-time screenwriter Jessica Bendinger nothing but ""no’s"" from the studios (27 in total).

Not only was it a hit of its time (that spawned five direct-to-video sequels) but 20 years later is just as relevant as ever for its prescient themes and young fans from Ariana Grande to Jerry Harris of the Netflix phenomenon ""Cheer.""

The Associated Press spoke to Bendinger and director Peyton Reed about making ""Bring It On."" Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.

___

AP: What was the story behind changing the title from ""Cheer Fever"" to ""Bring It On""?

REED: There was a studio attitude that the word ""cheer"" was going to narrow the audience too much and that people might just think it’s a cheerleading movie. And I’m thinking, ""Well it IS a cheerleading movie."" But they came up with lists to encapsulate the attitude of the movie.

BENDINGER: I think it was a big wrestling call out back in the day, like ""bring it on."" I thought it was kind of funny.

REED: I liked the confrontational aspect of it. But there is that scene with Gabrielle when she says to ""bring it"" in the final. I remember having to wrap my overly logical head around ""Wait, she says ‘bring it’ she doesn’t say ‘bring it on.’""

AP: Did the $10 million budget feel like a lot, or enough?

REED: It never seems like a lot but it also felt like, that’s cool, this is going to be a scrappy movie. We were all so enthusiastic about making it. We knew in relation to other movies at Universal that we were small potatoes but that gave us a certain amount of freedom. We were off their radar a little bit.

BENDINGER: I remember going down to Oceanside, California, to film the nationals and thinking wow, this is actually pretty impressive.

REED: We made Oceanside look like Florida except the ocean was on the wrong side.

AP: Did the script change much from when you started pitching in 1996?

BENDINGER: I’ve been revisiting my youthful indiscretions in writing form because I’m publishing the screenplay for the first time with some never-before-seen scenes. I had like six endings. But Peyton saw the David in the marble.

REED: That first draft would have been a sprawling, three-hour cheerleading epic.

AP: Is anything you wish you could change?

BENDINGER: We did try to put nuance in it that whole thing with Jan and Courtney and the ""digits that slip"" occasionally. It was a very ambitious way to talk about slut-shaming, in my mind. When I see that now, it’s awkward for me and uncomfortable. In a teen comedy, it’s just not reading that way even if it was our intention.

REED: I think any time you try to push boundaries, there are things that age well and things that don’t.

AP: Why do you think ""Bring It On"" gets referred to as a cult classic when it made so much money ($90.5 million) at the time?

REED: Jessica has theory that made sense to me. And it was basically like a high percentage of guys who talk to us about the movie come up and say, ""Listen, I know it wasn’t targeted at me but..."". They qualify their positive feelings. Maybe it’s a cult movie because guys are embarrassed to admit they like it.

BENDINGER: And we made it for everybody! I think that there’s some internalized surprise or shame for guys like they can’t believe they like this movie that so clearly seems like it made for young women. But, and this is a little saltier, I feel like saying ""oh really, I was writing young teenage girls in cheerleading outfits and you really thought that wouldn’t be for you?""

AP: Did you read reviews when they came out?

REED: I have to admit, I was pretty obsessive.

BENDINGER: I remember refreshing to see if The New York Times online had posted. The A.O. Scott review came up at some point and I burst into tears that he got it.

AP: Roger Ebert basically used his to rail against the MPAA and the PG-13 teen comedy.

BENDINGER: There’s a story there. I’m from Chicago and Roger Ebert was a neighbour of my dad’s and he would see him at the grocery store. Apparently after that review, my dad confronted Roger in the Carnival Grocery like, ""Hey, I’m Jessica’s dad and I really don’t like what you wrote."" People like to quote the Citizen Kane line but my dad was (mad).

REED: The Citizen Kane line came later! Ebert wrote the review and reassessed it. Maybe your dad got through to him.

AP: Is there anything you’re particularly proud of?

REED: The whole notion of cultural appropriation. If you sort of look at it through today’s lens, Kirsten’s character is really confronting her own white privilege. It’s one of the great strengths of Jessica’s script.

Opening in theatres and through on-demand platforms on Friday, the third instalment comes 10 years after its inception and several months into a pandemic that disrupted its debut date multiple times, as the team navigated cinema restrictions and other film releases.

""Cue confetti,"" Toronto-raised Reeves said in a video conferencing interview with The Canadian Press, throwing his hands up in mock celebration of the film finally coming out.

""It's really exciting, and obviously it's being released in very challenging, extraordinary times. But we're grateful that it is able to be released and people are able to see it. We're proud of the film.""

Dean Parisot directed the screenplay by Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon, who both also wrote 1989's ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" and 1991's ""Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey.""

Now middle-aged and married with kids, Wyld Stallyns rockers Bill (Winter) and Ted (Reeves) once again travel to the past and future, this time on a mission to save the universe with a song. Along the way, the sweet-natured slackers meet historical figures and various versions of themselves.

Brigette Lundy-Paine and Samara Weaving play the duo's daughters who also travel through time to help their dads create an epic tune that will unite the world and prevent catastrophe.

Other cast members include Jayma Mays and Erinn Hayes as Bill and Ted's wives, and Win Butler of Montreal-based indie rock band Arcade Fire as a member of the Great Leaders, who are led by Holland Taylor's character.

Winter said the past few months were ""really stressful"" trying to figure out how to get the film to audiences.

""It was not easy. I'm not going to sit here and be cavalier. From March until now has been a ride,"" he said.

""We never could have anticipated such an incredibly challenging period for the entire planet, and we had been very much wanting to get the film out on schedule or as close to schedule as possible. The fans have been waiting for it for a really long time.""

Everyone involved ""put a lot of effort to get the film out now, and to get it out safely so people had options for how they would see it,"" he added.

""I feel very appreciative that they've made the film available VOD, which we felt very strongly about,"" Winter said.

""But they also didn't completely turn their back on exhibition, and that's really important — that exhibition has the support from distribution and production. They shouldn't be left to just die during this pandemic.""

For all its delays, the new chapter seems somewhat timely, with a story about a need to save humanity mirroring a longing to save the world from COVID-19.

""We believed in the idea from the moment it was first pitched to us,"" said Winter.

""We've all been friends a very long time and ... Keanu and I both found this very rich with potential. It made us laugh.""

The two said they've remained devoted to the project and the franchise for so long because the characters have been like totally excellent dudes by their sides all these years.

""Certainly in terms of comedy it's been pivotal,"" said Reeves, who is filming ""Matrix 4"" in Berlin.

""It's like we have a companion. I have this companion — that when people meet the companion in the real world, they smile and they're like: 'Oh my God, Bill and Ted — excellent, party on! Strange things are afoot at the Circle K!'""

The two have a certain infectiousness, added Winter.

""To have a five-year-old come running up to you in the street and feeling like they know you and they're happy to see you — that's a pretty sweet thing.""

But does this close the chapter on Bill and Ted's ""bogus journey"" for Reeves and Winter?

""I don't know. This is a pretty final ending, this one,"" said Winter.

Added Reeves: ""Hopefully people enjoy the film and we'll take it from there.""

""Shadows of the Dead,"" the third thriller in Spencer Kope’s ""Special Tracking Unit"" series, opens with a car crash, the discovery of a bound woman in the trunk, and the subsequent arrest of a seemly deranged driver.

article continues below

Under questioning, the prisoner proclaims that he intended to ""fix"" the woman, that she is ""number eight,"" and that he is doing the bidding of ""the Onion King."" Concluding that there may be seven more victims and another bad guy out there, Magnus ""Steps"" Craig and Jimmy Donovan, partners in the FBI’s Special Tracking unit, set out to hunt them down. The unit specializes in finding people, whether alive or dead, and Steps has a special ability that makes him unnaturally good at it.

When Steps was just 8 years old, he got lost in the woods and nearly died of hypothermia. That changed his brain, causing him to see people as colours. Kope is referencing synesthesia, a condition in which the senses get mixed up, leading people to ""taste"" words or ""see"" music as colours. However, Kope takes this to a fantastic extreme.

His hero sees every individual as a unique colour, and those colours remain on everything they touch for years — a huge advantage for a man who makes his living as a tracker. Jimmy is the only person Steps has told about this ability, figuring quite rightly that the rest of the world will think that he is a nut.

By giving Steps this comic-book superpower, Kope has made a risky creative choice. For one thing, it makes Steps’s job easy, limiting opportunities for suspense. For another, Kope’s novels are, in every other respect, standard police procedurals. Fans of such books tend to get exasperated when police work is not accurately portrayed.

However, fans who suspend disbelief enough to accept Kope’s risk are likely to admire the plot’s twists and turns, the author’s skilful character development, and his ability to bring the Washington state coastal setting vividly to life.

Although Kope does not to inspire comparisons to Joseph Wambaugh, his prose style is remarkably good for a career law enforcement official who currently works as a crime analyst for the Whatcom County, Washington, sheriff’s office. He speaks to the reader in an engaging, chatty voice, as if telling the story to his best friend.

Actors’ Equity Association filed a labour grievance against Disney World, saying its members faced retaliation for demanding the coronavirus tests before Disney World's theme parks reopened to visitors last month after being closed since March because of the pandemic. About 220 actors and singers initially were called back to work, but that invitation was rescinded after the union made public its concerns about the lack of testing, according to the union.

It was unclear how many actors and singers would be called back now that an agreement has been signed.

Transport Canada data obtained by The Canadian Press this week shows 75 per cent of the $300-million program has already been spoken for, just 15 months into its three-year mandate.

The rebate, which provides up to $5,000 back on the purchase or lease of a new battery vehicle, or a battery-gasoline hybrid one, began May 1, 2019, and was supposed to run until April 30, 2022.

But as of July 31, more than $225 million had been paid out to 53,510 drivers.

""It's no surprise to me,"" said Daniel Breton, president of Electric Mobility Canada, a non-profit agency pushing for the electrification of transportation.

Electric car sales, as a share of overall vehicle purchases, have steadily grown from two per cent of all sales in 2018 to three per cent last year, and to almost four per cent in the first three months of 2020.

But the rate of uptake is heavily concentrated in just three provinces. Quebec and British Columbia, which have sales quotas for electric cars and provincial rebates on top of the federal one, together account for 86 per cent of all the rebates.

Ontario, which had a provincial rebate until 2019, accounted for another 12 per cent, with the remaining two per cent divided among the other seven provinces and the territories.

Breton said the additional provincial rebate makes buying electric cars more attractive in Quebec and B.C. but car makers are also shipping more electric cars there because their dealers have quotas for sales. Availability of electric models is limited, and many drivers have to wait weeks or months for one.

Electric Mobility Canada wants Ottawa to expand the program to include used cars and to increase the maximum purchase price of the cars that qualify for a rebate. SUVs and pickup trucks, which are more expensive, are set to come onto the market. In 2019, almost three in every four passenger vehicles sold were SUVs and pickups.

Cara Clairman, CEO of the non-profit advocacy group Plug'n Drive, says she hopes Ottawa will provide more money for rebates when the current allotment runs out because they are making a difference.

""I think we do need a few more years of it,"" she said. ""You have to look at it as a climate-change program.""

Canada has set targets to have 10 per cent of all passenger vehicles sold be electric by 2025, 30 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2040. Breton said that won't happen if the rebate isn't expanded.

Breton is also looking for the rebates to be extended to used electric and hybrid vehicles, which are now more easy to find than new ones in many cases. A 10-per-cent rebate on the purchase of a used electric car was mentioned in the mandate letter for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains last fall but has not yet been announced.

Transport Minister Marc Garneau was instructed in his mandate letter to do more to make the electric car sales quotas. Before the pandemic, he indicated he was looking at what more to do, including extending or expanding the rebate program. Something was expected in the March federal budget, delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Garneau's spokeswoman was noncommittal Thursday when asked if the rebate program would be expanded.

""This specific program continues and consumers are able to make use of the incentive,"" Livia Belcea said in an email. ""Any changes in funding for the program would be reviewed at the appropriate time and as needed.""

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""","INVERMAY, Sask. — People could always tell when Aaron Ogden entered a room.

The 19-year-old had a big presence, said his father, Mark Ogden. He was a prankster, a one-of-a-kind character who would sit and talk to anybody as if he'd known them for years.

article continues below

""He wasn't afraid to make friends,"" Ogden, 50, said in a phone interview. ""This is just the way he was.

""Really easy to talk to.""

People remembered the young man's outgoing personality at his funeral this week. He died in a Calgary hospital last Saturday after collapsing on a run.

His father, a trucker, was able to be by his son's side.

He said a major blood clot had formed around a stent placed in his son's aorta. The stent was necessary after he survived a serious highway accident on his way to work last year.

""It was a miracle, really.""

Ogden said while in hospital before his death, his son told him he was supposed to go for a CT scan in June while still living in Saskatchewan near Yorkton.

It was a routine checkup on the stent, but the appointment was postponed because of restrictions around the COVID-19 pandemic and never rescheduled.

""I didn't think nothing of it at the time, but I mulled it over ... as we watched him decline,"" Ogden said.

""It hit me. He was trying to tell me: 'This shouldn't have happened.'""

The father believes that had his son's scan not been cancelled, doctors might have found the blood clot in time.

Ogden wants all postponed hospital procedures done immediately.

""People's lives are being lost,"" he said. ""These COVID rules are way too far.""

Ogden believes the Saskatchewan Health Authority bears responsibility for his son's death.

""Somebody needs to be held to account.""

The health authority halted hundreds of non-urgent surgeries, procedures and diagnostics in March to brace for the pandemic.

Two months later, when the government felt it had a handle on the spread of the novel coronavirus, it announced the resumption of health services would be staggered.

""Emergency and urgent patients are the priority for services, including diagnostic imaging,"" said Corey Miller, vice-president of provincial programs at the health authority.

""The determination of the priority is based on the evaluation of the referring physician in consultation with the patient.""

Miller said they are reviewing Ogden's case and have reached out to his family.

He said the health authority is working through the backlog of exams that were delayed during the first few months of the pandemic.

More than 1,500 CT appointments which had been booked were postponed, he said.

Ogden questions why something like a CT scan couldn't be performed in Yorkton, where the risk of COVID-19 was low.

As of Friday, health officials reported five active cases in the region, which has only seen 33 infections in total since the pandemic hit Saskatchewan.

Cheryl Camillo, a professor with the University of Regina's Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy, says speaking generally, delaying non-essential services to respond to COVID-19 was the responsible thing to do because the virus was new and spreading quickly.

""The risks are that some people don't get the essential and urgent services because so much of the workforce and the resources of the health system move towards responding to COVID,"" said the health systems researcher.

""It's very human for people to get frustrated because health care is something that is so personal.""

She says another risk of scaling back is that people can lose confidence in a health system some may perceive as having overplanned for the pandemic.

Health officials are in the tough spot of having to prepare for the worst case scenario and what could be a rapid change in case numbers, she says.

During the pandemic Camillo's own grandmother died in a long-term care home in the United States from isolation and depression, she says.

""I suffered an individual loss of my otherwise pretty healthy grandmother, but despite how profoundly sad that makes me, I understand and would defend the care home's decision to lock down.

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""

The agency said no officers were on the balcony with Korchinski-Paquet at the time, and there's no evidence the officers committed a crime.

Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked protests in the city and calls to change the way police deal with people experiencing mental health crises.","TORONTO — Regis Korchinski-Paquet fell to her death while trying to sidestep onto a neighbour's balcony, said a report released Wednesday by Ontario's police watchdog, which concludes there are no grounds to charge officers who were in her home at the time.

The lengthy report from the Special Investigations Unit notes that Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked ""important conversations"" about the ways in which police interact with Black and Indigenous people, but says there was no evidence of police wrongdoing or ""overt"" racism in the incident itself.

article continues below

Director Joseph Martino said race may have been a factor in the events leading up to the death of the 29-year-old, who was both Indigenous and Black, but that examining systemic issues in policing is not his role.

""The task before me was a narrow one — namely, to determine whether there were reasonable grounds, on the evidence collected by the SIU, to believe that any one or more of the officers who responded to Ms. Korchinski-Paquet's apartment committed a criminal offence in connection with her death,"" he wrote.

The Special Investigations Unit said six officers were in the 29-year-old woman's Toronto home when she fell from the balcony in May, while her mother and brother were nearby.

The agency's report says Korchinski-Paquet's mother called police to the home because the two siblings were fighting — ""bottles and punches had been thrown"" — and she wanted both of them removed from the apartment.

It says Korchinski-Paquet and her brother also called 911 during the argument, which began as a dispute over the volume of the TV.

When the 911 operator asked about any mental health issues, the report says, the family indicated that Korchinski-Paquet had epilepsy and had had seizures earlier in the day.

It says that after police arrived, two officers blocked Korchinski-Paquet from getting to her mother and brother before allowing her back into the apartment so she could use the bathroom.

She then went out onto the 24th-floor balcony and prevented officers from joining her by holding her body against the door.

""Very quickly, Ms. Korchinski-Paquet scaled the balcony railing and the (subject officer) lost sight of her,"" the report reads.

She then tried to scale the balcony and cross onto the adjoining one, which is when she lost her balance and fell to her death, the report reads.

The agency said no officers were on the balcony with Korchinski-Paquet at the time, and there's no evidence the officers committed a crime.

Martino said that the officers seemed to be confused about whether epilepsy was a mental health condition and if they should or could detain Korchinski-Paquet under the Mental Health Act.

""The limited layperson's research I have conducted of the matter suggests that epilepsy is a neurological disorder with manifestations that can be mental as well as physical,"" Martino wrote. ""Be that as it may, I cannot fault the officers for failing to take Ms. Korchinski-Paquet into custody prior to her scaling the balcony railing. She had not given them any indication that she wished to harm herself and was professing to be the victim of an assault at the hands of her brother.""

He also said the officers tried to de-escalate the situation between Korchinski-Paquet's family.

The decision comes after the arm's-length agency interviewed all six officers, along with 15 civilian witnesses.

The agency said investigators also received a written statement from Korchinski-Paquet's father, with whom she had been speaking on the phone moments before her death.

Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked protests in the city and calls to change the way police deal with people experiencing mental health crises.

Martino noted that Korchinski-Paquet died just days after George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, was killed when an officer pressed a knee against his neck for nearly nine minutes, at a time when there was increased scrutiny over the relationship between police and racialized people.

In Toronto, thousands of protesters took to the streets on May 30, three days after the incident in Korchinski-Paquet's apartment. Several smaller marches followed it over the next several weeks.

Two city counsellors then brought forward a motion to defund Toronto police, but it was struck down in favour of introducing body-worn cameras to the force.

The Toronto Police Services Board, the body that oversees the force, then launched a series of town halls to discuss systemic racism in policing, though many protesters said such information-gathering had been done before to little effect.

Toronto police and Korchinski-Paquet’s family were expected to comment on the SIU report at separate news conferences later Wednesday.

Other speakers tonight include senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, who is leaving the White House at the end of the month, and Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn.

A devout Catholic, Pence and wife Karen are expected to carry the evangelical banner into Day 3 of the convention, touting Trump as the best choice for Americans who consider themselves social conservatives.

Democrats seized on the opportunity, deploying the openly gay Pete Buttigieg, one of Joe Biden's former presidential rivals, in a fundraising missive denouncing Pence's ""divisive, anti-LGBTQ politics"" and ""archaic worldview.""

As head of the White House coronavirus force, Pence is also likely to address an issue that has so far received relatively scant attention from convention speakers: the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Tuesday, economic adviser Larry Kudlow spoke of the crisis in the past tense, even though the pandemic continues to rage across the U.S., while only first lady Melania Trump expressed any empathy for the more than 178,000 Americans killed by the virus to date.

""My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one, and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering,"" she said. ""I know many people are anxious, and some feel helpless. I want you to know you are not alone.""

Kudlow, meanwhile, framed the novel coronavirus as ancient history in the U.S.

""It was awful — health and economic impacts were tragic, hardship and heartbreak were everywhere,"" Kudlow said. ""But presidential leadership came swiftly and effectively, with an extraordinary rescue for health and safety to successfully fight the COVID virus.""

Of the racial unrest roiling the country — fuelled this week by another police shooting of an unarmed Black man, this time in Wisconsin — Melania Trump urged protesters to channel their furious energy into positive change, not wanton destruction. She also resisted the urge to ""divide the country further"" by beating up on Democrats.

But she raised eyebrows by framing her husband, notorious for playing fast and loose with the truth, as an honest and authentic human being.

""Total honesty is what we as citizens deserve from our president,"" she said. ""Whether you like it or not, you always know what he's thinking.""

Trump has been putting the power of the presidency under a brazen partisan spotlight, and did so again Tuesday, pardoning a convicted bank robber who now helps prisoners reintegrate into society and presiding over a naturalization ceremony for five new American citizens. His wife's speech was delivered from the White House Rose Garden.

And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's pre-taped speech from a Jerusalem rooftop, coming in the middle of a diplomatic mission, did not escape the attention of some members of Congress. Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is accusing Pompeo of violating federal law by mixing government business with partisan interests.

Loblaw Companies Ltd., which began offering COVID-19 testing for patients at a handful of its Alberta pharmacy locations in June, plans to expand the program to all 234 of its pharmacies in the province by Sept. 1.

article continues below

The company says it has reached out to all 10 provinces to discuss in-store testing outside Alberta, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford this week acknowledging the possibility.

The swab tests are only for those with no symptoms or any known contact with coronavirus patients and may be useful for teachers returning to school or Canadians who take care of an older family member, said Theresa Firestone, head of health and wellness at Shoppers Drug Mart. Loblaw-owned pharmacy locations include Shoppers stores as well as Independent Foods and No Frills.

""It's very convenient. We're in every community. The other plus is they don't have to line up with people who may have symptoms. We've shared that with Ontario and with other provinces, so at this point we’re looking forward to what they may decide,"" Firestone said.

London Drugs also conducts COVID-19 tests in Alberta. It began offering the service at six locations during the past two weeks and plans to roll it out at nine more by October. Like Shoppers, it bills Alberta Health Services for testing costs.

The service builds on other responses to the pandemic such as online pharmacist consultations and a pilot program where patients consult virtually with doctors in a private room in the store.

London Drugs is among the pharmacy retailers beefing up their role in a health-care system grappling with an aging population.

""With the extended hours of operation, you can basically go in when our stores are open and be able to find a pharmacist to ask a question. So what we’re able to do at that point is basically help triage the system,"" said Chris Chiew, head of pharmacy at the Richmond, B.C.-based retailer.

London Drugs has also hired diabetes educators to test blood sugar levels and assist patients with weight management and diet.

Shoppers has stepped even further into the realm of physicians, opening one of three planned medical clinics with doctors who cater to a roster of patients and walk-in services.

""There are a number of Canadians who don’t have access to a family physician. And we thought there was an opportunity for us to really play a role here in terms of access,"" Firestone said.

Drugstores can also handle the bureaucratic side of health care, freeing up doctors to spend more time with patients, she said.

""Looking for PPE (personal protective equipment), sorting out their waiting rooms so that people are socially distanced, managing virtual care...we’re able to take that burden on for them,"" Firestone said.

In 2018, Shoppers launched its Wellwise store chain to sell assisted-living devices aimed at older Canadians. More recently, it began to offer tips and videos online designed to help ward off depression and anxiety.

Metro Inc. declined to comment on any attempts to provide COVID-19 testing. The bulk of the company's Jean Coutu drugstores are located in Quebec, which unlike some provinces does not allow pharmacists to conduct testing via nose and mouth swabs.

Bank of Nova Scotia. (TSX:BNS). Down 38 cents, or 0.67 per cent, to $56.10. The Bank of Nova Scotia's profit was weighed down in its latest quarter by mounting provisions for bad loans and its Latin American operations. The Toronto-based bank revealed Tuesday that its third-quarter profit slipped to $1.3 billion from $1.98 billion a year ago, while its provisions for credit losses totalled $2.18 billion for the quarter, up from $1.85 billion last quarter and $713 million in the year prior. ""We know that structural damage has been done to the economy. It's going to require a lot of quarters of clean up from here, but we do view this quarter's PCL as our high-water mark,"" Daniel Moore, the bank's chief risk officer, said during a conference call with financial analysts.

Bank of Montreal (TSX:BMO). Up $4.38 cents, or 5.7 per cent, to $81.23. BMO Financial Group put aside a hefty amount of money again to protect itself from bad loans even as it posted a $1.23-billion profit in its latest quarter. The Toronto-based bank said Tuesday that provisions for credit losses amounted to $1.05 billion in its third quarter, up from $306 million last year and down from $1.11 billion last quarter. Patrick Cronin, the bank's chief risk officer, attributed the high provisions to the COVID-19 pandemic, but said he has confidence in the bank's ability to operate in such an environment.

The Canadian Association of Broadcasters issued a report on Wednesday warning of potential closures and widespread job cuts as private TV and radio broadcasters face a cumulative projected revenue shortfall of up to $1.06 billion by the end of 2022.

Most vulnerable are the country's AM radio stations, the report said, as well as other independent private radio and TV operations in smaller markets across the country.

The study, titled ""The Crisis in Canadian Media and the Future of Local Broadcasting,"" was commissioned by the CAB, which represents the majority of private broadcasters in Canada, and conducted through Winnipeg-based independent media economics consultancy Communications Management Inc.

The CAB says it's concerned about the fallout from a substantial erosion in local advertising revenues over recent months.

Radio stations may be hardest hit in the short term, the report suggests, partly due to many advertisers pulling back on their spending in the pandemic and hastening a decline in the media industry's revenues.

Private radio ad revenues are expected to be $383 million below last year, it said.

The report's projections suggest that without further government support those declines could mean as many as 50 private local radio stations go out of business over the next four to six months.

Another 150 radio stations could topple in the 18 months that follow, it said, leading to as many as 2,000 job losses.

The CAB is calling on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to take swift action by establishing a ""more fair and sustainable future"" for local media.

Last month, the organization sent an emergency application to the CRTC requesting permission for broadcasters to be relieved of certain terms of their agreements, such as spending requirements on Canadian programming, for the broadcast year that ends Aug. 31.

Lenore Gibson, chair of the CAB, said broadcasters have ""done their utmost to cut expenses"" in areas such as administration, and ""the last thing that they want to do is cut into programming costs, but that's the only area that's left now.""

The CAB is urging the federal government to provide emergency regulatory relief as well as greater ""targeted support"" for the industry starting this fall.

Without greater financial measures in place, the CAB says the effects could leave many communities with only national and international media organizations to provide them with most of their news, effectively eliminating most community coverage of local politics, health and education in some regions of the country.

Bo Horvat scored twice, and Tyler Toffoli and Elias Pettersson each had a goal and two assists as the Canucks defeated the Golden Knights 5-2 at Rogers Place.

The best-of-seven second-round series is tied 1-1. Game 3 goes Thursday.

Forty-eight hours earlier, the Golden Knights, now 8-2 in the post-season, had manhandled the Canucks en route to a 5-0 pounding in Game 1.

""For us as a team we wanted to bounce back from Game 1. We weren't happy with that,"" said Pettersson.

""We played a good game. We should be happy about it but (we need) a short-term memory and be ready for Game 3.""

Goaltender Jacob Markstrom made 38 saves for the win while Robin Lehner stopped 22 shots for Vegas. It's the first time Vegas has allowed more than five goals in a game in the return-to-play tournament.

It was the first game back for Toffoli since the opening game of the qualifying round against the Minnesota Wild on Aug. 2. The NHL is not releasing information on injuries, but Toffoli had been seen in a walking boot.

Toffoli jumped over the boards for his first shift in the first period and scored nine seconds later, taking a cross-crease pass from Pettersson to put the puck into a yawning net. He then made it 2-0 on the power play, delivering a tape-to-tape pass to an incoming Horvat, who blasted it past Lehner.

""It's fun to get back in the lineup and get a big win and tie this series up,"" said Toffoli, who had been acquired at the trade deadline from the Los Angeles Kings. He had put up 10 points in his first 10 games with the Canucks before the regular season ended March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I made some phone calls yesterday, talked to a lot of people. It was a busy day,"" said Toffoli. ""It was good obviously getting the OK from everybody (to play). I got all excited. Felt like I was coming back to my first playoff series.""

Vancouver coach Travis Green said the 5-0 loss was their worst game of the playoffs and that Game 2 was a must-win.

""You go down two (games) against that team early in the series it would be tough and just mentally, too (to come back),"" he said.

""We were better with the puck, played a more direct game. I thought we were better on our feet, quicker. That's a good hockey team. I thought we did a good job of making them defend more than we did the first game.""

Despite being down by two goals in the second period, the Golden Knights looked like they were going to run the Canucks out of the rink again.

Markstrom kept the Canucks alive as Vegas tilted the ice and turned his net into a shooting gallery, blasting away for 22 shots in the period. Vegas got one goal back from Alex Tuch before Pettersson scored on a cross-ice feed from Alex Edler to make it 3-1 heading into the third.

""That really was a back-breaker,"" said Vegas head coach Peter DeBoer. ""You're down 3-1 and you have nothing to show for the work you put in to try and get back in the game.""

Tuch added: ""We knew Vancouver wasn't happy with the way they played last game and we knew they were going to come out flying. And we decided instead of being prepared, (to) be surprised by that for some reason.""

Vancouver iced the game 18 seconds into the third on Horvat's second goal. Then the frustration finally got to Vegas.

First, Max Pacioretty grabbed J.T. Miller by the head and threw him down after the whistle for a roughing penalty. Tuch got a double minor for pummelling Jake Virtanen while the Vancouver forward lay on the ice.

Pacioretty scored late for Vegas and Tanner Pearson added the final Vancouver goal into an empty net.

Horvat had not found the scoresheet since scoring two goals in each of the first two games against the St. Louis Blues in the first round.

Pettersson has been a steady point-getter throughout the playoffs but had been shut down by Vegas in Game 1, limited to no shots on net and one blocked shot.

Markstrom, in his first playoff series, has been the locomotive pulling the Canucks' playoff train. He allowed just nine goals on 121 shots (.926 save percentage) against Minnesota in the first round while registering his first playoff shutout. He saved 29 of 34 against the Blues (.930).

The series is being played at a fan-less Rogers Place. Players are isolating between contests to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This was Williams’ fifth match since professional tennis resumed amid the coronavirus pandemic after a hiatus of nearly six months — and all five have gone three sets. She is 3-2 in that stretch.

The result against No. 13 seed Sakkari, and particularly the way the match ended, was hardly promising for Williams as the U.S. Open’s start approaches next week.

The Western & Southern Open is usually held in Ohio but was moved to the U.S. Open’s site in Flushing Meadows this year to make for a two-event, no-spectator ""bubble"" during the pandemic.

In men's play, Canada's Milos Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Andy Murray. Raonic, from Thornhill, Ont., is the last Canadian remaining in the draw.

Williams was seemingly in control early, serving for the first set at 5-3, 30-0, when things began to unravel. She missed two backhands in a row, then put a forehand into the net to set up a break point, and walked over to the stand holding her towel at the back of the court (the ball people normally handle towels for players, but not during COVID-19).

That’s when chair umpire Aurelie Tourte called a time violation. On the following point, Williams sailed a forehand long to get broken.

At the ensuing changeover, the 23-time Grand Slam champion argued with Tourte, saying: ""I mean, I’m getting my own towels. That’s not fair. You should tell me on the sidelines next time if I need to play faster. Believe me, I will. ... You didn't even give me a warning.""

While Williams eventually did grab that set, she again frittered away a 5-3 lead in the second, plus a 4-1 edge in the tiebreaker. When she sat after the second set, the 38-year-old American tossed her racket over her shoulder the way an office worker might flip a crumpled piece of paper toward a trash can.

Williams came out flat in the third set, as if she’d rather be anywhere else. She double-faulted four times in the second game, including on Sakkari’s eighth break chance, to make it 2-0 and that was pretty much that.

Hours earlier, Novak Djokovic’s neck felt much better, and his tennis looked much better, in a 6-2, 6-4 victory over unseeded American Tennys Sandgren that improved the No. 1-ranked man to 20-0 in 2020.

""Actually, I’m pleasantly surprised with the way I recovered and felt today — just overall, physically, but also with the neck, specifically, because that was a little bit of a concern,"" said Djokovic, who will be eyeing his 18th Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open. ""Going back four, five days, I did struggle quite a lot.""

Djokovic was treated by a trainer and played sluggishly in his opening match Monday, but he was at his best from the outset against Sandgren and saved all four break points he faced.

Djokovic will face 34th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff in the quarterfinals. The other quarterfinal in the top half of the draw will be defending champion Daniil Medvedev against No. 8 seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Reilly Opelka, a 6-foot-11 American who is ranked 39th, delivered 19 aces and knocked off 2019 U.S. Open semifinalist Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 7-6 (4). Opelka next meets No. 4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, whose 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4) win over No. 16 John Isner was interrupted by a rain delay of nearly 1 1/2 hours late in the first set.

Also interrupted by the weather was Raonic's victory over the three-time Grand Slam champion. Raonic, a Wimbledon runner-up in 2016, has held all 29 games he’s served so far in the tournament.

""I have done the work,"" Raonic said. ""I have put in the effort, and I'm just happy that this quickly the pieces are coming together.""

This was Murray's first tournament appearance since November. He missed time due to a pelvic injury and is playing on a metal hip after two operations on that joint.

""Didn’t play well. It was not a good day,"" Murray said. ""The positives are that I got three matches in. Physically, I pulled up OK.""

Women’s quarterfinal matchups set earlier in the day were two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka against Anett Kontaveit, former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka against Ons Jabeur, and 83rd-ranked American qualifier Jessica Pegula against No. 14 Elise Mertens.

He was 5 under after the front nine Tuesday at Ozarks National when he hit driver at the par-4 10th. The ball wound up in such heavy rough that Mickelson couldn't find it, forcing him to take a penalty stroke. He still wound up making a long putt to salvage bogey, and that gave him some momentum for the rest of the round.

""I was able to get right back to even par on the back side with a birdie on the next hole, and then I made a couple more coming in,"" said Mickelson, whose 7-under 64 left him 17 under.

That was good for a four-shot lead over Tim Petrovic and Rod Pampling, who will be his playing partners for the final round. Mike Weir of Bright's Grove, Ont., (69) was nine shots off the lead at 8 under.

""I've been putting really well,"" Mickelson said. ""Today I didn't drive it the way I've been driving it. I kind of a hung a few drives, so I'm going to the range and try to work on that now. But when I come out tomorrow I'll try to be a little bit more aggressive with the driver and see if I can make a few more birdies.""

A few more? He's already made 19 of them in his first 36 holes.

Playing in the final group and with the shadows getting long, Mickelson picked up right where he left off after his opening-round 61. He made birdie at the third and then rattled off three straight beginning at the par-4 fifth, where he nearly chipped in for eagle.

Petrovic tried to make a run at Mickelson, but even one of his career-low rounds only got him so close. His putter went cold down the stretch and a poor approach at the par-4 finishing hole resulted in bogey.

Mickelson added a bridie at the ninth, the only hole he bogeyed on Monday, after a pretty flop shot over the bunker. After the lost ball at the 10th, Mickelson responded by adding two more birdies.

The second of them at the par-3 12th was a backhanded tap-in. His approach shot barely carried onto the front edge of the green, then nestled up to about an inch from the hole.

Mickelson could still squander the lead in the final round Wednesday, when tee times were moved to the early morning because of expected bad weather in the afternoon. But given the quality of his short game through 36 holes, the more pressing question is whether he could break the PGA Tour Champions' 54-hole scoring record of 191 — shared by Bruce Fleisher, Loren Roberts, Bernhard Langer, David Frost and Rocco Mediate.

Mickelson, who decided to make his debut on the over-50 tour to continue his U.S. Open prep after he was eliminated from the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, would need to shoot 65 in his final round Wednesday to move atop the list.

Petrovic and Pampling each shot 64-65 over the first two rounds. Rocco Mediate struggled coming in and was at 12 under.

K.J. Choi was another shot back, and Steve Stricker and David McKenzie were at 10 under.

Moments later, the Chicago White Sox right-hander threw the final pitch in a truly bizarre performance.

article continues below

A no-fan no-no.

With the seats at Guaranteed Rate Field empty, Giolito pitched the first no-hitter of the pandemic-delayed season, striking out 13 in leading the White Sox over the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 Tuesday night.

""2020 has been a very strange year,"" said Giolito, who conducted a postgame interview while wearing a mask. ""Obviously a lot of weird stuff going on with COVID and the state of the world, so may as well throw this in the mix.""

Sounds like he didn't mind that nobody saw it. Well, almost no one.

After right fielder Adam Engel extended on the run to catch Erik Gonzalez’s slicing drive toward the line for the final out, the hollers of Giolito’s teammates in the middle of the diamond echoed around the stadium.

""I’m just stoked for Lucas and so happy and ecstatic and emotional for Lucas,"" Engel said. ""It stinks we couldn’t celebrate the way most no-hitters get celebrated.""

The smallest crowd listed for any no-hitter in the majors over the last 100 years came in 1944, when a mere 1,014 watched Cincinnati’s Clyde Shoun beat the Braves at Crosley Field.

Nowhere close to that number on this night, not with the park that holds over 40,000 closed to fans because of virus protocols.

Suffice to say, years from now when White Sox fans fondly remember Giolito’s gem, there will not be, say, 100,000 or so people claiming they were there to see it in person.

At one point early in the game, some members of grounds crew drifted in sight, but that was about it outside of the teams.

An All-Star last year, the 26-year-old Giolito (3-2) matched his career high for strikeouts set in his previous start against Detroit.

Only a four-pitch walk to Gonzalez leading off the fourth inning got in Giolito’s way of perfection. That was only runner he permitted while throwing 101 pitches

""I’ve been working for this type of game for a while now and it’s really cool that we got it done,"" Giolito said.

Giolito relied on his changeup and fastball to make quick work of the Pirates, who came into the game batting just .229 and have the worst record in the majors. Six of their starters finished the game hitting under .199 this season.

The White Sox rushed toward the mound after the final out in Giolito’s first career no-hitter. Giolito hugged catcher James McCann as the Chicago players joined the party.

The South Side of Chicago normally rattles with fireworks after a home win -- this is the club that gave the game the exploding scoreboard -- but the park remained silent as the dugout emptied.

Giolito, meanwhile, was locked in his own zone in the later innings, fully aware of what was at stake.

""After the seventh, six more outs, looking at who I was facing, became very, very, very possible,"" he said, ""and then we were able to get it done.""

Giolito said his approach never wavered.

""Just staying with the same, like, mental routine for every single pitch. One pitch at a time. Full focus, full execution, straight through the target,"" he said.

Giolito pitched the 19th no-hitter in White Sox history — second most to the Dodgers' 23 — and first since Philip Humber threw a perfect game at Seattle in 2012. This was the seventh time the Pirates have been held hitless, with Washington’s Max Scherzer having done it in 2015.

White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson made a nifty play on a grounder by Bryan Reynolds up the middle in the seventh to preserve the gem, helped by first baseman Jose Abreu’s stretch at the bag.

In the ninth, Gonzalez hit a liner that Engel, a fleet centre fielder for most of his career, caught on the run at knee-high height.

""Yeah man, I think I got it,"" Gonzalez said. ""With that at-bat, I was a little bit mad because I don’t want to be part of history.""

Giolito improved to 30-28 in his big league career. He made his debut with Washington in 2016, then was traded after that season to the White Sox in a package for outfielder Adam Eaton.

Giolito gave up a major league-high 118 earned runs in 2018, his first full season in Chicago.

""I was pretty much bottom of the league in almost every stat,"" Giolito said. ""I kind of had to ... learn from failure to learn my true potential.""

He added: ""I always envisioned that I’d throw a no-hitter in the big leagues.""

Giolito threw the first no-hitter at Guaranteed Rate Field since Minnesota’s Francisco Liriano did it in 2011.

The White Sox, who’ve won eight of their last nine, ended the Pirates’ season-best winning streak at three games.

Giolito was dominant in his previous start, too, fanning 13 against Detroit and allowing just three hits in seven innings. The victory over Pittsburgh was his third career shutout.

Chicago’s first three batters reached in the second and all three came home one at a time after Engel’s groundout and singles Anderson and Eloy Jimenez. McCann added a sacrifice fly in the third off Steven Brault (0-1).

TRAINER’S ROOM

Pirates: RH reliever Keone Kela was available to pitch after leaving Friday’s loss to Milwaukee with forearm tightness. … Infielders Colin Moran (collision) and Kevin Newman (abdomen) also were on the bench after leaving Sunday’s game.

White Sox: McCann stayed in the game after being struck near his left hand by a second-inning pitch from Brault. ... Jimenez appeared to be getting treatment near the mound after the celebration, but manager Rick Renteria said he walked off under his own power.

LHP Dallas Keuchel (4-2, 2.65) looks for his third straight win Wednesday afternoon against Pirates RHP Trevor Williams (1-4, 3.70).

Down 1-0 in the series and playing well, Tampa Bay then grabbed its first lead in more than 110 minutes of action midway through the third period only to see Boston tie it up with under four minutes to go in regulation.

""Adversity strikes in the weirdest ways,"" Cooper said. ""You never know when it's going to happen.

""Sometimes you're just dealt ... a sandwich that doesn't taste very good, if you know what I mean.""

And deal with it they did.

Ondrej Palat scored at 4:40 of overtime as the Lightning defeated the Bruins 4-3 to even their second-round playoff series 1-1.

Blake Coleman added two goals in regulation for the Lightning, while Nikita Kucherov had the other. Andrei Vasilevskiy made 22 saves to get the win.

""If there was one message that was going on it was we liked everything that was going on about the game,"" Cooper said. ""I know it sounds so cliche, but we just had to stick with it. Some teams, if you have mental weakness at all, you're probably sitting there saying, 'Poor us.'

""But it's just not been this group. That's not how they operate.""

Brad Marchand buried his second of the night to tie things with under four minutes left in the third period for the Bruins, while Nick Ritchie also scored. David Pastrnak added two assists for Boston, which got 36 stops from Jaroslav Halak.

The teams don't have much time to digest the result, with Game 3 of the best-of-seven matchup set for Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET back inside the fan-less Scotiabank Arena.

Tampa, which beat the Columbus Blue Jackets in quintuple overtime of Game 1 in the opening round before closing out the series in the extra period of Game 5 on a pair of goals from Brayden Point, got the winner after Boston couldn't clear its zone.

Patrick Maroon tried a wraparound that Halak stopped, but Palat was there to bury the rebound to score his first of the post-season and send the Lightning pouring off their bench in celebration.

""It's obviously big-time frustrating any time you lose a game and especially in that fashion,"" Bruins centre Sean Kuraly said. ""We thought we were trending in the right direction, (thinking) momentum may be swinging our way. You get the puck close to the blue line a couple times and you don't get it out, and against a good team that's what happens.

""It ends up in the back of your net.""

Acquired prior to February's trade deadline from the New Jersey Devils, Coleman gave Tampa its first lead of the series at 10:40 of the third after taking a stretch pass from Victor Hedman. The Lightning centre moved in alone on Halak and snuck an off-speed shot through the five-hole after getting slashed by Bruins defenceman Connor Clifton.

Boston, however, responded with 3:58 left in regulation when Marchand finished off a pretty passing play. With the Bruins in the middle of a change — Patrice Bergeron would normally be on the ice — Kuraly took a feed from Pastrnak and quickly found Marchand to bury his sixth and knot things up.

The Bruins, who triumphed 3-2 in Game 1 on the back of Halak's 35-save performance, took a 2-1 lead with 5:27 left in the second on a power play when Pastrnak faked a one-timer before sliding a pass to Marchand at the side of the net.

Tampa responded 56 seconds later after some great work from Point. The diminutive centre twisted and turned in the Bruins zone before finding Kevin Shattenkirk, whose shot was tipped in by Kucherov for his third.

The Lightning dressed seven defencemen with Ryan McDonagh (undisclosed), who has averaged a team-high 26:07 of ice time in the post-season, out injured after leaving midway through the third period of Game 1. Veteran blue-liners Luke Schenn and Braydon Coburn drew in, while Carter Verhaeghe was scratched up front.

Boston owned the best record in the NHL when the league suspended its season because of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, but dropped to the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference after losing all three of its games in the round-robin portion of the restart.

The Bruins found their groove in the first round of the usual 16-team playoff bracket, disposing of the Carolina Hurricanes in five games.

Tampa, meanwhile, had the second-best mark in the East and was fourth overall when the schedule was halted. The Lightning finished second in the round-robin and then downed Columbus.

The Bruins jumped out to a 1-0 lead at 3:14 of Tuesday's first period after Tampa defenceman Zach Bogosian's stick disintegrated at the offensive blue line. Boston broke the other way, with Ritchie stuffing his first past Vasilevskiy, who thought he had the puck covered — much to Cooper's chagrin.

The Lightning responded a couple minutes later when Barclay Goodrow tipped Coburn's point shot up and over Halak. The Bruins, however, correctly challenged for offside after Point was a fraction of a second too slow exiting the Boston zone on the tag up.

Cooper fired a number of expletives at the officials when the call was reversed, but was back smiling on the bench after a surprising burst from an unlikely source eventually knotted the score.

Bogosian, a bruising blue-liner known mostly for his physical play, split two Boston defenders, and as he was getting knocked down fed a diving Coleman, who slid his second past Halak before crashing into the net at 12:42.

""I saw Bogo picking up some speed,"" Coleman said. ""He just kind of had that look in his eye like he was about to do something. I just made it a point to get up into play with him, try to give him an option.

""He made a heck of a play.""

It was also the first sign the Lightning weren't going to be fazed by that early adversity.

""Any time there's a mishap, you just turn the page,"" Cooper said of his roster. ""It was needed tonight, I'll tell you that, because they need to be rewarded for the work they were doing.

""And in the end, they were.""

George had shot 29% in the series and endured fans' wrath on social media. He said he spoke to the team psychiatrist before Game 5.

""I mean, whatever it was, the bubble got the best of me,"" George said. ""I was just in a dark place. I really wasn’t here. I checked out. The past couple of games, it was just difficult.""

George said it didn't feel like the playoffs until his teammates decided to create the atmosphere that was lacking inside the NBA's Walt Disney World bubble.

""I came in with that mindset that this is Staples, we’re at home,"" he said. ""The place is packed. I really had to psych myself up. I thought the whole team took that and we ran with it. We created our own energy. We decided to dictate this game.""

Doncic said Clippers forward Marcus Morris might have stepped on his ankle intentionally early in the third quarter.

""I don’t want to talk to him,"" Doncic said. ""He’s just saying a lot of bad stuff to me all the game. I don’t want to talk to him. I’ve just got to move on. Like I said, everybody’s going to have their own opinion. I just hope it wasn’t intentional. If that was intentional, that’s very bad.""

BIGGER THAN BASKETBALL

Clippers coach Doc Rivers was emotional while discussing the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which has sparked national outrage and some violent protests. Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back while his three children watched.

""That video, if you watch that video — you don’t need to be Black to be outraged,"" Rivers said. ""You need to be American and outraged. How dare the Republicans talk about fear. We’re the ones that need to be scared. We’re the ones having to talk to every Black child. What white father has to give his son a talk about being careful if you get pulled over? It’s just ridiculous. It keeps going. There’s no charges. Breonna Taylor — no charges. Nothing. All we’re asking is you live up to the Constitution. That’s all we’re asking -- for everybody. For everyone.""

CARLISLE'S EJECTION

Carlisle described what led to his ejection. Hardaway had the ball at the free-throw line, and then Rivers was granted a timeout.

""My understanding in that situation is that once a shooter has the ball, a timeout cannot be called by the opposing coach,"" Carlisle said. ""I thought the call was wrong. So I was asking about it and wasn’t getting a great explanation and then it turned into a technical and then another technical. I’m just standing up for my team.""

Dr. Theresa Tam made the comments during a news conference Tuesday while responding to the Statistics Canada survey, which found nearly one-quarter of respondents unlikely or unsure whether they would get a COVID-19 vaccine.

Many experts and political leaders have touted the successful development and widespread rollout of a vaccine as essential for an eventual return to normalcy, including the full reopening of economies and ending physical distancing.

More than 76 per cent of respondents in the Statistics Canada survey indicated they would likely get inoculated if and when a vaccine is ready. Yet 14 per cent said they were somewhat or very unlikely to do so. Nine per cent remained unsure.

Those who indicated they were unlikely to get a vaccine were asked to identify the reasons for their reluctance. More than half cited a lack of confidence in its safety while a similar number said they were worried about potential risks and side effects.

About one-quarter of respondents, who were allowed to give more than one answer, said they did not consider it necessary to get the vaccine while about 10 per cent indicated they did not believe in vaccines at all.

More than one-third said they would likely just wait until the vaccine seemed safe.

The survey also indicated younger Canadians and those who don't have a university degree are more likely to be hesitant or nervous about a vaccine than those who are older and more educated.

The crowd-sourced survey of around 4,000 Canadians was conducted between June 15-21. It cannot be given a margin of error because the participants do not represent a random sample.

Asked about the survey, Tam underscored the importance of ""vaccine confidence,"" describing it as integral to the successful rollout of vaccine.

She went on to promise that regulators won't take any shortcuts with safety despite the government agreeing to several changes to the clinical-trial process to get a potential COVID-19 vaccine developed faster.

""Just because it's an accelerated process to get vaccines for Canadians does not mean we're going to shortchange anything on safety and effectiveness,"" Tam said. ""I do have confidence in our regulatory system.""

Tam also took aim at the spread of falsehoods about vaccines online.

""I do think social media and internet companies do have responsibilities in terms of their role in the space,"" she said.

""So I would look towards different partners, different government departments also coming together to look at how we better address some of the misinformation that's in that space.""

She is not the first to speak out on this issue, as some have blamed the growing number and influence of anti-vaccination groups online for a resurgence in childhood diseases such as measles.

Facebook announced last year that it would be cracking down on so-called ""anti-vaxxer"" groups, which included labelling posts deemed as containing false information about vaccines. The social media giant now being sued by one such group in California.

Josh Greenberg, a communications professor at Carleton University who has been studying Canadians' attitudes towards a COVID-19 vaccine, said safety concerns aren't unexpected, given the pressure governments and industry are facing to get something working fast.

Yet he said it is essential that Ottawa push back against misinformation campaigns, which have been growing in numbers and influence even as governments around the world have been slow to react.

""When you look at issues like COVID-19 and the campaign to ready or prepare the public for the eventual release of a vaccine, you're talking about a battle for both hearts and minds,"" Greenberg said.

""It's not just an information battle of trying to make sure that people have accurate information, but that you are persuading them in such a way that they trust the veracity of the information you're providing and they also trust the source of that information.""

While the world is rushing to find a vaccine for COVID-19, new reports of several people having been reinfected with the novel coronavirus after testing positive once before raise concerns that it might be a moving target.

Deputy chief public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo said the cases in Hong Kong, Belgium and the Netherlands highlight ongoing questions about immunity to COVID-19 and the need for an effective vaccine.

But the 23-year-old trainee priest and his roughly 20 seminarian colleagues are also preparing for a major downsize.

article continues below

After decades of dwindling interest in the priesthood, the priests-in-training are leaving the historic halls of Montreal's Grand Seminaire — which has a legacy dating back nearly to the city's founding — and moving to smaller quarters across town.

The move is hardly a surprise, given the decline in influence of the Catholic church, which once dominated Quebecers' education and social lives. The Seminaire, which once trained up to 200 priests at a time, now receives a small handful of new candidates each year to take on the eight-year training process.

Leroux said it's been ""a privilege"" to live and train in a building with so much history, ""with priests and professors that belonged to religious orders that helped found Montreal, helped sustain the city in its early years.""

While the seminarians have lived in the building since it was completed in 1857, there have been Sulpician priests on the site since the 1670s, when they carried out missionary activities. The Sulpicians have been responsible for training new priests since the 1840s.

While he'll miss the majestic chapel and the building's history, Leroux said there are advantages to the new site, such as not having people scattered all over a too-large building.

Their new home is a 60s-era former nuns' residence in the Rosemont-Petite-Patrie borough, complete with a small chapel, community spaces and room for about 20 priests.

""In the new place we'll be able to live a little more all together, share a little more community time,"" Leroux said.

Leroux said he's eager to move from the foot of Mount Royal to a much busier neighbourhood, allowing the seminarians to have much more community contact.

The Grand Seminaire is hardly the only grand religious building with dwindling occupants, according to Montreal Archbishop Christian Lepine.

Many religious communities, including the Sulpicians who own the Grand Seminaire, he said, have found the costs to sustain vast and historic buildings unsustainable.

""Financially, if you have a big building you have to fill, and you cannot use it in all it's capacity, it becomes a burden,"" Lepine said.

The debate on what happens to the buildings is ""never-ending,"" Lepine said. Many religious communities see an opportunity to continue their legacies by maintaining these grand, aging buildings — even as their congregations shrink.

Plan A, he said, is usually to keep the building while seeking out partnerships, especially those connected to the church's traditional missions of health care, education or community organizations.

That could mean leasing space to schools, organizations that serve the vulnerable, or even hospitals, he said.

The Sulpicians, long-time educators of priests, appear to be following that tradition by leasing parts of the Grand Seminaire to schools.

""They announced some time ago that their priority is education, because that's their field,"" Lepine said.

Plan B is generally to transform the building into social or community housing, he said.

""Faith also expresses itself in social causes,"" he said. ""It takes time, but sometimes we can have projects that are good for people.""

As for the seminarians, Lepine said the move isn't really a sad one. Rather, they're going ""back to their beginnings"" by moving closer to the community they serve, he said.

""The Sulpician tradition when they started was in a parish, and the building (was) beside the parish, so it was involved in the life of the people,"" he said. ""So it's going back to that.""

My usual blood pressure is 130/80, and I have never needed treatment. I have no heart disease or family history of heart disease, am not overweight, exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet. The only reason my doctor gave me for recommending Lipitor was that I am over 70. He indicated it was up to me, and gave me the impression that, if it were him, he would probably opt not to take it.

Statin drugs reduce the risk of developing a heart attack. The amount of risk they reduce depends on a person’s baseline risk. Although elevated cholesterol levels and blood pressure are risk factors, being 71 and male is your biggest risk factor. According to validated calculators (one is at cvriskcalculator.com), your risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years is about 19%. Note that your absence of family history, good diet and regular exercise, all important factors, are NOT considered by the calculator, so the 19% is probably an overestimate of the risk in your case.

Treatment with a statin like atorvastatin (Lipitor) would be expected to reduce your risk by 3.5% to 4% over 10 years, to about 15%. Guidelines would clearly recommend a statin drug, such as Lipitor, and most would recommend a high dose, 40 mg or so, rather than the low dose your doctor has suggested.

Guidelines are helpful but not right for everyone. There is not a single decision that is right for everybody, and your preferences really do matter. If you don’t mind taking the medication, it would be a reasonable plan to try it. Most people have no side effects, and the cost for generic atorvastatin is small.

Dear Dr. Roach: I am a 52-year-old woman. I would consider myself in good shape. I do aerobic exercise three to four times a week with weight training. I am 5 feet, 6 inches tall and weigh 119 pounds. I eat a generally healthy diet. I have been noticing that many of my joints crack or crackle (ankles, hips, knees, shoulders, sometimes spine) when I exercise or just with normal activity. Is this normal with aging, or is there something I can do to stop it? Am I doing any joint damage?

A.W.

Cracking joints may be normal, and it’s thought to come from one of two mechanisms. The first is that a tendon can snap over a bony protuberance; the second is that nitrogen bubbles can form under the pressure of moving a joint. Crunching in the joint can be related to debris in the synovial fluid, often seen in arthritis or with damage to the cartilage, such as a torn meniscus in the knee.

One person (thank you, Dr. Donald Unger) did an experiment on himself by cracking the knuckles in only one hand daily for 60 years and found no arthritis in either hand.

An experienced doctor usually can tell the difference between normal and abnormal joints and their noises. An X-ray is occasionally needed.

But I know that he disagrees strongly with all that they believe about U.S. President Donald Trump.

article continues below

It doesn’t matter to them that they’re Canadian-born, live here, and only visit America for periodic golf vacations.

They actually believe what Trump says about COVID-19 being on its way out in the U.S., even as leading scientists there disagree.

My boyfriend, who watches Fox News as well as CNN so he can feel he’s getting at least two sides of every story, says Trump shows all the signs of a wannabe dictator.

He’s sure that, if Trump wins the November election, Canadians will also be negatively affected through punishing trade bans.

Even before the pandemic, my parents described Trump as “refreshing,” and said he has the true values they hold dear.

I can’t believe they’re so hoodwinked by him. I share my boyfriend’s views and believe in his values about democracy, anti-racism and feminism.

I’ve always believed that my parents were good people, self-made financial successes from working-class origins, and devout Catholics. I can’t understand what positive factor they see in Trump.

How do I handle introducing my boyfriend to them, without a catastrophic reaction on either side?

Dangerous Meeting?

Prepare your boyfriend. Tell him first what you love/like about your parents, and the positive side of how their upbringing influenced who you became as an adult.

Then, tell him that your parents are likely to have some lifelong views, based on their strong faith and years of upholding it. It’s not his job as a prospective partner to you, to instantly try to change their minds on hot-button topics such as abortion, gun control, or even on President Trump (especially since you, their daughter, haven’t been able to sway them).

I’m not suggesting that he stay silent upon being introduced. They’ll likely ask him some questions about where he grew up and other background details. Hopefully, they’ll not press him further into areas of huge differences.

At this stage, if you two wish to have a future together, he must stay respectful, despite any opposing views to theirs. However, if they react to him harshly, quickly end this first meeting and leave without responding similarly.

You’re both entitled to choose a partner based on shared values and mutual respect, no longer needing a pat on the head for choosing “the right kind” of mate.

The right one, is the person you can see yourself living with for many years to come.

Feedback regarding the woman whose boyfriend has night terrors and shocked her by using the sink as his toilet:

Reader: “When I first met my husband back in 1968, he too, was an avid sink-pooper. When I first learned about this, I became very angry at him. “I was disgusted with him. But once I found out from his family doctor that he had bathroom-related trauma, I became extremely supportive of his sink-pooping. “He later proposed to me in 1978 and he has continued this habit to this day. We even had a built-in step-stool so that he can still do it, even with his old man bones!”

Ellie: Both women, years apart, wisely sought advice/help for these very unusual situations.

My pregnant, single friend is worrying me with regard to her lack of knowledge/interest about raising a child. Unlike other friends and family who’ve had children, this woman, who’s 32, isn’t reading about the stages of development in the womb, or the best nutrition and self-care an expectant mother should follow to try and give a newborn a healthy start.

I’m not a mother myself so I can’t keep telling her what to do. I feel that I sound negative when I’m asking her questions she can’t answer.

But I’m an aunt and a godmother to several children. What should I say or do without insulting her?

Caring Friend

Buy her the most positive, encouraging, readable book on pregnancy and preparation for baby, that you can find.

Put a bookmark on some of the pages that are upbeat and compelling. Talk to her about it, making positive comments. Stay close after she gives birth… she’ll need your support.

There have been more than 15,000 apparent opioid-related deaths in Canada since 2016.

British Columbia has recorded more than 5,000 deaths from illicit drug overdoses since declaring a public health emergency in 2016.

The study, published on Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, looked at 1,789 overdose deaths in British Columbia between 2015 and 2017 in which the coroner was able to determine the substances relevant to the deaths.

It reported that despite decreases in the prescription of opioids across the province, the death rate from illegal drug overdoses has continued to rise.

Dr. Alexis Crabtree, the study's lead author and resident physician in public health and preventative medicine at the University of British Columbia, says it highlights what isn't working when it comes to tackling the overdose crisis.

""What we found is that this overdose crisis is not driven by prescribed medications and de-prescribing initiatives alone won't solve the overdose crisis,"" she said in an interview.

In most cases where prescribed opioids were implicated in a death, the toxicology report also flagged the non-prescribed opioids in the person's system, Crabtree added.

The study's findings also highlight the declining role of prescription opioids and heroin in the overdose crisis and the rise of synthetic opioids and stimulants.

The current strategies on battling the overdose crisis ""must do much more"" than target de-prescribing opioids, the study concludes.

Men continue to dominate the overdose death toll, making up more than 80 per cent of deaths, with people between the ages of 31 to 49 making up the predominant number of deaths.

One aspect that is often overlooked is the efficacy of methadone and buprenorphine, opioids used to treat opioid addiction, Crabtree said.

The study showed that few overdoses involved people with those opioids in their system, which Crabtree said she believes should make doctors feel more comfortable in prescribing them to drug users.

In B.C., the provincial government expanded the access to a safe supply of prescription drugs near the start of the COVID-19 pandemic due to concerns about the number of overdose deaths arising from isolated drug users.

That program, and subsequent concerns raised over the prescribing of illicit-alternative drugs, prompted the decision to publish the study in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, Crabtree said.

""A question or concern physicians have is 'is the medication I'm prescribing contributing to overdoses?'"" said Crabtree. ""I can understand why people have that concern. I think these results are really reassuring that prescribed medications are not a driver of overdose risks and supports physicians to prescribe under those risk mitigation guidelines.""

She said she agrees with the recommendations of provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry who called for the decriminalization of people who possess small amounts of drugs in a 2019 report.

At the time, Henry wrote that the province ""cannot wait for action at the federal level.""

She reiterated those recommendations in June 2020, which saw 175 suspected overdose-related deaths.

""COVID-19 has made clear the government can act in a very fast and effective way when it prioritizes a response to a public health emergency,"" said Crabtree. ""I would love to see that same effectiveness applied to responding to the overdose emergency and protecting the health of people who use drugs.""

More access to overdose prevention and supervised inhalation sites should be some of the next steps forward both in B.C. and across the country, she added.

The federal government launched a national consultation on supervised-consumption sites last week, seeking comments from a variety of Canadians, including those who operate the sites and those who use them.

If your mood is being dragged down by the pandemic, you'll be uplifted by these three Paralympic athletes — and many others like them — who are profiled in the Nexflix documentary ""Rising Phoenix,"" which will be released in 190 countries on Wednesday.

""In the Paralympic sport, everybody has a story,"" Xavi Gonzalez, the former CEO of the International Paralympic Committee, says in the film. ""It comes from them breaking barriers to be able to achieve what they want to achieve; move on and live life even if all of us may think that you cannot.""

Seen in a private viewing by the Associated Press, the film was to coincide with the opening this week of the Tokyo Paralympic Games. Like the Olympics, it's been postponed until next year by COVID-19.

The documentary weaves the history of the Paralympic Games around the athletes' lives and the financial ups and downs of the movement. It also includes segments about Dr. Ludwig Guttmann, a refugee from Nazi Germany who put together an athletic competition for the disabled in Britain in 1948 as way to help treat World War II veterans with spinal cord injuries.

It also captures what could have been the death knell for the Paralympics just four years ago in Rio de Janeiro when local organizers told Paralympic officials a month before the start that they'd run out of money to run the event. Millions from the Paralympic budget had been taken to pull off the trouble-plagued Olympics.

Only a government bailout saved the Rio Paralympics, and just a few months later Carlos Nuzman, an International Olympic Committee member and head of the organizing committee, was arrested on suspicion of money laundering, tax evasion, and racketeering.

""If it's easy, it's not the Paralympics,"" Gonzalez tells film viewers.

The Italian fencer Vio might be the star: energetic, smiling, dramatic and frank. Or was it the Australian swimmer Cole, who recounts throwing her prosthetic leg at a school bully who called her ""Pirate."" She was not bullied again.

""In the Olympics, all of the bodies look the same,"" Cole says. ""And in the Paralympics, none of the bodies look the same.""

Or Stutzman, known as the ""Armless Archer,"" who grew up wanting to be basketball player Michael Jordan. He deadpans: ""There was no way I was going to be Michael Jordan. No way. I’m not tall enough — right.""

There are also segments with Tatyana McFadden, Jonnie Peacock, Jean-Baptiste Alaize, Cui Zhe, Ryley Batt, and Ntando Mahlangu — all with stories worthy of their own individual film.

And what of the cameo appearances by Prince Harry, who recalled the very successful 2012 Paralympics in London.

""The stadiums were packed,"" the Duke of Sussex said. ""The sport was incredible. ""What they saw was undoubtedly better than the Olympics itself.""

Philip Craven, the former president of the IPC and a one-time Paralympic basketball player, delivered a similar line. He was talking about London being filled with black billboards after the Olympics ended, promoting the Paralympics. They suggested the Olympics were only a ""warmup"" for the Paralympics.

""I’m not sure the Olympics will be very happy with that, but I’ll tell you it touched a spot with me,"" said Craven, who lost the use of his legs as a teenager in a rock-climbing accident.

Then there's the address by the late Stephen Hawking at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Paralympics. Hawking, the theoretical physicist, died in 2018 of motor neuron disease.

""The Paralympic Games is also about transforming our perception of the world,"" Hawking said. ""We are all different. There is no such thing as a standard or run-of-the-mill human being.""

Vio, the Italian fencer, epitomizes the raw and often humorous transparency of the film with athletes talking openly about their tragedies turned to triumph.

""When you see someone you just want to know their story before. Why are they on the wheelchair?"" Vio asks. ""Why are they without arms and legs. There are just funny stories — and other less funny stories.""

Andrew Parsons, the current president of the IPC, told Associated Press in an interview that the film was the brainchild of eventual producer Greg Nugent. Parsons said the result ""is better than I could have imagined.""

""It will change the attitude of whoever watches the movie. That’s for sure,"" Parsons said. ""It is not a movie you can watch and it will not affect you in some way. If we have 1 million people watch the movie, we will have 1 million people that will have a different attitude toward persons with disabilities. If it's 10 million, it will be 10 million. We do believe it can be a game changer because the message is so strong.""

Because you seem so strong and steadfast others will come to you this year for assistance and advice, which you will gladly provide. Do what you can to untangle the knots in their lives but don't do it all — ultimately, they must save themselves.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

You may be in a somewhat critical mood today, the kind of mood where you don't care in the slightest what effects your words have on other people. Just remember that what goes around comes around eventually — and it could be you on the receiving end next.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

Sometimes you take minor disputes way too seriously, and what starts out as a minor disagreement today could quickly escalate into something rather unpleasant. Stand back from the situation and recognize that losing your cool is simply not worth the trouble.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Yes, routine tasks may be boring but they have to be done. If you are as sharp as you think you are it shouldn't be too hard to find ways to enliven your chores. Make a game of what you have to do. Lighten up and have some fun.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

Focus on one thing to the exclusion of everything else today. Send all your energy — physical, mental and emotional — out in a single direction. Once you are locked on to your target there is nothing in this world that can stop you reaching it.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

You may be tempted to do something dramatic today, if only to disrupt the log-jam that has been holding you back. That's fine, but make sure you remain in control at all times — if events take over there's no telling where it might lead.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

You may be practical by nature but you have dreams like everyone else, and one particular dream seems to have taken over 95 per cent of your thinking. Are you prepared to do whatever it takes to turn that dream into a reality? Then go for it!

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

You can be a bit sensitive at times and that's fine, but don't get so touchy over the next few days that you start to distrust everyone around you. You're among friends, mostly, not enemies, so always believe that others wish you well.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

Try not to fly off the handle if a friend or colleague makes a mess of what should have been a simple task. Not everyone possesses your laser-like focus and most likely they have let their mind wander a bit. Guide them back to the right track.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

You are giving others the impression that you are calm and confident when, in fact, your emotions are all over the place. You need to recognize that the longer you continue with this act the bigger the fallout will be. If you need help, ask for it.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

Someone will try to convince you that you need to see a situation from a different angle. Maybe they're right, maybe you do, but it's unlikely to happen until they recognize that your views are every bit as valid as theirs. It may take a while.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

If senior people on the work front get the impression that you are flying too high they may decide to clip your wings. There's nothing wrong with wanting to get ahead in life but it might be smart to play down some of your more outrageous ambitions.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

Follow your instincts and do what feels right to you, even if the whole universe seems to oppose you. More likely than not you are merely being tested to see how resolute you are in following the course you have chosen. You're not the type to give up.

The national project was launched by Roberta Timothy, an assistant professor with the University of Toronto's Institute for Pandemics.

Timothy says many members of the Black and Indigenous communities already avoid interacting with the health-care system mostly due to experiences with racism and biases.

During a global pandemic, Timothy says that can have grave consequences for the well-being of those communities.

""People will seek help when it's an emergency and by then it's too late,"" she says. ""Because of the bias, because of anti-black racism, because of violence they experience, their health becomes more at risk.""

Timothy says there's a need for more data to effectively understand the impact of COVID-19 on racialized communities.

The Ontario government refused to collect race-based data earlier in the pandemic, but it was forced to change course in June. Now it mandates the collection of data around race, income, household size and language when following up with people who've been infected with COVID-19.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Health said the government is engaging with people from racialized communities and other health equity experts regarding the data collection.

""We plan to share findings of this data collection, informed by this engagement,"" David Jensen said in an email.

Jensen said the ministry is concerned about the spread of the virus in ""certain groups of people and in certain neighbourhoods,"" and would welcome additional insights and information about how COVID-19 is affecting racialized communities.

Early data compiled by Toronto Public Health showed that 83 per cent of COVID-19 cases occurred in racialized people. Black people represented 21 per cent of cases in Toronto, but only nine per cent of the city's population.

""There is growing evidence in North America and beyond that racialized people and people living in lower-income households are more likely to be affected by COVID-19,"" said Dr. Christine Navarro, associate medical officer of health for Toronto.

""While the exact reasons for this have yet to be fully understood, we believe it is related to both poverty and racism.""

Timothy's project will collect more data about how Black and Indigenous people interact with the health-care system, but also about economic impacts, evictions, support networks and essential work being done by marginalized communities.

""An underlying part of the project is not only to bring better data, but to support the community in strategizing and finding interventions to find how we get through this,"" said Timothy.

Rudayna Bahubeshi, a Toronto resident and post-graduate student in public policy, says she has first-hand experience with racism in the health-care system. During a stint in a mood disorder ward when she was 18, Bahubeshi said a nurse mistook her for a 30-year-old patient — the only other Black person in the ward at the time — and tried to make her take the other person's medication.

Bahubeshi says she argued but was ignored, and believes her race was a factor in the way she was treated by staff. She says the nurse only realized the mistake when the other patient happened to walk by.

In another hospital visit during the pandemic, Bahubeshi says she was taken to a ""COVID ward"" because she had fever. She says staff would not answer simple questions about whether there were risks involved with using a shared washroom, or about the fact that some staff weren't wearing PPE.

""The way she (the nurse) was engaging with me was very much that I was the problem,"" says Bahubeshi. ""When I talked to a doctor afterwards they told me I was fully in the right and that was unacceptable.""

Bahubeshi says experiences like those erode her trust in the public health system and its ability to provide quality care for her. She says more data about the experience of Black people in health care will be a first step in the right direction.

""The fact that we don't have race-based data is a way we've decided that Black communities are not a priority,"" said Bahubeshi.

Timothy's national project is set to begin in a few months, and will involve surveys and focus groups among Black and Indigenous Canadians.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

You may be feeling a bit unsure of yourself at the moment but that is natural for this time of year. The one thing you must avoid is worrying for no good reason. If you let your imagination play tricks on you they probably won't be ones you enjoy.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

You may be hugely talented but it seems not everyone is aware of your genius. Use your social contacts to get who you are and what you do noticed among a wider range of people. Before you know it your name will be up in lights.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

Resist the urge to change your methods and routines over the next few days. You may feel trapped and unable to make progress but that's just the surface situation. On a deeper level things are beginning to shift, and very soon you'll be speeding ahead again.

Moderation is always a good idea but today it is absolutely essential. With energy planet Mars at odds with Saturn there is a danger you could run smack bang into some kind of wall if you push too hard or move too fast. You're not indestructible Sag.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

Someone in a position of authority will encourage you to take on more responsibility and be more of a leader than a follower, but not everyone will be happy that you seem to be on the way up. Expect negative tactics from rivals and others who envy your success.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

Try not to worry so much about small, unimportant things. One of the skills you were born with is an ability to stand back from what is going on around you and recognize what the bigger picture looks like. You've been neglecting that skill lately.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

But what I remember most vividly is the satay. Threading small, marinated pieces of chicken, meat or fish, or prawns, on bamboo skewers is how satay is made. When you see them cooking on a grill in Singapore at night time, the combination of the sultry tropical air, the orangey light from the charcoal-fuelled flames, the alluring scent of the bamboo and the appearance of the mouth-watering, sizzling satay all combine to make you want to eat them, now.

Just thinking of them again made we want to have some and, with no current plans to visit Singapore, I made my own. You’ll find the recipe below along with one for peanut sauce, for dipping.

Before threading on the marinated chicken, you need to soak the bamboo skewers in water to help prevent them from catching on fire when set on the grill. But even when you do that they still can ignite. That explains why in Singapore you see grills with a long narrow strip of metal about 10 to 15 centimetres wide on one side. When the satay is set on the grill, the meat portion is placed over the fire. The wood portion rests on the fire-insulted strip of metal, preventing the exposed part of the skewer from catching on fire.

As noted in a previous story on satay, to recreate this on my propane barbecue, I set a double thick strip of aluminum foil of similar width on the front portion of my grill. I then heat the grill to medium-high and set the meat portion of the skewer over the flame, and the meatless end on the foil. This technique, along with soaking the skewers in water, should prevent the exposed parts of wood from igniting.

Chicken Satay

Small cubes of chicken, spicily marinated Southeast Asian-style, are threaded on skewers and then grilled until charred, succulent and delicious. Serve the satay as an appetizer, or as a main-course, with rice and stir-fried vegetables.

Preparation time: 40 minutes, plus marinating time

Cooking time: about six minutes

Makes: Four servings (five satay each)

2 Tbsp vegetable oil, plus some for grill

2 Tbsp brown sugar

2 large garlic cloves, minced

1 tsp salt, or to taste

1 tsp finely grated fresh ginger

1 tsp ground coriander 1/2 tsp ground cumin

1/2 tsp ground turmeric

1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper

1 medium lime, finely grated zest and juice of

700 grams (about 10) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into small, about 3/4-inch, cubes 20 bamboo skewers (see Note)

cilantro sprigs or mint sprigs, sliced cucumber and onion, for serving (optional)

• peanut sauce (see recipe below)

Combine the 2 Tbsp vegetable oil, sugar, garlic, salt, ginger, coriander, cumin, turmeric, cayenne and lime zest and juice in bowl large enough to hold the chicken. Add the chicken and turn to coat. Cover chicken and marinate in the refrigerator four hours.

While chicken marinates, soak the skewers in cold water until needed. When chicken has marinated, thread four or five pieces of it on one end of each skewer (see Eric’s options).

Preheat your barbecue or indoor grill to medium high. Lightly oil the bars of the grill. Set on the satay and cook about six minutes, turning occasionally, or until cooked through. Arrange satay on a serving platter and garnish, if desired, with cilantro sprigs (or mint sprigs, cucumber and onion. Serve satay with the peanut sauce, for dipping.

Note: Bamboo skewers are sold at many supermarkets and stores selling kitchenware.

Eric’s options: You can skewer the chicken many hours before cooking the satay. Keep satay refrigerated until ready to grill. Any satay you won’t eat now could be frozen, uncooked. When needed, thaw and grill as directed. Small cubes of beef sirloin, pork leg or lamb leg could be used instead of chicken.

Peanut Sauce

Rich, savoury, peanutty sauce you can dunk the chicken satay in.

Preparation time: Five minutes

Cooking time: a few minutes

Makes: about one cup

1/3 cup peanut butter (see Note 1)

1 (5.6 oz/165 mL) can coconut milk (see Note 2)

1 medium lime, juiced and zested

3 Tbsp soy sauce

1 Tbsp brown sugar

1 Tbsp water

1 tsp finely grated fresh ginger

• pinch ground cayenne pepper

Place the ingredients in a small pot. Set over medium heat, bring to a simmer and whisk until smooth. Simmer two minutes. Serve sauce warm or at room temperature (see Eric’s options).

Note 1: I used local Island Nut Roastery peanut butter when testing this recipe. For more information about it, including stores that sell it, go to their website islandnutroastery.com. I’ve also made this sauce with smooth styles of peanut butter.

Note 2: You’ll find smaller sized cans of coconut milk for sale alongside the larger cans of it at some supermarkets. I you can’t find it, buy a larger can, use a scant 3/4 cup of it for the peanut sauce, and save the rest for another use or freeze it for another time.

Eric’s options: You can make the peanut sauce up to a day before needed. If you do, cool it to room temperature and then cover and refrigerate unto needed. When you do need it, warm it up, until fluid again. Thin sauce with a little more water, if you find it thick.

After making it, I pondered what to serve with it, leafed through my Italian cookbooks for inspiration and opted to make suppli al telefono.

Suppli are similar to Sicilian-style arancini; orange-shaped (arancia is the Italian word for orange) balls of crumb-coated risotto rice fried until golden. Suppli, though, are egg-shaped, Roman-style rice croquettes stuffed with mozzarella cheese.

article continues below

When you pull the cooked suppli apart, the strands of melted cheese in the middle resemble old-fashioned telephone wires. It’s why this dish is playfully called “suppli al telefono.”

Suppli are delicious and went very well with my summer tomato sauce. But they do take a bit of time to make and my step-by-step photos will guide you.

You can serve the suppli as an appetizer or as a main-course, with a side salad or grilled summer vegetables.

Suppli al Telefono

Italian-style rice croquettes, stuffed with cheese and basil, coated in breadcrumbs, then fried until golden and very delicious.

Preparation time: 60 minutes

Cooking time: about 50 minutes

Makes: 16 suppli

4 1/3 cups chicken or vegetable stock, plus more if needed

2 Tbsp olive oil

2 cups risotto rice (see Note)

1/2 medium onion, finely diced

1 large garlic clove, minced

2/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

2 large eggs, beaten

• salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

16 medium fresh basil leaves

16 (3/4-inch square) mozzarella cheese (about 125 to 150 grams)

3/4 cup dried breadcrumbs

• vegetable oil, for frying

• warm tomato sauce, to taste (see recipe below and Eric’s options)

Place stock in a pot and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. When simmering, turn heat to it’s lowest setting.

Heat olive oil in a second pot set over medium, medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook and stir until tender, about five minutes. Add rice and garlic and cook and stir two minutes more.

Pour in 1 cup of the stock, lowering the heat as needed so that it very gently simmers.

Simmer until that stock is almost fully absorbed by the rice. Slowly add remaining stock in 1/3-cup increments, cooking and stirring until it’s almost fully absorbed by the rice before adding the next 1/3-cup. It should take about 20 minutes to use up all the stock and at that point the rice should look thick and creamy and just be tender (al dente), with a tiny bit of firmness when bitten into.

Remove rice from the heat and stir in Parmesan cheese. Spread rice out on a baking sheet and cool to room temperature. Thoroughly mix the beaten eggs into the rice and season with salt and pepper.

Line a second baking sheet with parchment paper. Put the breadcrumbs into a shallow bowl.

To make suppli, divide the rice into 16 portions, each about 1/3 cup. Dampen your hands with cold water, lift up a portion of the rice and set a basil leaf and piece of cheese in the centre of it. Shape rice into an egg-shaped ball, ensuring the cheese and basil is completely encased by the rice. Fill and form the remaining portions of rice into suppli as you did the first one. When you do, occasionally dampen your hands with water again to help prevent the rice from sticking.

Coat suppli in breadcrumbs and set on the parchment paper-lined baking sheet (see Eric’s options).

Pour three inches of vegetable oil into a deep pot (see Eric’s options). Set over medium-high heat and warm oil to 350 F, or until a small cube of bread fries gold brown in about 15 seconds when dropped into the oil.

Preheat oven to 200 F. Working in batches of three or four, fry the suppli about three and a half to four minutes, until rich golden brown and hot in the centre. Drain on paper towel and set the cooked suppli on a clean baking sheet and keep warm in the oven while you fry the rest. Serve the suppli with tomato sauce.

Note: Rice for risotto is sold at most supermarkets. Bags of it are sometimes simply labeled “risotto rice” or “Italian rice.” You’ll also find specific varieties of rice that are good for risotto, such as arborio, carnaroli or vialone nano.

Eric options: You can make the suppli many hours in advance. Cover and refrigerate until ready to fry. The suppli can also be frozen. If you do that, thaw them before frying.

The suppli could also be fried in a deep fryer. If you don’t want make your own tomato sauce, serve the suppli with a store-bought one, such as passata di pomodoro (strained tomatoes).

Summer Tomato Sauce with Basil

In-season, ripe, red tomatoes cooked and then blended into a sauce you can serve with suppli al telefono and other Italian-style dishes, such as pasta. It yields more sauce than you’ll need for the suppli, but the leftover sauce, once cooled, will freeze well.

Preparation time: 25 minutes

Cooking time: About 20 minutes

Makes: About 3 1/2 to 4 cups

2 1/2 lbs. ripe red tomatoes (see Note 1)

2 Tbsp olive oil

1/2 medium onion, diced

• pinch or 2 fennel seeds, coarsely crushed (optional; see Note 2)

• pinch red pepper flakes

16 medium fresh basil leaves, or to taste

• salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cut stem end out of each tomato; mark a shallow X at the top of the blossom end. Plunge tomatoes, a few at a time, into the boiling water for 60 seconds, or until the skins start to loosen. Use a slotted spoon to lift tomatoes out of the water, set on a wide plate and cool a few minutes, until safe enough to handle.

Pull the skins off the tomatoes. Cut each tomato in half. Set a fine sieve over a bowl. Squeeze or pull out the seeds from each tomato half into the sieve. Use a whisk to push out as much liquid as you can from the tomato seed mixture. Compost the seeds and skins.

Set the seeded tomato halves on a large cutting board and coarsely chop. Set the chopped tomatoes and the juices on the board in the bowl with the strained tomato seed liquid in it.

Heat oil in a medium pot set over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until tender, about five minutes.

Add the chopped tomatoes to the pot. Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the tomatoes are very tender and falling apart, about 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in the basil.

Purée the tomato sauce in the pot with an immersion (hand) blender. The puréeing could also be done in a food processor or blender. Taste and season the tomato sauce with salt and pepper and it’s ready.

Note 1: Ripe, deep red tomatoes good for making sauce include an heirloom variety called oxheart, beefsteak tomatoes, ultra sweet tomatoes and/or roma (plum) tomatoes.

Note 2: You can coarsely crush the fennel seeds in a spice grinder, or by placing them in a thick plastic bag and hitting them with a kitchen hammer.

PS

The “sinus” in sinus bradycardia has nothing to do with your nose. It refers to a cavity that exists embryologically that becomes part of the wall of the right atrium.

The natural pacemaker of the heart is contained there, and is called the “sinus node” or “sinoatrial node.” “Bradycardia” is from the Greek words meaning “slow heart” and is a common condition that only occasionally becomes a problem. Bradycardia is having less than 60 beats per minute, and sinus rhythm means the impulse is coming from the usual place.

Trained athletes often have slow heart rates; occasionally, some diseases — especially Lyme disease, hypothyroidism and sleep apnea — can cause sinus bradycardia.

Many medications, especially beta blockers, can cause a slow heart rate. However, in the elderly, slow heart rates can be an early sign that the cells in the sinus node aren’t working as well as they used to. One cardiologist where I trained called them “grey hairs in the heart.”

Sinus bradycardia needs to be treated when it is causing symptoms, and a cardiologist with special training in rhythm disorders, called an electrophysiologist, is the best referral when the slow heart is not due to other causes.

Patients with extreme bradycardia (below 40) would also rate a referral, even if they don’t report symptoms, as many will note improvement with treatment. The most common treatment is a permanent pacemaker.

Dear Dr. Roach: I was recently diagnosed with low-grade prostate cancer. For now, my urologist recommends simply monitoring the situation closely through PSA testing and another biopsy in a year; no surgery, radiation or chemo at this time. I’m not on any medication. I recently asked my doctor if I could donate blood and he did not see a reason I could not. However, when I tried to set up an appointment at the blood bank, I was turned down due to my cancer diagnosis. When asked, the blood bank representative could offer no other reason nor could he explain the risk. I can understand the need for caution at the blood bank, but was wondering if there was any medical evidence of transmitting cancer or other diseases through blood transfusions where the blood originated from an individual with cancer, such as myself. I would guess that there have been cases where people with undiagnosed cancer have donated blood and am very curious about the risks.

M.R.

There has never been a confirmed case of cancer transmitted by blood transfusion.

Cancer can be transmitted by organ transplant, and in theory, blood cancers such as leukemia might be transmitted to a person with a weakened immune system. Solid cancers — such as prostate, breast, lung and colon — would not be expected to transmit cancer, so the observation that they have not is unsurprising.

Blood banks are understandably very conservative when accepting blood. They want for the blood not only to be safe, but also to appear safe. That can lead them to make decisions that seem illogical. However, taking blood donations from a person with active cancer may also be unwise from the standpoint of the donor: You might need your blood to best deal with your own cancer, even though it sounds like in your case, your prostate cancer is very low risk.

For many years, I have been told that because of poliomyelitis I cannot tolerate any preventive inoculations, including flu, pneumonia, shingles, etc. I was allowed to get flu shots when they first became available; however, when additives were included later on, I was instructed not to get it any longer. My concern is if I will be able to safely partake of the coronavirus inoculation when it becomes available. Most present-day doctors have no experience with polio, and often input is vague.

P.G.

article continues below

Poliomyelitis was, for many years, a terror that parents feared every summer. Until a vaccine became available in 1955, polio could strike without warning. Although the vast majority of people had only mild symptoms (90% to 95% of cases were asymptomatic), about one person per thousand with polio developed poliomyelitis, a serious complication of the nervous system that was sometimes fatal and two-thirds of the time led to permanent weakness. Why some people got terribly ill and died while others had no symptoms remains a mystery, although we know some risk factors for developing poliomyelitis, such as older age, excess exercise while infected and tonsillectomy.

I am surprised to hear the recommendations against standard vaccines for you. I haven’t read that before and I have taken care of quite a few polio survivors. Experts confirm that standard vaccines, including flu, pneumonia and shingles, are recommended for those with a history of poliomyelitis. There are no additives in the vaccines placing polio survivors at increased risk.

It is too early to speculate on a coronavirus vaccine. Although many groups are working on a vaccine, efficacy and safety testing is extensive before a vaccine is approved and the process must not be rushed. However, I doubt that a history of polio will prevent you or the many other polio survivors from getting the vaccine when one is approved.

There are many places for you to get more information: Post-polio.org is one I often use. It has reliable information from experts, which is increasingly important as the number of physicians who have taken care of polio survivors decreases.

Dear Dr. Roach: Will you please explain how a person who is not sick, or has no symptoms, tests positive for COVID-19? How do doctors know he has it? The symptoms they tell us are the same symptoms we knew made us sick when we were young. Our mother put us to bed, gave us some medicine, and we were good to go in a couple of days. Don’t we carry a lot of germs?

L.J.T.

The majority of COVID-19 infections have minimal or no symptoms.

People without symptoms could be tested due to concerns about exposure or as part of a program to identify the prevalence in the population. The test is specific for the genetic material of the virus.

It is true that for many people, the symptoms are similar to the common cold or another of the many germs (bacteria and viruses) we are exposed to.

However, some people get terribly ill due to COVID-19. As of this writing, there have been more than half a million deaths worldwide, and will be higher still when this is published.

As in the above answer, why some people get ill and die while others have no symptoms is a mystery, although we know some risk factors for becoming seriously ill, such as older age, being male and a history of high blood pressure or diabetes.

She has been seen by her general doctor and gynecologist, but so far, no one has been able to diagnose her.

article continues below

She has used estrogen cream, and does Kegel exercises and while the pain goes away, it always comes back.

I read that there’s some kind of surgery and would like to hear more about that.

S.F.

Vulvodynia has a significant effect on a woman’s quality of life. While it sounds like she has had some appropriate evaluation and attempts at treatment, she continues to have symptoms. This is the case for many women.

Patients with vulvodynia should see a specialist in female pelvic pain, usually a gynecologist who has special expertise in this problem. Most often, a number of interventions are begun, including: careful advice on proper hygiene, especially avoiding soaps, douches and other irritants to the vulva; wearing cotton underwear; practising stress reduction; getting regular non-irritating exercise; and the use of warm soaks and/or ice packs. Another important resource is a pelvic floor physical therapist. Some of my patients have had an improvement in symptoms with cognitive behavioral therapy.

Although there are surgical approaches to vulvodynia, they are reserved for women with certain types of pain who continue to have pain despite conservative management.

There is preliminary evidence that laser-based treatments may have benefit in some women with vulvodynia.

I would strongly recommend your sister ask for a referral to an expert in female pelvic pain.

Dear Dr. Roach: My friend had the coronavirus in April. She tested positive. Her symptoms were no taste or smell and feeling very sluggish. She has recovered but her sense of smell and taste have not come back. She went to an ENT and was given a CT scan of her sinuses, which showed nothing wrong. She was put on a steroid pack and Flonase twice a day. Ten days have passed with no improvement. Will she fully recover?

K.F.G.

Although many viral infections can cause loss of taste and smell, this has been a particularly common symptom in coronavirus (30% to 80%). In every case I have seen, it has come back, although the loss can be prolonged for weeks or months. This is a new disease, and it hasn’t been long enough for us to see whether there will be a few cases that are permanent. So far, it looks promising that the sense of taste and smell will come back in most cases.

Transport Canada data obtained by The Canadian Press this week shows 75 per cent of the $300-million program has already been spoken for, just 15 months into its three-year mandate.

The rebate, which provides up to $5,000 back on the purchase or lease of a new battery vehicle, or a battery-gasoline hybrid one, began May 1, 2019, and was supposed to run until April 30, 2022.

But as of July 31, more than $225 million had been paid out to 53,510 drivers.

""It's no surprise to me,"" said Daniel Breton, president of Electric Mobility Canada, a non-profit agency pushing for the electrification of transportation.

Electric car sales, as a share of overall vehicle purchases, have steadily grown from two per cent of all sales in 2018 to three per cent last year, and to almost four per cent in the first three months of 2020.

But the rate of uptake is heavily concentrated in just three provinces. Quebec and British Columbia, which have sales quotas for electric cars and provincial rebates on top of the federal one, together account for 86 per cent of all the rebates.

Ontario, which had a provincial rebate until 2019, accounted for another 12 per cent, with the remaining two per cent divided among the other seven provinces and the territories.

Breton said the additional provincial rebate makes buying electric cars more attractive in Quebec and B.C. but car makers are also shipping more electric cars there because their dealers have quotas for sales. Availability of electric models is limited, and many drivers have to wait weeks or months for one.

Electric Mobility Canada wants Ottawa to expand the program to include used cars and to increase the maximum purchase price of the cars that qualify for a rebate. SUVs and pickup trucks, which are more expensive, are set to come onto the market. In 2019, almost three in every four passenger vehicles sold were SUVs and pickups.

Cara Clairman, CEO of the non-profit advocacy group Plug'n Drive, says she hopes Ottawa will provide more money for rebates when the current allotment runs out because they are making a difference.

""I think we do need a few more years of it,"" she said. ""You have to look at it as a climate-change program.""

Canada has set targets to have 10 per cent of all passenger vehicles sold be electric by 2025, 30 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2040. Breton said that won't happen if the rebate isn't expanded.

Breton is also looking for the rebates to be extended to used electric and hybrid vehicles, which are now more easy to find than new ones in many cases. A 10-per-cent rebate on the purchase of a used electric car was mentioned in the mandate letter for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains last fall but has not yet been announced.

Transport Minister Marc Garneau was instructed in his mandate letter to do more to make the electric car sales quotas. Before the pandemic, he indicated he was looking at what more to do, including extending or expanding the rebate program. Something was expected in the March federal budget, delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Garneau's spokeswoman was noncommittal Thursday when asked if the rebate program would be expanded.

""This specific program continues and consumers are able to make use of the incentive,"" Livia Belcea said in an email. ""Any changes in funding for the program would be reviewed at the appropriate time and as needed.""

The lengthy report from the Special Investigations Unit notes that Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked ""important conversations"" about the ways in which police interact with Black and Indigenous people, but says there was no evidence of police wrongdoing or ""overt"" racism in the incident itself.

article continues below

Director Joseph Martino said race may have been a factor in the events leading up to the death of the 29-year-old, who was both Indigenous and Black, but that examining systemic issues in policing is not his role.

""The task before me was a narrow one — namely, to determine whether there were reasonable grounds, on the evidence collected by the SIU, to believe that any one or more of the officers who responded to Ms. Korchinski-Paquet's apartment committed a criminal offence in connection with her death,"" he wrote.

The Special Investigations Unit said six officers were in the 29-year-old woman's Toronto home when she fell from the balcony in May, while her mother and brother were nearby.

The agency's report says Korchinski-Paquet's mother called police to the home because the two siblings were fighting — ""bottles and punches had been thrown"" — and she wanted both of them removed from the apartment.

It says Korchinski-Paquet and her brother also called 911 during the argument, which began as a dispute over the volume of the TV.

When the 911 operator asked about any mental health issues, the report says, the family indicated that Korchinski-Paquet had epilepsy and had had seizures earlier in the day.

It says that after police arrived, two officers blocked Korchinski-Paquet from getting to her mother and brother before allowing her back into the apartment so she could use the bathroom.

She then went out onto the 24th-floor balcony and prevented officers from joining her by holding her body against the door.

""Very quickly, Ms. Korchinski-Paquet scaled the balcony railing and the (subject officer) lost sight of her,"" the report reads.

She then tried to scale the balcony and cross onto the adjoining one, which is when she lost her balance and fell to her death, the report reads.

The agency said no officers were on the balcony with Korchinski-Paquet at the time, and there's no evidence the officers committed a crime.

Martino said that the officers seemed to be confused about whether epilepsy was a mental health condition and if they should or could detain Korchinski-Paquet under the Mental Health Act.

""The limited layperson's research I have conducted of the matter suggests that epilepsy is a neurological disorder with manifestations that can be mental as well as physical,"" Martino wrote. ""Be that as it may, I cannot fault the officers for failing to take Ms. Korchinski-Paquet into custody prior to her scaling the balcony railing. She had not given them any indication that she wished to harm herself and was professing to be the victim of an assault at the hands of her brother.""

He also said the officers tried to de-escalate the situation between Korchinski-Paquet's family.

The decision comes after the arm's-length agency interviewed all six officers, along with 15 civilian witnesses.

The agency said investigators also received a written statement from Korchinski-Paquet's father, with whom she had been speaking on the phone moments before her death.

Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked protests in the city and calls to change the way police deal with people experiencing mental health crises.

Martino noted that Korchinski-Paquet died just days after George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, was killed when an officer pressed a knee against his neck for nearly nine minutes, at a time when there was increased scrutiny over the relationship between police and racialized people.

In Toronto, thousands of protesters took to the streets on May 30, three days after the incident in Korchinski-Paquet's apartment. Several smaller marches followed it over the next several weeks.

Two city counsellors then brought forward a motion to defund Toronto police, but it was struck down in favour of introducing body-worn cameras to the force.

The Toronto Police Services Board, the body that oversees the force, then launched a series of town halls to discuss systemic racism in policing, though many protesters said such information-gathering had been done before to little effect.

Toronto police and Korchinski-Paquet’s family were expected to comment on the SIU report at separate news conferences later Wednesday.

Other speakers tonight include senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, who is leaving the White House at the end of the month, and Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn.

A devout Catholic, Pence and wife Karen are expected to carry the evangelical banner into Day 3 of the convention, touting Trump as the best choice for Americans who consider themselves social conservatives.

Democrats seized on the opportunity, deploying the openly gay Pete Buttigieg, one of Joe Biden's former presidential rivals, in a fundraising missive denouncing Pence's ""divisive, anti-LGBTQ politics"" and ""archaic worldview.""

As head of the White House coronavirus force, Pence is also likely to address an issue that has so far received relatively scant attention from convention speakers: the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Tuesday, economic adviser Larry Kudlow spoke of the crisis in the past tense, even though the pandemic continues to rage across the U.S., while only first lady Melania Trump expressed any empathy for the more than 178,000 Americans killed by the virus to date.

""My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one, and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering,"" she said. ""I know many people are anxious, and some feel helpless. I want you to know you are not alone.""

Kudlow, meanwhile, framed the novel coronavirus as ancient history in the U.S.

""It was awful — health and economic impacts were tragic, hardship and heartbreak were everywhere,"" Kudlow said. ""But presidential leadership came swiftly and effectively, with an extraordinary rescue for health and safety to successfully fight the COVID virus.""

Of the racial unrest roiling the country — fuelled this week by another police shooting of an unarmed Black man, this time in Wisconsin — Melania Trump urged protesters to channel their furious energy into positive change, not wanton destruction. She also resisted the urge to ""divide the country further"" by beating up on Democrats.

But she raised eyebrows by framing her husband, notorious for playing fast and loose with the truth, as an honest and authentic human being.

""Total honesty is what we as citizens deserve from our president,"" she said. ""Whether you like it or not, you always know what he's thinking.""

Trump has been putting the power of the presidency under a brazen partisan spotlight, and did so again Tuesday, pardoning a convicted bank robber who now helps prisoners reintegrate into society and presiding over a naturalization ceremony for five new American citizens. His wife's speech was delivered from the White House Rose Garden.

And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's pre-taped speech from a Jerusalem rooftop, coming in the middle of a diplomatic mission, did not escape the attention of some members of Congress. Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is accusing Pompeo of violating federal law by mixing government business with partisan interests.

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""","INVERMAY, Sask. — People could always tell when Aaron Ogden entered a room.

The 19-year-old had a big presence, said his father, Mark Ogden. He was a prankster, a one-of-a-kind character who would sit and talk to anybody as if he'd known them for years.

article continues below

""He wasn't afraid to make friends,"" Ogden, 50, said in a phone interview. ""This is just the way he was.

""Really easy to talk to.""

People remembered the young man's outgoing personality at his funeral this week. He died in a Calgary hospital last Saturday after collapsing on a run.

His father, a trucker, was able to be by his son's side.

He said a major blood clot had formed around a stent placed in his son's aorta. The stent was necessary after he survived a serious highway accident on his way to work last year.

""It was a miracle, really.""

Ogden said while in hospital before his death, his son told him he was supposed to go for a CT scan in June while still living in Saskatchewan near Yorkton.

It was a routine checkup on the stent, but the appointment was postponed because of restrictions around the COVID-19 pandemic and never rescheduled.

""I didn't think nothing of it at the time, but I mulled it over ... as we watched him decline,"" Ogden said.

""It hit me. He was trying to tell me: 'This shouldn't have happened.'""

The father believes that had his son's scan not been cancelled, doctors might have found the blood clot in time.

Ogden wants all postponed hospital procedures done immediately.

""People's lives are being lost,"" he said. ""These COVID rules are way too far.""

Ogden believes the Saskatchewan Health Authority bears responsibility for his son's death.

""Somebody needs to be held to account.""

The health authority halted hundreds of non-urgent surgeries, procedures and diagnostics in March to brace for the pandemic.

Two months later, when the government felt it had a handle on the spread of the novel coronavirus, it announced the resumption of health services would be staggered.

""Emergency and urgent patients are the priority for services, including diagnostic imaging,"" said Corey Miller, vice-president of provincial programs at the health authority.

""The determination of the priority is based on the evaluation of the referring physician in consultation with the patient.""

Miller said they are reviewing Ogden's case and have reached out to his family.

He said the health authority is working through the backlog of exams that were delayed during the first few months of the pandemic.

More than 1,500 CT appointments which had been booked were postponed, he said.

Ogden questions why something like a CT scan couldn't be performed in Yorkton, where the risk of COVID-19 was low.

As of Friday, health officials reported five active cases in the region, which has only seen 33 infections in total since the pandemic hit Saskatchewan.

Cheryl Camillo, a professor with the University of Regina's Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy, says speaking generally, delaying non-essential services to respond to COVID-19 was the responsible thing to do because the virus was new and spreading quickly.

""The risks are that some people don't get the essential and urgent services because so much of the workforce and the resources of the health system move towards responding to COVID,"" said the health systems researcher.

""It's very human for people to get frustrated because health care is something that is so personal.""

She says another risk of scaling back is that people can lose confidence in a health system some may perceive as having overplanned for the pandemic.

Health officials are in the tough spot of having to prepare for the worst case scenario and what could be a rapid change in case numbers, she says.

During the pandemic Camillo's own grandmother died in a long-term care home in the United States from isolation and depression, she says.

""I suffered an individual loss of my otherwise pretty healthy grandmother, but despite how profoundly sad that makes me, I understand and would defend the care home's decision to lock down.

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""

Loblaw Companies Ltd., which began offering COVID-19 testing for patients at a handful of its Alberta pharmacy locations in June, plans to expand the program to all 234 of its pharmacies in the province by Sept. 1.

article continues below

The company says it has reached out to all 10 provinces to discuss in-store testing outside Alberta, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford this week acknowledging the possibility.

The swab tests are only for those with no symptoms or any known contact with coronavirus patients and may be useful for teachers returning to school or Canadians who take care of an older family member, said Theresa Firestone, head of health and wellness at Shoppers Drug Mart. Loblaw-owned pharmacy locations include Shoppers stores as well as Independent Foods and No Frills.

""It's very convenient. We're in every community. The other plus is they don't have to line up with people who may have symptoms. We've shared that with Ontario and with other provinces, so at this point we’re looking forward to what they may decide,"" Firestone said.

London Drugs also conducts COVID-19 tests in Alberta. It began offering the service at six locations during the past two weeks and plans to roll it out at nine more by October. Like Shoppers, it bills Alberta Health Services for testing costs.

The service builds on other responses to the pandemic such as online pharmacist consultations and a pilot program where patients consult virtually with doctors in a private room in the store.

London Drugs is among the pharmacy retailers beefing up their role in a health-care system grappling with an aging population.

""With the extended hours of operation, you can basically go in when our stores are open and be able to find a pharmacist to ask a question. So what we’re able to do at that point is basically help triage the system,"" said Chris Chiew, head of pharmacy at the Richmond, B.C.-based retailer.

London Drugs has also hired diabetes educators to test blood sugar levels and assist patients with weight management and diet.

Shoppers has stepped even further into the realm of physicians, opening one of three planned medical clinics with doctors who cater to a roster of patients and walk-in services.

""There are a number of Canadians who don’t have access to a family physician. And we thought there was an opportunity for us to really play a role here in terms of access,"" Firestone said.

Drugstores can also handle the bureaucratic side of health care, freeing up doctors to spend more time with patients, she said.

""Looking for PPE (personal protective equipment), sorting out their waiting rooms so that people are socially distanced, managing virtual care...we’re able to take that burden on for them,"" Firestone said.

In 2018, Shoppers launched its Wellwise store chain to sell assisted-living devices aimed at older Canadians. More recently, it began to offer tips and videos online designed to help ward off depression and anxiety.

Metro Inc. declined to comment on any attempts to provide COVID-19 testing. The bulk of the company's Jean Coutu drugstores are located in Quebec, which unlike some provinces does not allow pharmacists to conduct testing via nose and mouth swabs.

""We know that structural damage has been done to the economy. It's going to require a lot of quarters of clean up from here, but we do view this quarter's PCL as our high-water mark,"" Daniel Moore, the bank's chief risk officer, said during a conference call with financial analysts.

Bank of Montreal (TSX:BMO). Up $4.38 cents, or 5.7 per cent, to $81.23. BMO Financial Group put aside a hefty amount of money again to protect itself from bad loans even as it posted a $1.23-billion profit in its latest quarter. The Toronto-based bank said Tuesday that provisions for credit losses amounted to $1.05 billion in its third quarter, up from $306 million last year and down from $1.11 billion last quarter. Patrick Cronin, the bank's chief risk officer, attributed the high provisions to the COVID-19 pandemic, but said he has confidence in the bank's ability to operate in such an environment.

The Canadian Association of Broadcasters issued a report on Wednesday warning of potential closures and widespread job cuts as private TV and radio broadcasters face a cumulative projected revenue shortfall of up to $1.06 billion by the end of 2022.

Most vulnerable are the country's AM radio stations, the report said, as well as other independent private radio and TV operations in smaller markets across the country.

The study, titled ""The Crisis in Canadian Media and the Future of Local Broadcasting,"" was commissioned by the CAB, which represents the majority of private broadcasters in Canada, and conducted through Winnipeg-based independent media economics consultancy Communications Management Inc.

The CAB says it's concerned about the fallout from a substantial erosion in local advertising revenues over recent months.

Radio stations may be hardest hit in the short term, the report suggests, partly due to many advertisers pulling back on their spending in the pandemic and hastening a decline in the media industry's revenues.

Private radio ad revenues are expected to be $383 million below last year, it said.

The report's projections suggest that without further government support those declines could mean as many as 50 private local radio stations go out of business over the next four to six months.

Another 150 radio stations could topple in the 18 months that follow, it said, leading to as many as 2,000 job losses.

The CAB is calling on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to take swift action by establishing a ""more fair and sustainable future"" for local media.

Last month, the organization sent an emergency application to the CRTC requesting permission for broadcasters to be relieved of certain terms of their agreements, such as spending requirements on Canadian programming, for the broadcast year that ends Aug. 31.

Lenore Gibson, chair of the CAB, said broadcasters have ""done their utmost to cut expenses"" in areas such as administration, and ""the last thing that they want to do is cut into programming costs, but that's the only area that's left now.""

The CAB is urging the federal government to provide emergency regulatory relief as well as greater ""targeted support"" for the industry starting this fall.

Without greater financial measures in place, the CAB says the effects could leave many communities with only national and international media organizations to provide them with most of their news, effectively eliminating most community coverage of local politics, health and education in some regions of the country.

Bo Horvat scored twice, and Tyler Toffoli and Elias Pettersson each had a goal and two assists as the Canucks defeated the Golden Knights 5-2 at Rogers Place.

The best-of-seven second-round series is tied 1-1. Game 3 goes Thursday.

Forty-eight hours earlier, the Golden Knights, now 8-2 in the post-season, had manhandled the Canucks en route to a 5-0 pounding in Game 1.

""For us as a team we wanted to bounce back from Game 1. We weren't happy with that,"" said Pettersson.

""We played a good game. We should be happy about it but (we need) a short-term memory and be ready for Game 3.""

Goaltender Jacob Markstrom made 38 saves for the win while Robin Lehner stopped 22 shots for Vegas. It's the first time Vegas has allowed more than five goals in a game in the return-to-play tournament.

It was the first game back for Toffoli since the opening game of the qualifying round against the Minnesota Wild on Aug. 2. The NHL is not releasing information on injuries, but Toffoli had been seen in a walking boot.

Toffoli jumped over the boards for his first shift in the first period and scored nine seconds later, taking a cross-crease pass from Pettersson to put the puck into a yawning net. He then made it 2-0 on the power play, delivering a tape-to-tape pass to an incoming Horvat, who blasted it past Lehner.

""It's fun to get back in the lineup and get a big win and tie this series up,"" said Toffoli, who had been acquired at the trade deadline from the Los Angeles Kings. He had put up 10 points in his first 10 games with the Canucks before the regular season ended March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I made some phone calls yesterday, talked to a lot of people. It was a busy day,"" said Toffoli. ""It was good obviously getting the OK from everybody (to play). I got all excited. Felt like I was coming back to my first playoff series.""

Vancouver coach Travis Green said the 5-0 loss was their worst game of the playoffs and that Game 2 was a must-win.

""You go down two (games) against that team early in the series it would be tough and just mentally, too (to come back),"" he said.

""We were better with the puck, played a more direct game. I thought we were better on our feet, quicker. That's a good hockey team. I thought we did a good job of making them defend more than we did the first game.""

Despite being down by two goals in the second period, the Golden Knights looked like they were going to run the Canucks out of the rink again.

Markstrom kept the Canucks alive as Vegas tilted the ice and turned his net into a shooting gallery, blasting away for 22 shots in the period. Vegas got one goal back from Alex Tuch before Pettersson scored on a cross-ice feed from Alex Edler to make it 3-1 heading into the third.

""That really was a back-breaker,"" said Vegas head coach Peter DeBoer. ""You're down 3-1 and you have nothing to show for the work you put in to try and get back in the game.""

Tuch added: ""We knew Vancouver wasn't happy with the way they played last game and we knew they were going to come out flying. And we decided instead of being prepared, (to) be surprised by that for some reason.""

Vancouver iced the game 18 seconds into the third on Horvat's second goal. Then the frustration finally got to Vegas.

First, Max Pacioretty grabbed J.T. Miller by the head and threw him down after the whistle for a roughing penalty. Tuch got a double minor for pummelling Jake Virtanen while the Vancouver forward lay on the ice.

Pacioretty scored late for Vegas and Tanner Pearson added the final Vancouver goal into an empty net.

Horvat had not found the scoresheet since scoring two goals in each of the first two games against the St. Louis Blues in the first round.

Pettersson has been a steady point-getter throughout the playoffs but had been shut down by Vegas in Game 1, limited to no shots on net and one blocked shot.

Markstrom, in his first playoff series, has been the locomotive pulling the Canucks' playoff train. He allowed just nine goals on 121 shots (.926 save percentage) against Minnesota in the first round while registering his first playoff shutout. He saved 29 of 34 against the Blues (.930).

The series is being played at a fan-less Rogers Place. Players are isolating between contests to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This was Williams’ fifth match since professional tennis resumed amid the coronavirus pandemic after a hiatus of nearly six months — and all five have gone three sets. She is 3-2 in that stretch.

The result against No. 13 seed Sakkari, and particularly the way the match ended, was hardly promising for Williams as the U.S. Open’s start approaches next week.

The Western & Southern Open is usually held in Ohio but was moved to the U.S. Open’s site in Flushing Meadows this year to make for a two-event, no-spectator ""bubble"" during the pandemic.

In men's play, Canada's Milos Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Andy Murray. Raonic, from Thornhill, Ont., is the last Canadian remaining in the draw.

Williams was seemingly in control early, serving for the first set at 5-3, 30-0, when things began to unravel. She missed two backhands in a row, then put a forehand into the net to set up a break point, and walked over to the stand holding her towel at the back of the court (the ball people normally handle towels for players, but not during COVID-19).

That’s when chair umpire Aurelie Tourte called a time violation. On the following point, Williams sailed a forehand long to get broken.

At the ensuing changeover, the 23-time Grand Slam champion argued with Tourte, saying: ""I mean, I’m getting my own towels. That’s not fair. You should tell me on the sidelines next time if I need to play faster. Believe me, I will. ... You didn't even give me a warning.""

While Williams eventually did grab that set, she again frittered away a 5-3 lead in the second, plus a 4-1 edge in the tiebreaker. When she sat after the second set, the 38-year-old American tossed her racket over her shoulder the way an office worker might flip a crumpled piece of paper toward a trash can.

Williams came out flat in the third set, as if she’d rather be anywhere else. She double-faulted four times in the second game, including on Sakkari’s eighth break chance, to make it 2-0 and that was pretty much that.

Hours earlier, Novak Djokovic’s neck felt much better, and his tennis looked much better, in a 6-2, 6-4 victory over unseeded American Tennys Sandgren that improved the No. 1-ranked man to 20-0 in 2020.

""Actually, I’m pleasantly surprised with the way I recovered and felt today — just overall, physically, but also with the neck, specifically, because that was a little bit of a concern,"" said Djokovic, who will be eyeing his 18th Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open. ""Going back four, five days, I did struggle quite a lot.""

Djokovic was treated by a trainer and played sluggishly in his opening match Monday, but he was at his best from the outset against Sandgren and saved all four break points he faced.

Djokovic will face 34th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff in the quarterfinals. The other quarterfinal in the top half of the draw will be defending champion Daniil Medvedev against No. 8 seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Reilly Opelka, a 6-foot-11 American who is ranked 39th, delivered 19 aces and knocked off 2019 U.S. Open semifinalist Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 7-6 (4). Opelka next meets No. 4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, whose 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4) win over No. 16 John Isner was interrupted by a rain delay of nearly 1 1/2 hours late in the first set.

Also interrupted by the weather was Raonic's victory over the three-time Grand Slam champion. Raonic, a Wimbledon runner-up in 2016, has held all 29 games he’s served so far in the tournament.

""I have done the work,"" Raonic said. ""I have put in the effort, and I'm just happy that this quickly the pieces are coming together.""

This was Murray's first tournament appearance since November. He missed time due to a pelvic injury and is playing on a metal hip after two operations on that joint.

""Didn’t play well. It was not a good day,"" Murray said. ""The positives are that I got three matches in. Physically, I pulled up OK.""

Women’s quarterfinal matchups set earlier in the day were two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka against Anett Kontaveit, former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka against Ons Jabeur, and 83rd-ranked American qualifier Jessica Pegula against No. 14 Elise Mertens.

He was 5 under after the front nine Tuesday at Ozarks National when he hit driver at the par-4 10th. The ball wound up in such heavy rough that Mickelson couldn't find it, forcing him to take a penalty stroke. He still wound up making a long putt to salvage bogey, and that gave him some momentum for the rest of the round.

""I was able to get right back to even par on the back side with a birdie on the next hole, and then I made a couple more coming in,"" said Mickelson, whose 7-under 64 left him 17 under.

That was good for a four-shot lead over Tim Petrovic and Rod Pampling, who will be his playing partners for the final round. Mike Weir of Bright's Grove, Ont., (69) was nine shots off the lead at 8 under.

""I've been putting really well,"" Mickelson said. ""Today I didn't drive it the way I've been driving it. I kind of a hung a few drives, so I'm going to the range and try to work on that now. But when I come out tomorrow I'll try to be a little bit more aggressive with the driver and see if I can make a few more birdies.""

A few more? He's already made 19 of them in his first 36 holes.

Playing in the final group and with the shadows getting long, Mickelson picked up right where he left off after his opening-round 61. He made birdie at the third and then rattled off three straight beginning at the par-4 fifth, where he nearly chipped in for eagle.

Petrovic tried to make a run at Mickelson, but even one of his career-low rounds only got him so close. His putter went cold down the stretch and a poor approach at the par-4 finishing hole resulted in bogey.

Mickelson added a bridie at the ninth, the only hole he bogeyed on Monday, after a pretty flop shot over the bunker. After the lost ball at the 10th, Mickelson responded by adding two more birdies.

The second of them at the par-3 12th was a backhanded tap-in. His approach shot barely carried onto the front edge of the green, then nestled up to about an inch from the hole.

Mickelson could still squander the lead in the final round Wednesday, when tee times were moved to the early morning because of expected bad weather in the afternoon. But given the quality of his short game through 36 holes, the more pressing question is whether he could break the PGA Tour Champions' 54-hole scoring record of 191 — shared by Bruce Fleisher, Loren Roberts, Bernhard Langer, David Frost and Rocco Mediate.

Mickelson, who decided to make his debut on the over-50 tour to continue his U.S. Open prep after he was eliminated from the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, would need to shoot 65 in his final round Wednesday to move atop the list.

Petrovic and Pampling each shot 64-65 over the first two rounds. Rocco Mediate struggled coming in and was at 12 under.

K.J. Choi was another shot back, and Steve Stricker and David McKenzie were at 10 under.

Moments later, the Chicago White Sox right-hander threw the final pitch in a truly bizarre performance.

article continues below

A no-fan no-no.

With the seats at Guaranteed Rate Field empty, Giolito pitched the first no-hitter of the pandemic-delayed season, striking out 13 in leading the White Sox over the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 Tuesday night.

""2020 has been a very strange year,"" said Giolito, who conducted a postgame interview while wearing a mask. ""Obviously a lot of weird stuff going on with COVID and the state of the world, so may as well throw this in the mix.""

Sounds like he didn't mind that nobody saw it. Well, almost no one.

After right fielder Adam Engel extended on the run to catch Erik Gonzalez’s slicing drive toward the line for the final out, the hollers of Giolito’s teammates in the middle of the diamond echoed around the stadium.

""I’m just stoked for Lucas and so happy and ecstatic and emotional for Lucas,"" Engel said. ""It stinks we couldn’t celebrate the way most no-hitters get celebrated.""

The smallest crowd listed for any no-hitter in the majors over the last 100 years came in 1944, when a mere 1,014 watched Cincinnati’s Clyde Shoun beat the Braves at Crosley Field.

Nowhere close to that number on this night, not with the park that holds over 40,000 closed to fans because of virus protocols.

Suffice to say, years from now when White Sox fans fondly remember Giolito’s gem, there will not be, say, 100,000 or so people claiming they were there to see it in person.

At one point early in the game, some members of grounds crew drifted in sight, but that was about it outside of the teams.

An All-Star last year, the 26-year-old Giolito (3-2) matched his career high for strikeouts set in his previous start against Detroit.

Only a four-pitch walk to Gonzalez leading off the fourth inning got in Giolito’s way of perfection. That was only runner he permitted while throwing 101 pitches

""I’ve been working for this type of game for a while now and it’s really cool that we got it done,"" Giolito said.

Giolito relied on his changeup and fastball to make quick work of the Pirates, who came into the game batting just .229 and have the worst record in the majors. Six of their starters finished the game hitting under .199 this season.

The White Sox rushed toward the mound after the final out in Giolito’s first career no-hitter. Giolito hugged catcher James McCann as the Chicago players joined the party.

The South Side of Chicago normally rattles with fireworks after a home win -- this is the club that gave the game the exploding scoreboard -- but the park remained silent as the dugout emptied.

Giolito, meanwhile, was locked in his own zone in the later innings, fully aware of what was at stake.

""After the seventh, six more outs, looking at who I was facing, became very, very, very possible,"" he said, ""and then we were able to get it done.""

Giolito said his approach never wavered.

""Just staying with the same, like, mental routine for every single pitch. One pitch at a time. Full focus, full execution, straight through the target,"" he said.

Giolito pitched the 19th no-hitter in White Sox history — second most to the Dodgers' 23 — and first since Philip Humber threw a perfect game at Seattle in 2012. This was the seventh time the Pirates have been held hitless, with Washington’s Max Scherzer having done it in 2015.

White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson made a nifty play on a grounder by Bryan Reynolds up the middle in the seventh to preserve the gem, helped by first baseman Jose Abreu’s stretch at the bag.

In the ninth, Gonzalez hit a liner that Engel, a fleet centre fielder for most of his career, caught on the run at knee-high height.

""Yeah man, I think I got it,"" Gonzalez said. ""With that at-bat, I was a little bit mad because I don’t want to be part of history.""

Giolito improved to 30-28 in his big league career. He made his debut with Washington in 2016, then was traded after that season to the White Sox in a package for outfielder Adam Eaton.

Giolito gave up a major league-high 118 earned runs in 2018, his first full season in Chicago.

""I was pretty much bottom of the league in almost every stat,"" Giolito said. ""I kind of had to ... learn from failure to learn my true potential.""

He added: ""I always envisioned that I’d throw a no-hitter in the big leagues.""

Giolito threw the first no-hitter at Guaranteed Rate Field since Minnesota’s Francisco Liriano did it in 2011.

The White Sox, who’ve won eight of their last nine, ended the Pirates’ season-best winning streak at three games.

Giolito was dominant in his previous start, too, fanning 13 against Detroit and allowing just three hits in seven innings. The victory over Pittsburgh was his third career shutout.

Chicago’s first three batters reached in the second and all three came home one at a time after Engel’s groundout and singles Anderson and Eloy Jimenez. McCann added a sacrifice fly in the third off Steven Brault (0-1).

TRAINER’S ROOM

Pirates: RH reliever Keone Kela was available to pitch after leaving Friday’s loss to Milwaukee with forearm tightness. … Infielders Colin Moran (collision) and Kevin Newman (abdomen) also were on the bench after leaving Sunday’s game.

White Sox: McCann stayed in the game after being struck near his left hand by a second-inning pitch from Brault. ... Jimenez appeared to be getting treatment near the mound after the celebration, but manager Rick Renteria said he walked off under his own power.

UP NEXT

LHP Dallas Keuchel (4-2, 2.65) looks for his third straight win Wednesday afternoon against Pirates RHP Trevor Williams (1-4, 3.70).

""If there was one message that was going on it was we liked everything that was going on about the game,"" Cooper said. ""I know it sounds so cliche, but we just had to stick with it. Some teams, if you have mental weakness at all, you're probably sitting there saying, 'Poor us.'

""But it's just not been this group. That's not how they operate.""

Brad Marchand buried his second of the night to tie things with under four minutes left in the third period for the Bruins, while Nick Ritchie also scored. David Pastrnak added two assists for Boston, which got 36 stops from Jaroslav Halak.

The teams don't have much time to digest the result, with Game 3 of the best-of-seven matchup set for Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET back inside the fan-less Scotiabank Arena.

Tampa, which beat the Columbus Blue Jackets in quintuple overtime of Game 1 in the opening round before closing out the series in the extra period of Game 5 on a pair of goals from Brayden Point, got the winner after Boston couldn't clear its zone.

Patrick Maroon tried a wraparound that Halak stopped, but Palat was there to bury the rebound to score his first of the post-season and send the Lightning pouring off their bench in celebration.

""It's obviously big-time frustrating any time you lose a game and especially in that fashion,"" Bruins centre Sean Kuraly said. ""We thought we were trending in the right direction, (thinking) momentum may be swinging our way. You get the puck close to the blue line a couple times and you don't get it out, and against a good team that's what happens.

""It ends up in the back of your net.""

Acquired prior to February's trade deadline from the New Jersey Devils, Coleman gave Tampa its first lead of the series at 10:40 of the third after taking a stretch pass from Victor Hedman. The Lightning centre moved in alone on Halak and snuck an off-speed shot through the five-hole after getting slashed by Bruins defenceman Connor Clifton.

Boston, however, responded with 3:58 left in regulation when Marchand finished off a pretty passing play. With the Bruins in the middle of a change — Patrice Bergeron would normally be on the ice — Kuraly took a feed from Pastrnak and quickly found Marchand to bury his sixth and knot things up.

The Bruins, who triumphed 3-2 in Game 1 on the back of Halak's 35-save performance, took a 2-1 lead with 5:27 left in the second on a power play when Pastrnak faked a one-timer before sliding a pass to Marchand at the side of the net.

Tampa responded 56 seconds later after some great work from Point. The diminutive centre twisted and turned in the Bruins zone before finding Kevin Shattenkirk, whose shot was tipped in by Kucherov for his third.

The Lightning dressed seven defencemen with Ryan McDonagh (undisclosed), who has averaged a team-high 26:07 of ice time in the post-season, out injured after leaving midway through the third period of Game 1. Veteran blue-liners Luke Schenn and Braydon Coburn drew in, while Carter Verhaeghe was scratched up front.

Boston owned the best record in the NHL when the league suspended its season because of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, but dropped to the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference after losing all three of its games in the round-robin portion of the restart.

The Bruins found their groove in the first round of the usual 16-team playoff bracket, disposing of the Carolina Hurricanes in five games.

Tampa, meanwhile, had the second-best mark in the East and was fourth overall when the schedule was halted. The Lightning finished second in the round-robin and then downed Columbus.

The Bruins jumped out to a 1-0 lead at 3:14 of Tuesday's first period after Tampa defenceman Zach Bogosian's stick disintegrated at the offensive blue line. Boston broke the other way, with Ritchie stuffing his first past Vasilevskiy, who thought he had the puck covered — much to Cooper's chagrin.

The Lightning responded a couple minutes later when Barclay Goodrow tipped Coburn's point shot up and over Halak. The Bruins, however, correctly challenged for offside after Point was a fraction of a second too slow exiting the Boston zone on the tag up.

Cooper fired a number of expletives at the officials when the call was reversed, but was back smiling on the bench after a surprising burst from an unlikely source eventually knotted the score.

Bogosian, a bruising blue-liner known mostly for his physical play, split two Boston defenders, and as he was getting knocked down fed a diving Coleman, who slid his second past Halak before crashing into the net at 12:42.

""I saw Bogo picking up some speed,"" Coleman said. ""He just kind of had that look in his eye like he was about to do something. I just made it a point to get up into play with him, try to give him an option.

""He made a heck of a play.""

It was also the first sign the Lightning weren't going to be fazed by that early adversity.

""Any time there's a mishap, you just turn the page,"" Cooper said of his roster. ""It was needed tonight, I'll tell you that, because they need to be rewarded for the work they were doing.

""And in the end, they were.""

The All-Star guard scored 35 points and the Los Angeles Clippers rolled past the Dallas Mavericks 154-111 on Tuesday night to take a 3-2 lead in their first-round Western Conference playoff series.

George had shot 29% in the series and endured fans' wrath on social media. He said he spoke to the team psychiatrist before Game 5.

""I mean, whatever it was, the bubble got the best of me,"" George said. ""I was just in a dark place. I really wasn’t here. I checked out. The past couple of games, it was just difficult.""

George said it didn't feel like the playoffs until his teammates decided to create the atmosphere that was lacking inside the NBA's Walt Disney World bubble.

""I came in with that mindset that this is Staples, we’re at home,"" he said. ""The place is packed. I really had to psych myself up. I thought the whole team took that and we ran with it. We created our own energy. We decided to dictate this game.""

Kawhi Leonard scored 32 points and Montrezl Harrell added 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers, who set a franchise record for points in a playoff game. Los Angeles can clinch the series on Thursday.

Dallas' Luka Doncic, who hit a game-winner at the buzzer in Game 4 to cap off a 43-point triple-double, was held to 22 points on 6-for-17 shooting.

Dallas coach Rick Carlisle was ejected in the third quarter of the testy game, which included six technicals and a flagrant-1 foul.

Doncic said Clippers forward Marcus Morris might have stepped on his ankle intentionally early in the third quarter.

""I don’t want to talk to him,"" Doncic said. ""He’s just saying a lot of bad stuff to me all the game. I don’t want to talk to him. I’ve just got to move on. Like I said, everybody’s going to have their own opinion. I just hope it wasn’t intentional. If that was intentional, that’s very bad.""

Mavericks centre Kristaps Porzingis sat out with right knee soreness. It was the second straight game the 7-foot-3 Latvian missed.

Leonard scored 22 points and Paul George scored 18 to help Los Angeles take a 76-52 lead at halftime. The Clippers shot 61% in the first half and led by as many as 27 points.

The Clippers continued the onslaught in the second half, bumping the lead to as many as 45 points.

""Tough game,"" Carlisle said. ""Very poor performance by us. It was disappointing. It was very physical. We just need to have a stronger physical disposition to start the game and throughout. We’ve got to get some more traction at both ends of the floor.""

TIP-INS

Mavericks: Doncic was issued a technical foul in the second quarter. ... G Tim Hardaway Jr. was called for a flagrant-1 after winding up and hitting George in the face on a drive. ... Assistant Stephen Silas took over as coach after Carlisle was ejected.

Clippers: Shot 67% from the field in the first quarter. ... Hardaway and Morris were called for double technicals in the second quarter. C Ivica Zubac was called for a technical in the third.

BIGGER THAN BASKETBALL

Clippers coach Doc Rivers was emotional while discussing the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which has sparked national outrage and some violent protests. Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back while his three children watched.

""That video, if you watch that video — you don’t need to be Black to be outraged,"" Rivers said. ""You need to be American and outraged. How dare the Republicans talk about fear. We’re the ones that need to be scared. We’re the ones having to talk to every Black child. What white father has to give his son a talk about being careful if you get pulled over? It’s just ridiculous. It keeps going. There’s no charges. Breonna Taylor — no charges. Nothing. All we’re asking is you live up to the Constitution. That’s all we’re asking -- for everybody. For everyone.""

CARLISLE'S EJECTION

Carlisle described what led to his ejection. Hardaway had the ball at the free-throw line, and then Rivers was granted a timeout.

""My understanding in that situation is that once a shooter has the ball, a timeout cannot be called by the opposing coach,"" Carlisle said. ""I thought the call was wrong. So I was asking about it and wasn’t getting a great explanation and then it turned into a technical and then another technical. I’m just standing up for my team.""

Game 6 is Thursday.

Rolling along the blessedly flat plain between Lucca and Pisa, under bright blue skies and with a gentle breeze at our backs, I have time to ponder some of life’s big questions, like what’s for lunch?

article continues below

Also, exactly what kind of black magic or, possibly, mathematics, is involved in keeping that tall tower on the horizon from tipping over? We’re at least five kilometres from Pisa, but we can clearly make out the iconic building with the significant tilt. From this first look, I would go so far as to call it a “leaning tower.” The closer we get, the more obvious — and dangerous-looking — is the lean. Seriously, what is keeping that thing up?

Lean into it

To answer that question, we have to first ask why it’s leaning at all. Back in 1160, Pisa had more than 10,000 towers (if you define “tower” as more than several dozen blocks piled on top of each other). Interestingly, none of those towers included a campanile, or bell tower (if you define “interestingly” as not at all interesting). Anyway, the lack of a bell tower was a problem until 1172, when local bell-tower enthusiast Berta di Bernardo died and left 60 pieces of silver to the city for the construction of a campanile.

Work began on the bell tower in 1173, led by Bonanno Pisano, a name I did not make up but wish I had. Signore Pisano was a very good sculptor, but a very bad geotechnical engineer. He did not know that beneath Piazza dei Miracoli’s lawns lay a 40-metre-deep mix of sand and clay, which is about as suitable a substrate for 56-metre-high marble buildings as banana-cream pudding.

After five years of construction, when the tower was just three storeys high, it had already started to tilt. So, in the spirit of all good municipal projects, work was put off for another 100 years.

When work resumed in 1272, the tilt was compensated for by building upward with a slight curve. The tower was eventually completed another 100 years later, in 1372. Somehow, the tower never got around to falling over — seven bells inside the tower, each sounding a different musical note, were rung from the ground by a team of 14 probably deaf men from 1370 until 1950.

Every year it leaned a little more, and by the 19th century, it was generally believed that the tower was deliberately built to lean.

In 1990, the tower was closed to the public while 1,000 tonnes of lead ingots were placed on the north side to counteract the building’s lean, and giant steel bands were wrapped around the second storey to hold it together. It didn’t work.

In 1995, the tower slipped 2.5 millimetres, prompting the insertion of more steel braces and cables while engineers removed 70 tonnes of earth from the high side of the foundations. Happily, this did work. In fact, it might have worked too well.

Not only is the tower stable, it is correcting itself toward the vertical. The latest measurements suggest that the tower’s iconic 43.8-centimetre lean might one day decrease to zero. Warning: you only have until the year 2300 before this happens.

Climbing the tower is a must-do, not just for the spectacular view of the Romanesque cityscape, but also to learn new appreciation for how good your body is at sensing when all is not plumb with the world. Climbing the well-worn 251 steps to the top floor provides a bizarre sensation of both falling forward and climbing backward as you circumnavigate the inside of the tower. The 3.9 degrees of tilt may not sound like much, but it’s very obvious to your toes.

The Leaning Tower is not the only beautiful building to explore in Pisa — or even the only one within the grounds of the Piazza dei Miracoli, which also contains the Duomo di Santa Maria Assunta, a striking 11th-century church and baptistry, and the Camposanto, said to contain soil from Calvary taken during the Crusades.

Unsurprisingly, all those famous buildings bring in the tourists, more than one million of them every year to a city of just 89,000. Such an overabundance of prey, in turn, brings in the predators, which means the usual cadre of pickpockets, North African cheap-crap-from-China merchants, and overpriced restaurants.

A day spent avoiding fistfights with all of the annoying above left me exhausted and a little glad that our cycle trip across Tuscany was officially over.

Of course, saying goodbye to the bikes and our cycle group doesn’t mean this is the end to overindulging in pasta and Chianti. We have one more stop to make before leaving Italy …

The Five Steep Lands

The Cinque Terre (Italian for “five lands”) is a string of centuries-old villages on the rugged Italian Riviera coastline: Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Cleveland, Ohio. Wait, that’s a typo, it should read Monterosso al Mare.

The most difficult thing about getting to the Cinque Terre is admitting to your wife that you are completely turned around, and have no idea where the Pisa train station is. Once this wee difficulty is sorted out (“I am almost nearly 100 per cent certain it’s over there, or possibly somewhere else. Yes, dear, yes of course, dear. By all means lead on if you think you know better”), it requires just two easy train rides, the latter of which takes eight minutes and drops you off at the bottom of the first village, stunning Riomaggiore.

When I say bottom of the first village, I refer to the mildly unpleasant fact — from the perspective of my knees — that our Airbnb is located at the top of the first village, at an elevation roughly equivalent to the base camp at Mount Everest.

This isn’t just a Riomaggiore thing; all five villages are tucked into the steep cliffs above the Mediterranean. It accounts for the stunning views, both from the bottom looking upward to the colourful homes and businesses stacked one on top of the other with vineyards and olive groves in the background; and from the top looking downward to the deep blue sea. Another plus of the steep main street (there is only one) and the myriad steep stairs and pathways, is that the farther you go up, the fewer tourists there are.

There are a lot of tourists here, naturally. The Cinque Terre is a national park and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, famed for the rugged landscape that draws hikers and sightseers from as far away as the Andromeda Galaxy.

However, it’s not actually very touristy. In fact, one of the many things I like about this place is the lack of predators looking to sell junk to the punters. This is the opposite of Pisa and Rome — it feels more like an outpost on the edge of the world, rather than the hub of an empire.

For example, there are no SPQR symbols on statues and manhole covers (also, there are no statues or manholes to cover), which are found all over the city of Rome. SPQR stands for the Latin Senatus Populusque Romanus, which means: “The senate and the people of Rome welcome your tourist dollars.”

Each of the five villages is connected by railway, water taxi and a network of hiking trails, so it’s easy to get from one to another.

Each village is unique, with its own restaurants and shops and overall atmosphere, despite the fact that they are only separated by a few kilometres. When you visit, just choose one village as your base — you can’t pick wrongly — and day-trip to the others.

We spend three days exploring the Cinque Terre, which was not nearly enough for some parts of my body, and way too much for others. Leaving this quiet, beautiful part of the world is as easy as arriving — just two train rides and we are back in in the hustle and bustle of Rome.

Ciao Italia!

Only it isn’t that easy, not really. Leaving Italy proves to be oddly disquieting. On the eve of our departure, I can’t help but wonder what just happened. Did we really spend two weeks cycling the length and breadth of Tuscany with those crazy people from all over the world?

It seems as though I have been living in a dream, as do all my adventures. Sitting alone on a whitewashed bench under a fig tree, I ponder how travel demands such good questions about the way we work and live and eat and sleep and fight and love back home.

A few bittersweet lines in Alfred, Lord Tennyson’s sublime poem Ulysses always come to mind when I am about to leave an adventure overseas for home:

For always roaming with a hungry heart

Much have I seen and known; cities of men

And manners, climates, councils, governments,

Myself not least, but honour’d of them all;

And drunk delight of battle with my peers,

Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.

I am a part of all that I have met;

Yet all experience is an arch wherethro’

Gleams that untravell’d world whose margin fades

For ever and forever when I move.

This isn’t the windy plains of Troy, nor am I honour’d for battle here, but I do well know that I am a part of all that I have met, for ever and forever when I move.

Ciao Italy.

Today is a day of wonder and discovery in northern Tuscany! After our standard 10,000-calorie breakfast, we mount up and bike off in the direction of Castelnuovo di Garfagnana, a 13th-century town nestled in a valley at the confluence of the Serchio and Territe Secca rivers.

article continues below

Let me cut to the chase and tell you about today’s main discovery: My brain turns off when I read too much Italian, as in the paragraph above. “What, exactly, is a Garfagnana?” says my brain. When nobody answers — probably a good thing — it drools.

This is despite a childhood largely devoted to televised police action dramas, featuring stereotypical Italian bad guys, sandwiched between commercials with stereotypical Italian good guys flogging Ragu and Alka Seltzer. My point is that despite all the years of TV preparation, I do not actually speak or read the lingo Italiano.

How to speak like an Italian

It’s not just the foreign-looking and strange-sounding words that make Italian such a challenge. It’s the attitude, and it’s difficult to fake. Until now:

First, touch all the fingertips of your right hand together. Now rapidly open and close your fingertips above your palm. OK, you’re almost there, just add a little wrist action. The last step is to yell loudly into a face — anybody’s face — the name of your favourite pasta and/or soccer team, over and over. That’s it! You are speaking like an Italian.

Eventually, I came to realize that not all Italians are extremely angry all of the time. They just sound that way. The Italian language, accompanied as it always is with wild arm gesticulations and finger jabs, is not meant to convey tender mercies so much as naked fury and soccer-match results. For example, the taxi driver I was convinced was threatening to murder me and my extended family was just turning left.

My wife, who is afflicted with a condition doctors describe as “smarter than me,” actually learned the Italian language prior to our trip. I was going to do that, too, but there were quite a few interesting programs on Netflix, and also there was sleeping, and beer. Anyway, my point is that learning even the basics of a language really helps in pronouncing place names, asking for directions, and choosing the right pasta for hand-to-hand combat.

A short-cut to learning Italian is to simply -—but angrily — employ one or more of the following phrases:

• Ahhhhh, now that’s Italian! (appropriate for food, traffic, leaning towers)

• That’s a spicy meatball! (appropriate for meatballs, bowel movements)

• Mama mia! (appropriate for calling your mother, Abba concerts, the Vatican)

By the way, “Garfagnana” describes the condition when you blink, and the gentle hills of Tuscany turn into the imposing wall of the Apuan Alps. Probably.

Garfagnana

The Garfagnana is gorgeous in a region that is already gorgeous. Small towns dot nearly every high spot above lush hillsides bursting with grapes, olives and everything else that’s green and growable. It’s like biking through a big salad.

In the far distance, a black dot on the ridgeline will later turn out to be a massive fortress, the Verrucole Castle.

We’re still too far away to make out the crenelated battlements high above the green valley, but we each know, deep in our thighs, that this ride will fully justify tonight’s wine, pasta and more wine.

The castle is 600 metres above sea level. It makes sense to pick a high spot for your fortress.

When bad people come to take away your stuff, such as your livestock and/or daughters, you can escape to the big impregnable castle and drop rocks on their heads until they go away.

As a plus, they might die on the seven-kilometre climb up from the valley below.

The Verrucole Castle was built between the 10th and 13th centuries by the Gherardinghi family to help keep nearby Lucca’s feudal ambitions in check.

Over the years, it has been accurately restored by a team of mostly volunteer historians, archeologists, architects and teachers, each passionate about faithful historical reconstruction.

This is the best kind of time travel: you wander around and learn how rooms and gardens were organized in the 12th century, but you get to keep your shoes and vaccinations against communicable diseases.

Well, I got to keep my shoes. A few in our group, wearing the kind of expensive cycling shoes that cause Achilles tendinitis and plantar fasciitis, had to leave them at the bottom of the steep hill you must walk up to enter the castle.

The spectacular view of the Garfagnana is worth the blisters.

The bad news is that today’s ride is 87 km long. The good news is that the first 17 km of it is all downhill. The, uh, other bad news is that the downhill begins at the top of the Apuan Alps in the rain. The temperature this morning is a crisp 4 C, and most of our group wears yesterday’s socks on their hands, not having packed for Outer Hebrides-type weather.

Despite — or possibly because of — the cold, the ride is exhilarating. We are the only ones on the road, zipping down the asphalt at automobile speeds. The narrow road precipitously drops off to the right, as the valley expands and expands and expands until we can almost see the mists of the Tyrrhenian Sea to the west.

We are the only ones on the road, right up until the moment when we suddenly share the road with large trucks burdened with giant blocks of marble, barrelling past us in what must be a concerted effort on the part of the drivers not to use up any expensive brake pads.

Italian marble — the good stuff, we are told — is quarried from these mountains, and it is cut and shipped out from the towns on the coast far below. You know you’re in one of them by the marble sidewalk curbs and public drinking fountains.

Lovely Lucca

Garfagnana has a massive hilltop fortress, whereas Lucca — on the plains 50 kilometres to the south — has a massive wall. The 4.2-km Renaissance-era wall that still encircles the old town is actually Lucca’s fourth wall, the first of which was built by the Romans when they founded Lucca by stealing it from the Etruscans in 180 BC. It outlasted the Romans by a thousand or so years, until 1118, when Lucca became a commune, or self-governing city state. The wall was expanded in 1300, and then again in 1504.

Why so many walls? You guessed it: so many wars. When gunpowder became a mainstay of Western military conflict at the end of the 15th century, high walls became an expensive liability. High walls are great for thwarting climbers, archers and biting monkeys, but they are absolutely crap against cannons. This is why the grass- and tree-topped walls around Lucca are wide enough to play a game of rugby.

Lucca was an independent city state for 700 years, becoming rich from the silk trade and good diplomatic relations with the Pope. The only army to ever breach the walls and conquer Lucca (in 1805) was that of our old pal, Napoleon Bonaparte, who — I’m mostly not making this up — began his military career as an artillery specialist and monkey handler. Today, the walls remain intact, a broad pedestrian and cyclist promenade encircling a truly beautiful city. Lucca boasts gorgeous cathedrals, offices, museums and the suspiciously amphitheatre-shaped Piazza dell’Anfiteatro, built around a Roman amphitheatre.

Outside our hotel is a large, bronze statue of a moustachioed-man lounging cross-legged in a chair, smoking and looking bored. This is Giacomo Puccini (1858-1924), born in Lucca to become the greatest Italian opera composer after Verdi.

I don’t know if that “after Verdi” bit refers to Giuseppe Verdi’s chronologically first appearance in Italy (1813-1901), or to his being a better opera composer than Puccini. I have no way of judging the quality of opera music, which sounds to me like a whole lot of hollering and dramatic shrieking held together with pretty arias, the acoustic equivalent of duct tape. I only know two things about going to the opera: first, you are supposed to wear pants; and second, you must shout, “Thar she blows!” when the soprano lets fly in Act I.

What’s opera, doc?

The Italian word for opera turns out to be opera, which means “work” in the sense of the labour done (the mental and physical exertion), the result produced (This opera is my greatest achievement!) and the effort required to sit there and listen to it (I need a drink!).

No, opera is not for everybody. Most people typing these words right now (me) recognize opera as great music, but that doesn’t mean they (me) necessarily like it.

There are a few good reasons for people’s reluctance to embrace this form of classical combat theatre:

1. Opera does not come cheap.

2. Opera does not come short.

3. While it is true that opera finishes when the fat lady sings, it also begins that way, and is that way in the middle, too.

The good people of Lucca might have fixed those issues (well, two out of three ain’t bad). Every night of the year — for more than 40 years — a short evening concert is offered in the Chiesa e Battistero dei SS Giovanni e Reparata, a magnificent decommissioned church originally built in the 12th century.

It features a hauntingly beautiful interior with very hard chairs, all the better to keep you from falling asleep and taking a grievous elbow to the ribs from certain other audience members, by which I mean my wife.

The concert, which is different every night of the year, only lasts an hour, and only costs 25 euros. On the night we attended, the set list contained an enjoyable mix of arias by both Puccini and Verdi, and for the life of me, I can’t tell you which guy is better.

Who cares? Sitting in that beautiful Renaissance church, listening to talented musicians play and sing, I admit opera doesn’t seem like work at all.

Next week: Our tour winds down by winding up the many stairs of a certain wobbly tower, and then it’s many, many more stairs in beautiful Cinque Terre.

The latest, surprising revelation began when Karen and Tanya asked for a tour through the garden. After observing the vegetable plantings, the berry bushes, and fruiting trees and vines, they commented that I must have a super-sized freezer.

I do not. My freezer is a modest size. But I didn’t think any more about the comment until a next-door neighbour stopped me on my way to the nearby mail boxes to tell me how she was busily blanching and freezing beets and other vegetables in her newly established food garden.

As she spoke I realized that she, and probably the neighbours who made the freezer comment, did not know that many edibles can be stored right where they’ve grown, out in the garden.

Of course, many must be harvested at their peak and used, or processed and stored — the berries, tree fruits, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and so on. But cold-hardy foods can be left in the garden, with simple measures in place to protect them from severe temperatures.

Root vegetables store in fine eating condition in the soil where they grew. My bed of carrots, parsnips and beets feeds me through the winter and into early spring. A five-cm cover of soil over the roots once the tops have withered and are cleared away protects the root “shoulders” from frost damage. In some winters, when severe freezing temperatures are expected, I spread sheets of old floating row cover over the plantings too.

Another, smaller bed containing a second carrot planting and two varieties of daikon radish, all seeded at the beginning of July, will get the same treatment. Last winter, my friends and I enjoyed a daikon called Alpine, from Johnny’s Selected Seeds (JSS), grated into green salads and combined with grated carrot and sometimes apple in a lemon juice and oil vinaigrette.

This year, I have a planting of Alpine again, joined by another from JSS. KN-Bravo has grown even more vigorously than Alpine. This autumn I’m looking forward to savouring the purple and white flesh of this daikon.

Almost all leek varieties are fine left in the garden and can be harvested through the winter. Kale fares well through most winters, as do many hardy green leafy vegetables. They include cold-hardy lettuces, whose names sometimes indicate their tolerance of cold temperatures. Examples are Winter Density and Arctic King.

Many flavourful leafy green vegetables that add zest to winter salads also can weather the cold. My favourites: endive, spinach, mizuna, radicchio and komatsuna.

A mulching around the plants late in the fall helps to protect their roots. If severe freezing temperatures are about to visit the garden, cover the greens temporarily with old floating row cover, lightweight curtaining, or whatever you have on hand. One winter, I saved a prized bed of radicchio with three layers of row cover.

Winter vegetable enthusiasts delight in growing overwintering cauliflower and sprouting broccoli for the fresh, tasty foods they provide in late winter and early spring.

Transplants of many cold-hardy vegetables are available in garden centres this month, for anyone interested in transforming part of the garden into an outdoor winter pantry.

Of cats and squirrels. The cats-and-birds saga continues as notes keep rolling in on the predatory nature of free-roaming cats and on measures taken to reduce the success rate of their hunting, such as jingly bells and colourful, clown-like ruffs around the neck.

The latest lament, from a reader in Saanich, describes the disappearance of quail, lizards and snakes in her garden and in the wider neighbourhood with the arrival of families with “outdoor” cats.

The reader has a suggestion. Allow cats to enjoy the outdoors in safety and protect wildlife at the same time by installing a “catio.”

What’s a catio? A patio for cats — an outdoor enclosure that can be a cat run, a cat playpen, a windowbox or balcony space, or some other variation. See the possibilities at catioworld.com.

Wendy, who gardens in Brentwood Bay, sent in a smile-inducing photo of a squirrel stretching to reach the rim of a trug.

“It was such a ‘chance’ picture. I was sitting inside and my puppy did not spot and chase away the squirrel.” Wendy’s caption for the photo: “My helper.”"

Comparable store sales in the U.S. spiked 35.1% at Lowe's, and online orders more than doubled.

The report, issued Wednesday, comes one day after Home Depot reported similarly explosive sales.

Lowe's move to revamp its outdated online business paid off in the fiscal first quarter, as shoppers shut in because of the pandemic shifted to online services for supplies for their do-it-yourself home projects. Lowe's CEO Marvin Ellison told analysts during the earnings call Wednesday that many of these projects weren't planned on the list, but were extra projects.

""Customers are finding projects around the house,"" he said. ""We don't see this as pull-forward. We see this as incremental.""

During a call with The Associated Press, Ellison said that some of the money from the government stimulus checks is spurring sales, but shoppers are also diverting their spending away from travelling and other areas toward the home.

Lowe's revenue for the three months ended July 31 climbed to $27.3 billion from $21 billion, the company said Wednesday, far better than the $24.85 billion analysts expected, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.

Online sales soared 135%, while same-store sales, including those outside the U.S., rose 34.2%.

Ellison said in a prepared statement that customers seemed mostly focused on repair and maintenance of their homes.

At the same time, many are focused on finding a new home with more space for an office from which to work remotely, or one with a yard rather than a stoop.

On Tuesday the Commerce Department reported that construction of new U.S. homes surged 22.6% last month. The department said that new homes were started at an annual pace of nearly 1.5 million in July, the highest since February and well above what economists were expecting.

The National Association of Realtors said last month that its index of pending sales rose 16.6%, to 116.1 in June, its highest level since 2006.

Lowe's earned $2.83 billion, or $3.74 per share, in the quarter. Removing restructuring costs, earnings were $3.75 per share. That's better than the $3.03 per share Wall Street expected.

Shares of Lowe's Cos., based in Mooresville, North Carolina, climbed slightly Wednesday and are hovering at around $158.

L.S.

Not at all. For berries in the first year, however, the seeds need to be started indoors in late winter. The plants make neat, compact plants that are ideal for tucking into sunny spots along pathways, at the corners of vegetable plots and along flower bed edges. The plants make no runners, but they self-sow modestly.

I began growing them when I noticed a listing in a catalogue for a variety called Baron Solemacher. The next variety I grew was Alexandria. These named varieties, called “alpine” strawberries, are selected forms of the wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca). The alpines, though still small, are larger than the wild berries.

Currently, both West Coast Seeds (WCS) and William Dam Seeds list Mignonette, which WCS describes as having berries “that are larger than most alpine strawberries. They are bright red, deliciously sweet. The compact perennial plants form pretty little mounds that will bear strawberries the first year.”

Richters Herbs lists the wild strawberry and an alpine called Ruegen, also described as producing berries twice the size of the wild ones on compact, runnerless plants.

Alpine strawberries are everbearing in the true sense. They yield pointed little berries from mid to late spring right through to mid-autumn. They are one of my favourite in-garden snacks.

I plan on seeding both Ruegen and Mignonette next year, to begin replenishing my stock of plants, which has dwindled over the years. I have friends who never pass one of these plants in my garden without stopping to check it out for ripe little berries.

You’ll find the plants easy to grow and manage. If your neighbour’s plants self-sow liberally, she may have extra baby plants to share — if you feel comfortable asking.

Dear Helen: The home we bought came with a garden where Euphorbia had spread into many areas. When my husband cut some of the plants back on a hot day early in the month, he ended up in hospital after some of the plants’ white sap splashed into his eyes. Could you warn people about this? How can we eradicate the Euphorbia safely?

K.D.

The milky sap of Euphorbia plants is toxic, and a skin and eye irritant.

The degree of toxicity varies among the many species. The toxic sap developed over time as the plants evolved to avoid browsing by herbivorous animals.

Getting the sap on hands and arms while cutting the plants can cause inflammation. Affected skin, exposed to sun, can blister. The sap needs to be removed right away with soap and water. Getting the sap in the eyes can be very serious. I’m glad your husband sought immediate medical help.

Many species self-sow prolifically. Be sure not to let any of the plants form seeds. Pulling or digging up the plants, and watching carefully for seedlings and removing them, will gradually eliminate the plants. These measures have worked for me.

Before taking any eradication measures, wear eye protection, gloves, and a long-sleeved shirt. I opt also to don my broad-brimmed garden hat. I also avoid working with such plants on hot, sunny days.

I observe the same precautions when pruning the fig tree, which has a similarly irritating sap, especially in the presence of sunlight.

Dear Helen: The foliage on my blueberry plants is fading to yellow and cream, while the leaf veins remain bright green. Why is this happening? What can I do?

M.L.

Blueberry leaves that yellow between the veins indicate a soil pH that is too high (not acidic enough). Blueberries thrive in acidic soils with a pH range between 4.5 and 5.5 — well below the neutral 7.0 on the pH scale.

You can begin acidifying the soil naturally by mulching around the bushes with pine needles, shredded leaves, or well rotted sawdust. Peat acidifies too, but laid as mulch it crusts over to shed water.

I save and scatter used coffee grounds, in modest amounts at a time, around the blueberries. The grounds are highly acidic and suitable for scattering around acid-loving plants.

Powdered sulphur scratched into the soil is another effective acidifier. Early in the spring, consider fertilizing with product recommended for azaleas and rhododendrons."

The Strata Property Act has a simple formula for determining the minimum contingency contribution each year as part of the annual operating budget, but not the minimum balance. As in your case, if the balance of the contingency drops below 25% of the annual operating budget, the strata corporation in the next fiscal year must contribute at least 10% of the annual operating budget value to the contingency fund.

If your annual budget is $400,000, and your contingency balance is below 25% or below $100,000, the contribution for your operating budget in the next fiscal year is a minimum of 10% of the proposed operating budget for the next fiscal year.

If the next year’s budget is $400,000, the minimum contribution in addition to the operating budget is $40,000.

The contingency reserve fund is intended to fund a variety of circumstances. Planned renewals recommended by the depreciation report, emergency repairs including emergency costs for insurance renewals, common insurance deductible costs, and approved costs for projects and costs approved by 3 / 4 vote of the owners at a general meeting.

Minimum funding is simply bad planning and deferral of the real value of strata fees. There will be times when a strata corporation significantly reduces their funds in cycles of repairs and maintenance or emergencies.

The key to planning is to ensure the future years ahead will be appropriately funded to reflect the projected renewals in your depreciation report and you approve sufficient funds in the annual budget to meet all your operations and service requirements.

The days of “keep your strata fees low so it doesn’t affect property values” are history.

Underfunded strata corporations are routinely identified as undermaintained properties. Low strata fees result in low contributions to the contingency fund which end up being frequent special levies for deferred repairs that are often delayed by defeated votes of the owners, and result in much more costly repairs and an increasing risk of insurance claims or serious implications on cost or limitations of insurance renewals.

There are many communities across B.C. that have implemented their deprecation reports actively for renewals planning and funding and have not required special levies for over 10 years, all due to prudent planning.

The additional administrative costs for collections of unpaid special levies consume a significant amount of strata council and management time and resources that may otherwise be dedicated toward the more critical tasks of maintenance, renewals, and operations. What is the right amount of funding?

Start with your depreciation report. What will you need in the next 10-20-30 years? Assess those values every year and that’s your starting place to determine your contributions.

In aging buildings the immediate costs may be out of everyone’s reach, but even a 50% increase in your contributions will make a significant difference in 10 years.

As it happened, my pot luck group met for the first time since before COVID, on one of the warmest evenings of the summer, two weeks ago. We agreed to meet early, at 6 p.m., on my back lawn.

I arranged six chairs and small tables, spaced a little more than two metres apart, in an arc facing the garden with a table at the centre for placing food. For safety, everyone brought her own plate, utensils, and drink. I supplied paper serviettes and a supplementary “drinks” table with water, wine, and hand sanitizer. The downstairs bathroom, just off the carport, was sanitized and supplied with small, individual towels.

Everyone contributed take-out food in the form of pizzas and sushi, and they all brought their own tongs or chopsticks for serving themselves. For dessert there were individual tarts from a local coffee shop.

It was a perfect evening, warm and fragrant. Some of the women strolled through the garden and returned with questions. One wanted to know the names of the flowers in a patch of wildflowers and bee-friendly blooms in one of the plots. She saw many of them as perfect for a small flower garden next to one of her apartment windows.

She began growing flowers in the site this year. Among the most promising ones Marilyn saw were alyssum, candytuft, cornflower, clarkia, and baby blue eyes (Nemophila).

Pat remarked on the hydrangeas in the garden and asked about a problem with her sister’s white hydrangea: Why were the blooms turning pink? The most likely reasons: It is common, as the blooms age, to take on pink tones. The acid-alkaline balance (pH) of the soil can also affect hydrangea flower colour. Alkaline soils foster pink and red. Acidic soils help to keep blue hydrangeas true blue. A soil that is very slightly acidic is probably best for white hydrangeas.

As the light was starting to fade, on came the evening entertainment — The Raccoon Show. A family of raccoons, a mother and four babies, began disporting themselves close by, in a big fir tree next to my side fence and very close to the house. The babies were trying to overtake each other along the branches as the whole lot of them made their way down the tree. They tumbled over the fence onto a slope beside the house, where we were able to observe their antics further.

That raccoon family has been the talk of the neighbourhood as it travels about. I often see them crossing the patio on their way back to their tree. One morning I watched the mother shepherding the little ones down my driveway toward the street.

Not my favourite wild animal, but part of the scene around here.

That was not the end of the evening’s entertainment. With the departure of my friends around dusk, I’d gone to bed and had just fallen asleep when a mighty noise jolted me awake. Thunder, as I’d never heard it before, followed repeated flashes of sheet lightning in a continuing “Sound and Light” exhibit that must have been a massive collision of weather systems — or a dog days show.

Tale of two clematis vines. A surprise this summer has been strong growth and flowers on two clematis vines that have, over the years, come close to disappearing into the landscape.

I first planted a Barbara Dibley on a trellis alongside the carport. When the trellis was removed, I transplanted the vine beside a flowering quince shrub a neighbour had given me. The vine lives and blooms, minimally, in a bed I tend only occasionally, but this summer, it proceeded to dot the top of the shrub liberally with its impressive mauve-pink, carmine-striped flowers.

I thought the Clematis durandii that I planted at the base of a Rosa rubrifolia (R. glauca) had disappeared, but it wound its way up the spiny rose canes to produce gorgeous indigo-blue flowers. Perhaps it was the severe renewal pruning of the rose in late winter, and the compost mulching that followed. Anyway, the flowers were a welcome gift."

So I would encourage people to check their credit report and make sure that everything on there looks right.""","TORONTO — Hundreds of thousands of Canadians have been negotiating with lenders over the past few months, hoping to hold off paying debt amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Now, those payments are beginning to filter through the credit reporting system.

article continues below

""We have seen the average number of accounts that are in a payment deferral status triple since before the pandemic,"" says Eva Wong, co-founder and chief operating officer of Borrowell, which offers free credit scores and reports.

""It shouldn't impact the credit score, but it should show up on the credit report.""

The Canadian Bankers Association said that as of June 30, 760,000 account holders had negotiated mortgage deferrals or skipped payments, while 445,000 had requested deferral for credit card debt.

According to Equifax, deferred payments — many agreed to as part of COVID-19 relief programs — don't harm borrowers' credit scores. But the payments must be reported in a certain way, and the status of these payments may not get reported to Equifax for up to 30 days.

It's important to make sure these deferred payments are reported correctly to credit bureaus, because even one false late payment can drop a credit score by as much as 150 points, says Wong. Credit scores are used not only by lenders, but also checked by cellphone carriers, employers and landlords, Wong says. Because it takes time to correct a credit score error, waiting until you ""need"" your high credit score is a risky move, she says.

""Depending on the type of error, the longer it persists, the more negative the impact,"" says Wong. ""If it's showing up as a late payment and it goes to month two, then it's two months of missed payments as opposed to just one. So I would encourage people to check their credit report and make sure that everything on there looks right.""

Anne Arbour, a financial educator at the Credit Counselling Society in Toronto, says that Canada's two credit-reporting agencies, Equifax Canada and TransUnion Canada, are data aggregators, and it is up to the lenders to create policies on how they report the deferred payments. It's important for consumers to get clear documentation of their agreement with their lender — such as a bank — when it comes to how they are reporting deferred payments, she says.

""Get as much detail from the lender, from the creditor, as possible about what a deferral will mean and what their practices as far as reporting it — so, whether it will impact somebody's rating or their score or not,"" says Arbour. ""And if there is any issue or concern, deal with the creditor first, getting as much written information as possible.""

Arbour noted that deferrals are not an automatic license to skip payments — not only must a formal agreement be struck, but many lenders may have explicit instructions on how interest or even late fees accrues while payments are halted.

Taylor Little, chief of Vancouver-based alternative lender, Neighbourhood Holdings, says that many people skipped payments based on reading about deferral programs, without actually checking to make sure whether the lender was offering deferrals or some other type of payment plan instead. Doing that can hurt a credit score, and likely won't be counted as an error, he says.

When checking with lenders, Arbour says people should collect a copy of the agreement, a file ID or reference number, and the name of the agent with whom they spoke, in case this information is needed to file a credit score dispute down the road.

If a consumer notices something that might be wrong on their credit score —such as a deferred payment being counted as ""late"" — the lender is once again the first stop, she says.

""Going back to the creditor themselves is a good first step,"" she says. ""[Equifax and TransUnion] have worked closely with the Canadian Bankers Association, with the lenders, everybody to try and come up with a way to report any deferrals, whether it was mortgages or credit cards, in a way that wouldn't penalize the consumer. But the onus ultimately was on and is on the creditors to change their systems.""

In addition to requesting a fix from the lender, consumers can ask Equifax or TransUnion to investigate a mismarked payment, through a credit report update form or investigation request form. Separately, consumers can also now put a ""consumer statement"" to a credit report to signal to lenders that something is being disputed. Equifax Canada gives an example: ""Be advised that the negative accounts on my credit report are related to the Covid-19 pandemic. I intend to make these up as soon as I can find a job.""

Keeping on top of errors — and being quick to correct them if they happen — is easier if consumers stick with a routine and understand the parts of the credit scoring process, says Arbour. For example, free services that offer credit monitoring offer more frequent updates and are different from Equifax or TransUnion's free yearly reports. Those annual reports from Equifax or TransUnion are also different from the formal scores checked by lenders in a ""hard"" credit check, she says.

She advised that consumers can take advantage of both credit monitoring services and free yearly reports.

""There's no sort of one size fits all answer — very often mortgages don't actually appear on credit reports,"" says Arbour. ""[Mismarked deferrals] haven't been brought up as a concern just yet. . . . I think come September, it might be a different story. Once deferrals are over, unless people are checking their credit report, they won't notice it unless they're in a situation where they're having to renew their term or renegotiate a rate or a debt management program.""

There are several sure indicators of the seeds being ready for harvesting. First, the plump, upright seed capsules should be fully dry. Holes should have opened up immediately below the neat little disk that tops the capsule. The final sign is a free rattling of the seeds within the capsule when it is shaken gently.

I harvest the capsules by cutting them off carefully and depositing them into a paper bag, which I then store in a dry, dark, cool place until I’m ready to extract the seeds. This is done by upending each capsule and shaking it, as you would a salt shaker, over a clean, dry container.

Dear Helen: What were the rusty markings on my garlic plants? The bulbs themselves seem all right, though they are smaller than those I harvested last year. I did not compost the tarnished tops.

B.D.

Cool, wet weather through early July made our garlic plantings (and many other plants) highly vulnerable to an array of diseases. One of them is garlic rust, a fungus that causes rusty orange specks on the foliage. Upon digging the bulbs, you made the right choice to destroy the infected leaves.

Effects of the disease on the harvested bulbs are minimal. They should store well. The infection can reduce the bulb size, but this year’s home garden bulbs have generally been smaller than the supersized bulbs many of us harvested last year.

Watch for rust on other onion family plants in the garden. Leeks and chives are examples. Get rid of any infected plants by late autumn, before they can transfer disease spores to any extra-early green garlic shoots, which sometimes appear early in the winter.

Another key disease prevention measure is to wait four years before planting garlic or any other onion family plant in a space. Dormant disease spores eventually die in the absence of a host.

Every year, in late summer, I make a rough sketch of the vegetable garden with all the major plant types positioned on it. I keep them on a clipboard for easy access to individual planting sites over recent years. Those pages are a helpful guide to keeping plantings moved carefully around from year to year.

Dear Helen: For two years now, paper wasps have built nests in my greenhouse. They are not at all aggressive and their small nests are interesting. Are they native insects, and beneficial?

W.S.

That depends on the kind of paper wasp you have. The European paper wasp is considered invasive, and damaging to fruit and berry crops. It builds small, papery, umbrella-shaped nests on eaves, porch ceilings and similar locations as well as in trees and shrubs. These insects have black and yellow stripes similar to yellow jacket wasps, but the bodies are more elongated with a narrow, pinched-in waist.

Native paper wasps are more golden in colour, with more elongated, thinner waists. They are considered beneficial as pollinators and pest predators.

You will find descriptions and colour photos of European and native paper wasps, and of yellow jackets, at beefriendly.ca/paper-wasp-nests/. The nests of all three are also pictured.

Dear Helen: Why did all the early flowers on my strong and healthy heirloom tomato plants dry up without any fruit forming?

A.M.

Tomatoes and other warmth-loving plants did not fare well in the unusually cool and wet, almost fall-like late spring and early summer weather this year. I’ve heard from many gardeners whose melon plants expired in the daunting conditions, which also made successful pollination of tomato flowers more than challenging.

Many, but not all, heirloom tomato varieties need a long season of sun and warmth to yield a successful crop. And they demand near perfect conditions for a good fruit set.

Having said that, I should note that my heirloom Japanese Black Trifele tomato plants developed fruit from the very first blossoms, low down on the plants. Those first fruits ripened a week ago. This variety is an unusually easy-growing, prolific producer of tomatoes with a rich flavour.

Your tomatoes most likely began forming fruit with the arrival of warm weather, but because of the late start some of our plants may prove disappointing this summer."

It's an opportune time for an update to this lavishly illustrated history of gardening and landscaping. ""The Story of Gardening"" might sit (heavily) on a coffee table, but it transports the reader out into the yard or the park with some new perspectives and ambitions.

article continues below

We all appreciate green space more than ever these days. As always, gardens offer the promise of beauty, serenity, artistry and practicality. They're also a relatively safe place to spend time, and gardening as a pursuit has taken off in the age of coronavirus.

""We can picture the garden-owner gradually beginning to derive pride, status and pleasure from the plot that it was within his power to make fertile and beautiful,"" write the authors, Penelope Hobhouse and Ambra Edwards, imagining humankind’s very first gardens. They could just as well be describing many people this summer.

The authors show gardening to be an age-old struggle to appreciate and amplify nature’s beauty while also imposing order on it. It’s about finding a balance, too, between what looks good and what is practical.

""The Story of Gardening"" begins in the Fertile Crescent and travels around the world and up to the present. For those of us wondering what to do with our yards and gardens next year, there might be inspiration in seeing how different cultures have approached layout and plantings, from Islamic walled gardens to the ""power-gardening"" formalism of French royalty to the more naturalistic English cottage gardens to pared-down Japanese gardens and more.

The American idea of the endless front lawn, one rolling into another, was an attempt to democratize the landscape, doing away with the walls and formal plantings of colonial estates, the authors say.

A new final chapter includes recent projects, including New York City’s High Line and Piet Oudolf’s sweeping meadows of grasses and perennials, and focuses on sustainability, ecology and other gardening concerns today.

There will be flowers to cut, fruits to gather and savour, process and store away. Though its fresh, spring-like youth has passed by, the garden’s “middle age” and maturing cycle brings its own rewards.

We could say of the garden what Keith Richards (of the Rolling Stones) proclaimed in a documentary on his life: “I’m not aging. I’m evolving.”

As the garden evolves into its late summer season and beyond, it yields gifts of sun-ripened tomatoes and cucumbers, squashes, leeks and kale, brilliant hydrangeas, fragrant lilies, and full-headed sunflowers.

As I walk through the August garden, Robert Browning’s poem Rabbi Ben Ezra comes to mind:

“Grow old along with me!

The best is yet to be,

The last of life, for which the first was made”

All the planning and preparation, seeding and transplanting done early in a gardening season is rewarded later with many pleasures as the garden “evolves.” It’s a time for me to revisit longtime favourite dishes that bring back old memories as they deliver fine summer flavours.

There’s a broad bean salad in a lemon juice, olive oil, garlic and salt dressing, with cooked broad beans joined by sweet red pepper, onion, chopped raw zucchini and feta cheese.

With the first sun-warmed, ripe tomatoes I anticipate a garlic and basil flavoured, uncooked tomato sauce over hot spaghetti, dusted with freshly grated parmesan cheese.

Every summer, zucchini are transformed into a tart with onion, eggs and cream in a recipe I learned to make in Italy. And during a year I spent in a tiny Greek village I observed what was called a “Middle Eastern” salad being made with cucumber chopped into a yoghurt mixture.

First, yoghurt was placed in a bowl and drizzled with a little olive oil. Fresh lemon juice was added next, along with salt and a generous amount of mashed garlic. Finally, the cucumber. What a wonderfully tangy way to enjoy the summer’s cucumbers. My daughter often mentions how she loved it as a child.

This poppy is called Black Swan Lace.

Perpetual poppies. It was a warm weekend morning late last month when two neighbours rang the doorbell and asked to walk through the garden. Karen, on a week’s leave from coast guard duty, had not yet been through the garden this summer.

They sampled raspberries and gathered a few broad beans, which they had never eaten, to try, but Karen was clearly most drawn to the big poppy seed heads. She is fond of the seeds as toppings for bagels and as ingredients in muffins and breads. Most of the peony-flowered poppies (Papaver somniferum) had dropped their petals and were in the process of ripening the black seeds that are used in baking.

These poppies, both single and double flowered, commonly appear in gardens, and self-sow to return each year. A double-flowered pink bloom is common, as is a pale mauve form with deep rosy purple blotches. Every year seems to bring its own assortment of colours. This year, several peach-coloured poppies flowered in the garden.

Every few years I add to the gene pool by choosing and seeding a new variety. This year, I grew Black Swan Lace, an unusual fine-petalled flower in deep burgundy-black. The seed was from Brother Nature Seeds in Victoria.

Tanya’s berry parfait. When I invited a neighbour to have dinner with me late in July, she volunteered to bring dessert. What she created was a visual and flavour-filled seasonal delight.

Tanya brought individual, layered desserts, in glasses. Over a thin layer of graham cracker crumbs was a blend of yoghurt thickened with a little cream cheese, sweetened with maple syrup and flavoured with lemon juice and zest.

The next layer was blueberry sauce, also sweetened with maple syrup and flavoured with lemon. Tanya thickened the sauce with cornstarch (dissolved in a little water).

The sauce was covered with more of the yogurt mixture topped with a dusting of graham cracker crumbs and garnished with fresh berries. The individual desserts had been chilled in the fridge for about two hours.

Tanya and I share a preference for minimally sweet desserts. This dessert is light, fresh and versatile. It can be made using any garden fruit or berry, fresh or in sauce form."

R.M.

article continues below

Fragrance will vary with the weather, the age of the blooms and the time of day. I often sniff-test the petunias on my patio. I grow the most fragrant ones I know of, and place them by the screened patio door that I open on summer mornings and evenings. They are at their most fragrant in warmth, and the fully opened flowers are more perfumed that newly opened and fading ones.

Dear Helen: How can I tell whether the raspberries in the garden of a house I bought are summer-bearing or “everbearing”?

K.P.

Several of my neighbours have recently asked me the same question. Gardeners often pass along raspberry canes to friends without informing them about the variety. “Summer bearing” raspberries have one harvest season, in July. The berries are borne on canes that developed in the previous year. Canes that have finished producing berries are cut down to allow the new canes that will bear the next year’s crop to mature well. Crowded canes are thinned out.

Everbearing raspberries give an early summer crop and another in late summer to early autumn. They will have wound up their first harvesting period now, and will have begun developing flower buds at the tips of this year’s new canes for the second crop.

That’s how you can identify the two-crop “ever-bearers.” Flower buds begin developing on the new canes in late July and early August.

Managing ever-bearers: Cut down the old, browning canes that produced the early summer berries. When the late-season crop on the new canes has been harvested, cut those canes back to just below the tops that produced berries. Next year’s early raspberries will be produced on the cane portions below where you have cut.

Many people simply cut down all the everbearing canes at winter’s end. That eliminates the early summer berries. New canes that grow in the spring will give only the one, late-season crop.

I don’t do that because I prize the early summer berries and the late-season crop often coincides with early autumn rains that turn the berries mouldy.

Dear Helen: I would like to try growing winter vegetables this year. I’m not sure what I can start from seed or transplants at this time. Are transplants widely available?

G.W.

You will find some winter vegetable transplants at most garden centres. They usually begin arriving in late July or early August. A few phone calls to your favourite local outlets should unearth sources.

You will find transplants of cold-hardy lettuces, kale, winter cabbage, and over-wintering cauliflower and sprouting broccoli. Seeds can be planted outdoors now of spinach, winter lettuces, arugula, mizuna (a spicy Asian green with feathery leaves) and corn salad.

Dear Helen: This is going to seem crazy, but as I was digging over a previously uncultivated patch of ground last month, I heard a distinct hissing sound coming from the soil. A bit of poking around unearthed a large beetle with lines on its back. More hissing emanated from the beetle. Have you ever heard of anything like this?

A.D.

Over the years, I have dug up many beetles similar to the one you describe, in varying stages of their maturity. The creature is a tenlined June beetle. The adult beetles usually emerge from the soil in June to mate and lay eggs. The cold weather delayed most of the emergence until July this year. Not long ago I dug up several that were just on the verge of taking flight — the precise stage at which they seem to make that odd bellows-like wheezing sound when disturbed.

Favoured egg-laying places are in the roots of grasses. The eggs hatch to produce plump, C-shaped larvae that live in the soil for three to four years before reaching the adult stage. They are found in the greatest numbers where lawns and grassy fields have been dug up to plant gardens. Then, they can cause some damage to plant roots and potato tubers.

I watch for the whitish, curved grubs and remove them as I dig plots. Turning over the soil a few times before planting helps to expose larvae that you miss to birds and other predators."

A recent decision to eliminate the landscape contractor resulted in a ground-floor flood last week, as the irrigation system was not being maintained through July, which was a routine part of the schedule maintenance and servicing. The flood resulting from chronic leaking sprinkler head that was reported to council in early July was not addressed until an owner reported their patio filling with water. The damage to the strata lot was nothing more than a wet carpet, but as a strata council member, at what point do we the council and the corporation start to take on liability for bad business decisions? Council has basically taken the position that it will address problems as they arise.

As a property owner and council member, you have the legislated obligation under the Strata Property Act to maintain and repair common property and common assets. Your owners also approved a budget including landscaping services, which is also a lawful instruction to implement the contracts wherever possible. Regardless of the size or type of a strata corporation, annual operations plans are the best method to ensure the obligations of inspection, maintenance and repairs are implemented. An operations plan will summarize the components and assets of your strata corporation, which can easily be converted from your deprecation report, and identify what level of service or inspection and maintenance are required as part of your annual operations, and what components or systems are managed on a long-term basis.

If your strata corporation fails to maintain common property and common assets, and an owner suffers a loss, the owner is likely in a position to seek damages against the strata corporation either through the courts or the civil resolution tribunal. If you have failures relating to building systems or assets that result in insurance claims, your insurance provider is likely going to advise you of this risk, put you on notice of increased costs for claims or advise you of their inability to renew your insurance. Common areas of neglect for strata corporations are drainage and sanitary systems, roofing systems and electrical systems. Most items that are out of sight are often not a priority, but these key components often result in avoidable claims and damages, and a significant disruption to owners. Sanitary lines and drains for example, should be flushed professionally at least every three years if not more frequently. Likely due to the increased occupancy periods this year with the pandemic restrictions, there has also been an increase in sewer backups, but the most common attributable factor is simply aging building systems that are neglected.

Sewer backup is one of the most severe problems, and accessing buildings during the lock down is a greater problem, as the plumbing contractor will require access to strata lots as well.

General inspection and maintenance of operational building components is the best method to prevent losses, claims, unnecessary damages and, in many cases, often extend the life of building components. Roofing systems cover 100% of our investments, yet most property owners undertake inspection or maintenance on an annual basis. A qualified inspector or roofer can identify deficiencies and damages that can be easily and quickly addressed to ensure good performance of the roofing system and extend the life of the roofing system if routine service is conducted.

Routine maintenance of hot-water boilers will extend the life of the boilers and ensure they are performing at their best efficiency levels reducing energy consumption and cost. If your roof fails, this is now an emergency repair. Damages have been caused, the cost for after hours response is significant and the repair is short term rather than a co-ordinated approach to maintenance and renewals. The attitude of waiting until a component fails before we have to fix it is a false economy.

Create a schedule of all your building components and determine what services you require and the frequency of servicing. For more information on operations plans and samples, go to choa.bc.ca and view the webinar on operations plans.

Lucky you is right. Furnishings and accessories that we inherit don’t always suit our style. But sometimes they teach us something about ourselves that we might not have known.

Instead of thinking about how the turquoise chair doesn’t work, ask yourself if you like it. That’s the key. If so, experiment with ways that it could fit.

It is natural for most of us to be timid about colour. Especially strong colour. That chair demands to be noticed. Just like a red dress or bright yellow shirt says here I am, look at me. There is nothing wrong with strutting your colour. And it can be done in such a way as to not overwhelm you or your space.

That red dress would be more flattering with a pastel pink scarf to soften the effect. What about white pants with the yellow blouse? And for your chair, in a cheerful and stylish bedroom, pale tones of buttery yellow on the walls and cool shades of green on the bed soften and balance the strength of the turquoise as shown here from thespruce.com.

Decorate around a bold colour with neutrals taking most of the wall space. The bedlinens are also neutral, but the glorious turquoise pops up as part of the design on the curtains and a throw cushion.

Until you are used to the chair, drape a light yellow or green blanket over the back. Or add a cushion. Enjoy your inheritance. I bet it will soon be your favourite piece.

Dear Debbie: I am a bit of a hoarder, not crazy yet but I do have difficulty finding ways to make my rooms look reasonably neat. My partner has just moved in and I feel a crisis coming on. How do I manage the mess?

Lillah

Choose a bookcase that will enhance your room as well as the items you have selected to display.

You know what I’m going to say: To begin with, do a purge. Painful at first but once you take a good look at what you are saving you will discover that you just don’t need or want all that stuff. And what a perfect way to welcome your partner.

Next is to create places for storing and viewing what you really do care for. A good set of shelves, one for each room, will get you started. Group together collections that tell your story like the pieces you have saved for a reason. Whether it’s books, miniature cars, old perfume bottles or postcards, display them so you can enjoy the memories.

If it’s something larger like posters, paper a wall with them. Is it shoes? Line them up along the bedroom wall. I’ve never understood the need to hide away what we hold dear no matter what it is. Then ask your partner to do the same.

Choose shelving that enhances your stories. Floating shelves promote an airy feeling, good for a minimalist vibe. Wooden shelves with wrought iron brackets are country style.

They have refused to grant permission for the removal of a section of wall between the units, even though we have obtained a structural engineering report and a building permit for the work. The wall is not structural and does not contain any services, such as plumbing or venting, that could affect our two units or another strata lot.

This was a significant investment intended to raise our family in an affordable setting and has turned into a disaster. Are there some options to force the strata council to co-operate with our request and resolve this?

Maria and George C., Vancouver

Strata corporations are naturally reluctant to allow the removal of walls between units or above and below units.

There are many buyers who try to flip units quickly by doing quick-fix alterations and changes. Then the next buyer comes along and discovers there are problems with mechanical services, the walls were, in fact, structural and supporting, the ventilation has significantly changed or the plumbing — water delivery or drainage — has been altered.

Both the new owner and the strata corporation are often left with damages and liability to remedy the unauthorized alterations.

Owners who want to remove all or part of a wall that is a common boundary between two strata lots require the written approval of the strata corporation.

Provided the owner complies with building regulations and any applicable municipal or regional bylaws, and does not interfere with the provision of utilities or other services to any other strata lot or common property, and provides copies of any required building permits to the strata corporation, the strata corporation must grant the permission.

Documents and plans certified by an engineer that verify the scope of the work in detail, address building-code requirements, and include the required building permits would be a minimal standard for a strata council to request.

If the strata council does not act reasonably, Strata Property Act provisions can be enforced with an application through the Civil Resolution Tribunal.

It would be beneficial to request a hearing with the strata council, which can be conducted electronically. You may wish to retain a lawyer to be present at your hearing to determine what conditions, if any, are not being met, or if the strata is simply refusing to comply with the act.

The unit entitlement or size of the two strata lots remains the same, as well as the voting rights of one vote per strata lot. There is no increase in strata fees, as the habitable area of each strata lot has not been changed. As the owner, you continue to pay the same strata fee entitlement for the two strata lots.

Any other changes within the strata lot, such as removal of a kitchen or update or remodelling of bathrooms or internal walls and rooms, all require the permission of the strata corporation. Detailed drawings and plans should be provided to help the strata council make a decision.

Changes to electrical systems, plumbing and ventilation can also have a significant effect on the use and enjoyment of other strata lots.

During the COVID-19 restrictions, many strata corporations are encouraging owners to delay alterations to strata lots to reduce construction activity within their buildings and reduce the transiency of contractors and trades.

The level of caution your strata council is exercising is prudent; however, under normal conditions, they do have an obligation to grant permission within a timely manner.

That’s been a common issue this year. One of my neighbours pulled up and composted all her cauliflower plants because the heads had taken on purplish tones. Too bad, because they were perfectly safe to eat.

Cauliflower is highly heat-sensitive. Most plants thrived in our long, cool, moist spring and early summer, but the sudden onset of heat and strong sunlight has caused in some plants the common reaction of purple colouring.

Certain varieties, such as the popular Snow Crown, are more susceptible than others. I’ve had Snow Crown heads become tinged with purple or purplish-pink in hot, sunny weather.

Dear Helen: I was interested in your descriptions of dense, close-space planting to make the best use of a limited area. I have experimented with planting like this and found watering can be challenging. The dense foliage canopy of substantial plants such as tomatoes, broccoli and pea vines tends to divert water away from the plants’ roots. How do you manage to keep the root areas of closely spaced plants moist?

A.T.

Soaker hoses laid between the rows is one way to keep the sheltered soil watered. I use a more hands-on method.

To reach in and give a gentle but thorough dousing of the soil between two four-metre pea vine rows and between a pea row and another of staked tomatoes, with just a one-metre space between the rows, I’ve used a long-handled watering wand with an on-off lever.

That first pea planting is finished and removed now and I’m picking the second planting, but the narrow alley between the peas and tomatoes is easily kept well moistened, at ground level, with my handy extra-long watering wand.

To some, such a method might seem antiquated and inefficient, yet the time spent wielding that wand is somehow easeful.

I treasure such blessedly undemanding tasks. They are sublime opportunities let the gaze wander, listen to the bees humming, and rest the mind.

Dear Helen: Quite a few years ago, you shared a recipe for lavender cookies. I used that recipe so much, my copy has become unreadable. Could you repeat it? I love these cookies and they are a favourite of my family and friends.

T.W.

Lavender shortbread

1 1/2 cups butter at room temperature

2/3 cup sugar

2 Tbsp chopped lavender florets

1 Tbsp chopped fresh mint

2 1/3 cups flour

1/2 cup corn starch

1/4 tsp salt

Cream butter and sugar. Add lavender and mint. Mix until light and fluffy, about three minutes. Add flour, corn starch and salt. Beat until combined.

Divide the dough in half, flatten into squares, and wrap in plastic. Chill until firm. On a floured board, roll or pat out each square to a thickness of 3/8 inch. Cut the dough into 1 1/2-inch squares or rounds, and transfer to baking sheets that are covered with parchment or brown paper. Space them one inch apart, and prick each cookie several times with the tines of a fork.

Bake 20 to 25 minutes at 325 F, until pale golden. Do not allow the shortbread to brown.

Cool slightly, transfer to a rack, sprinkle with lavender powdered sugar if you wish, and store in sealed containers.

Lavender powdered sugar is made by putting a few lavender flowers in a sealed pint jar of powdered sugar for a day before using the sugar.

The plants were all self-sown variations of rose campion (Lychnis coronaria), a short-lived perennial that has produced new plants from seed every year, throughout the garden, ever since I planted a form called Angel’s Blush years ago.

The standard rose campion species is a familiar plant with dense clumps of velvety, silver-grey foliage and multi-branched stems bearing bright magenta-pink blooms. Like most species, L. coronaria doesn’t always produce flowers in a common, uniform colour. Seed growers over the years have selected certain variations and propagated them to produce a distinct strain.

Most of the flowers on my self-sown boulevard plants this year are white, some with vestiges of the pink blushing characteristic of my original Angel’s Blush seeding. One plant bears the usual deep magenta pink blooms of the species.

One man stopped his truck beside the boulevard and asked permission to photograph the white-flowered rose campion for his mother, a keen gardener. They’d never seen rose campion with white blooms.

The British company Chiltern Seeds lists the species, along with Angel’s Blush and Alba — the white-flowering form. J.L. Hudson (California) also lists Alba, as White Campion. Angel’s Blush is sometimes named L. coronaria Oculata.

Most mainstream catalogues no longer list this historic Mediterranean flower. Two more sources are Brother Nature Seeds in Victoria and Florabunda Seeds in Ontario.

Abundance. Until almost mid-month, cool temperatures and frequent rains created waves of lush green in our gardens. Everything grew profusely. I’ve never had such plump, juicy lettuces. The frilly endive has been flavourful, with no bitterness.

Potato tops grew uncommonly long. Spinach and beet greens were luxuriant. Cabbage family vegetables grew wonderfully robust in the cool weather. And the peas have been magic.

My first double row of peas, seeded mid-March, produced a mass of pods on thick-stemmed vines. A first picking, on July 1, yielded seven cups of blanched peas for the freezer. After a series of follow-up pickings I had frozen 25 cups of the peas. That did not include the ones I’d consumed fresh.

Now those vines are lifted, chopped and composted, and the second double, four-metre row has begun to yield filled pods. That first double row grew, like the second one, on wire fencing in a space one by four metres. The same space delivered around 10 lettuces that developed from transplants placed along the pea vine bases. That’s a fairly substantial yield of food from the limited space.

Along the south side of the same rectangular plot, another four-metre length of wire fencing supports a dozen staked tomato plants and two cucumber vines, with sweet potatoes growing in a strip on the south side of the tomatoes.

That space, four by 1.2 metres, promises a good yield of food if the weather warms sufficiently.

Delayed development. While cool growing plants flourished through late spring and early summer, others did not. Fruit set has been delayed on open garden tomatoes. Two of my three Sugar Baby watermelon transplants shivered into oblivion. The one remaining began expanding earlier in the month atop a partially “finished” compost heap, but it might be too late now for fruit set and ripening.

With warm, sunny weather, tomatoes should begin to develop fruits more normally, but varieties requiring a long, warm summer to ripen may prove disappointing this year. My Big Beef, Arbason and Japanese Trifele Black plants have swelling fruit.

There are plenty of small tomatoes on the potted patio varieties, though the plants have grown larger than they usually do. Fruits are developing on the potted miniature peppers.

The regular, full-sized cucumber plants have struggled, and bear only tiny fruits, but the two mini-cucumber varieties I’m growing have been more than gratifying.

I ate my first 13-centimetre cucumber from a Picolino (West Coast Seeds) vine on July 13 and the first from Green Light (T&T Seeds) the next day. The trained (upward) Green Light vines are as tall as I am. The vines are robust, with large, deep green leaves.

My friends had been raving about the greenhouse-grown mini-cucumbers sold at our local farmers’ market. Their comments prompted me to grow my own."

Last month marked the highest monthly sales figure on record, the Canadian Real Estate Association reported, while the national average sales price jumped to a record $571,500.

Part of the fuel behind rising prices has been driven by a change in the real estate cycle, RBC senior economist Robert Hogue said during an RBC podcast earlier this month.

Traditionally, many homebuyers and sellers wait until spring to make deals as snowfall hampers curb appeal. This year, all of the usual spring homebuying fever was pushed into the usually slow summer months as people emerged from lockdown.

Under normal circumstances, real estate agents expect a busy period in early fall as people try to finish their move before winter.

Rachel Gagnon, an Ottawa-based real estate broker at Ian Charlebois & Associates Real Estate & Mortgages, said the demand for housing has stemmed from ""stay at home"" orders, which left people wishing for more space and amenities.

""Unless a major, and I mean very major, shift was to happen, which would create an influx of properties on the market, things will continue to move as they have over the last few months,"" she said.

""As we move forward through August and September, people work through the new school rules, I think we'll see a fairly large uptick in activity. Unless a second wave shifts things dramatically, I think we're going to have a very busy fall market that won't slow down until the Christmas season.""

But Gagnon also said that she has seen the pressure placed on first-time homebuyers, who are trying to get into the market now while they can afford a mortgage, even if it maxes out their borrowing power.

And COVID-19 related travel restrictions have led to slowing immigration and less demand from property buyers seeking rental properties for tourists or students.

The uncertainty means a fall slowdown is possible, said Bethany King, a team leader at Century 21 Millennium Inc. Brokerage in Brampton, Ont.

While some lenders are offering cash back, lending expectations have also changed, said King. For example, some lenders consider essential workers to have better job security should a second COVID-19 wave come.

Fear about a ""second wave"" in the fall has parents planning to save money, in case children are sent home and parents need to cut back hours and income to focus on caregiving, she said.

""Those are the things that have investors who are regular people — not millionaires that have tons and tons of properties, and are cashing out — preparing for the worst,"" King said.

Kean Birch, an associate professor at York University, said he will be watching for the extension or end of mortgage payment deferrals.

""I find it worrying that housing prices are continuing to rise. The reason being that we don't know what's going to happen once the mortgage payment deferral ends, and the consequences actually could be dramatic across the board. And it could be highly inequitable as well,"" said Birch, who studies economic geography.

Evan Siddall, chief executive of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., wrote a letter earlier this month that said he expects house prices to fall, ""even in the face of recent activity, which appears to be the result of very low interest rates and a sharp reduction in new listings.""

""Our projections always anticipated a delayed impact: weakening in late 2020 and 2021 once government income supports unwind,"" read the letter.

However, Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centres, called CMHC's forecast is ""overly pessimistic.""

""Here we are in the second half of 2020, and the national average sales price has risen 14.3 per cent year-over-year,"" she said.

""The good news is that the housing market is contributing to the recovery in economic activity.""

Transport Canada data obtained by The Canadian Press this week shows 75 per cent of the $300-million program has already been spoken for, just 15 months into its three-year mandate.

article continues below

The rebate, which provides up to $5,000 back on the purchase or lease of a new battery vehicle, or a battery-gasoline hybrid one, began May 1, 2019, and was supposed to run until April 30, 2022.

But as of July 31, more than $225 million had been paid out to 53,510 drivers.

""It's no surprise to me,"" said Daniel Breton, president of Electric Mobility Canada, a non-profit agency pushing for the electrification of transportation.

Electric car sales, as a share of overall vehicle purchases, have steadily grown from two per cent of all sales in 2018 to three per cent last year, and to almost four per cent in the first three months of 2020.

But the rate of uptake is heavily concentrated in just three provinces. Quebec and British Columbia, which have sales quotas for electric cars and provincial rebates on top of the federal one, together account for 86 per cent of all the rebates.

Ontario, which had a provincial rebate until 2019, accounted for another 12 per cent, with the remaining two per cent divided among the other seven provinces and the territories.

Breton said the additional provincial rebate makes buying electric cars more attractive in Quebec and B.C. but car makers are also shipping more electric cars there because their dealers have quotas for sales. Availability of electric models is limited, and many drivers have to wait weeks or months for one.

Electric Mobility Canada wants Ottawa to expand the program to include used cars and to increase the maximum purchase price of the cars that qualify for a rebate. SUVs and pickup trucks, which are more expensive, are set to come onto the market. In 2019, almost three in every four passenger vehicles sold were SUVs and pickups.

Cara Clairman, CEO of the non-profit advocacy group Plug'n Drive, says she hopes Ottawa will provide more money for rebates when the current allotment runs out because they are making a difference.

""I think we do need a few more years of it,"" she said. ""You have to look at it as a climate-change program.""

Canada has set targets to have 10 per cent of all passenger vehicles sold be electric by 2025, 30 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2040. Breton said that won't happen if the rebate isn't expanded.

Breton is also looking for the rebates to be extended to used electric and hybrid vehicles, which are now more easy to find than new ones in many cases. A 10-per-cent rebate on the purchase of a used electric car was mentioned in the mandate letter for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains last fall but has not yet been announced.

Transport Minister Marc Garneau was instructed in his mandate letter to do more to make the electric car sales quotas. Before the pandemic, he indicated he was looking at what more to do, including extending or expanding the rebate program. Something was expected in the March federal budget, delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Garneau's spokeswoman was noncommittal Thursday when asked if the rebate program would be expanded.

""This specific program continues and consumers are able to make use of the incentive,"" Livia Belcea said in an email. ""Any changes in funding for the program would be reviewed at the appropriate time and as needed.""

""It's very convenient. We're in every community. The other plus is they don't have to line up with people who may have symptoms. We've shared that with Ontario and with other provinces, so at this point we’re looking forward to what they may decide,"" Firestone said.

London Drugs also conducts COVID-19 tests in Alberta. It began offering the service at six locations during the past two weeks and plans to roll it out at nine more by October. Like Shoppers, it bills Alberta Health Services for testing costs.

The service builds on other responses to the pandemic such as online pharmacist consultations and a pilot program where patients consult virtually with doctors in a private room in the store.

London Drugs is among the pharmacy retailers beefing up their role in a health-care system grappling with an aging population.

""With the extended hours of operation, you can basically go in when our stores are open and be able to find a pharmacist to ask a question. So what we’re able to do at that point is basically help triage the system,"" said Chris Chiew, head of pharmacy at the Richmond, B.C.-based retailer.

London Drugs has also hired diabetes educators to test blood sugar levels and assist patients with weight management and diet.

Shoppers has stepped even further into the realm of physicians, opening one of three planned medical clinics with doctors who cater to a roster of patients and walk-in services.

""There are a number of Canadians who don’t have access to a family physician. And we thought there was an opportunity for us to really play a role here in terms of access,"" Firestone said.

Drugstores can also handle the bureaucratic side of health care, freeing up doctors to spend more time with patients, she said.

""Looking for PPE (personal protective equipment), sorting out their waiting rooms so that people are socially distanced, managing virtual care...we’re able to take that burden on for them,"" Firestone said.

In 2018, Shoppers launched its Wellwise store chain to sell assisted-living devices aimed at older Canadians. More recently, it began to offer tips and videos online designed to help ward off depression and anxiety.

Metro Inc. declined to comment on any attempts to provide COVID-19 testing. The bulk of the company's Jean Coutu drugstores are located in Quebec, which unlike some provinces does not allow pharmacists to conduct testing via nose and mouth swabs.

The Bank of Nova Scotia's profit was weighed down in its latest quarter by mounting provisions for bad loans and its Latin American operations. The Toronto-based bank revealed Tuesday that its third-quarter profit slipped to $1.3 billion from $1.98 billion a year ago, while its provisions for credit losses totalled $2.18 billion for the quarter, up from $1.85 billion last quarter and $713 million in the year prior. ""We know that structural damage has been done to the economy. It's going to require a lot of quarters of clean up from here, but we do view this quarter's PCL as our high-water mark,"" Daniel Moore, the bank's chief risk officer, said during a conference call with financial analysts.

Bank of Montreal (TSX:BMO). Up $4.38 cents, or 5.7 per cent, to $81.23. BMO Financial Group put aside a hefty amount of money again to protect itself from bad loans even as it posted a $1.23-billion profit in its latest quarter. The Toronto-based bank said Tuesday that provisions for credit losses amounted to $1.05 billion in its third quarter, up from $306 million last year and down from $1.11 billion last quarter. Patrick Cronin, the bank's chief risk officer, attributed the high provisions to the COVID-19 pandemic, but said he has confidence in the bank's ability to operate in such an environment.

The Canadian Association of Broadcasters issued a report on Wednesday warning of potential closures and widespread job cuts as private TV and radio broadcasters face a cumulative projected revenue shortfall of up to $1.06 billion by the end of 2022.

Most vulnerable are the country's AM radio stations, the report said, as well as other independent private radio and TV operations in smaller markets across the country.

The study, titled ""The Crisis in Canadian Media and the Future of Local Broadcasting,"" was commissioned by the CAB, which represents the majority of private broadcasters in Canada, and conducted through Winnipeg-based independent media economics consultancy Communications Management Inc.

The CAB says it's concerned about the fallout from a substantial erosion in local advertising revenues over recent months.

Radio stations may be hardest hit in the short term, the report suggests, partly due to many advertisers pulling back on their spending in the pandemic and hastening a decline in the media industry's revenues.

Private radio ad revenues are expected to be $383 million below last year, it said.

The report's projections suggest that without further government support those declines could mean as many as 50 private local radio stations go out of business over the next four to six months.

The CAB is calling on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to take swift action by establishing a ""more fair and sustainable future"" for local media.

Last month, the organization sent an emergency application to the CRTC requesting permission for broadcasters to be relieved of certain terms of their agreements, such as spending requirements on Canadian programming, for the broadcast year that ends Aug. 31.

Lenore Gibson, chair of the CAB, said broadcasters have ""done their utmost to cut expenses"" in areas such as administration, and ""the last thing that they want to do is cut into programming costs, but that's the only area that's left now.""

The CAB is urging the federal government to provide emergency regulatory relief as well as greater ""targeted support"" for the industry starting this fall.

Without greater financial measures in place, the CAB says the effects could leave many communities with only national and international media organizations to provide them with most of their news, effectively eliminating most community coverage of local politics, health and education in some regions of the country.

Bo Horvat scored twice, and Tyler Toffoli and Elias Pettersson each had a goal and two assists as the Canucks defeated the Golden Knights 5-2 at Rogers Place.

article continues below

The best-of-seven second-round series is tied 1-1. Game 3 goes Thursday.

Forty-eight hours earlier, the Golden Knights, now 8-2 in the post-season, had manhandled the Canucks en route to a 5-0 pounding in Game 1.

""For us as a team we wanted to bounce back from Game 1. We weren't happy with that,"" said Pettersson.

""We played a good game. We should be happy about it but (we need) a short-term memory and be ready for Game 3.""

Goaltender Jacob Markstrom made 38 saves for the win while Robin Lehner stopped 22 shots for Vegas. It's the first time Vegas has allowed more than five goals in a game in the return-to-play tournament.

It was the first game back for Toffoli since the opening game of the qualifying round against the Minnesota Wild on Aug. 2. The NHL is not releasing information on injuries, but Toffoli had been seen in a walking boot.

Toffoli jumped over the boards for his first shift in the first period and scored nine seconds later, taking a cross-crease pass from Pettersson to put the puck into a yawning net. He then made it 2-0 on the power play, delivering a tape-to-tape pass to an incoming Horvat, who blasted it past Lehner.

""It's fun to get back in the lineup and get a big win and tie this series up,"" said Toffoli, who had been acquired at the trade deadline from the Los Angeles Kings. He had put up 10 points in his first 10 games with the Canucks before the regular season ended March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I made some phone calls yesterday, talked to a lot of people. It was a busy day,"" said Toffoli. ""It was good obviously getting the OK from everybody (to play). I got all excited. Felt like I was coming back to my first playoff series.""

Vancouver coach Travis Green said the 5-0 loss was their worst game of the playoffs and that Game 2 was a must-win.

""You go down two (games) against that team early in the series it would be tough and just mentally, too (to come back),"" he said.

""We were better with the puck, played a more direct game. I thought we were better on our feet, quicker. That's a good hockey team. I thought we did a good job of making them defend more than we did the first game.""

Despite being down by two goals in the second period, the Golden Knights looked like they were going to run the Canucks out of the rink again.

Markstrom kept the Canucks alive as Vegas tilted the ice and turned his net into a shooting gallery, blasting away for 22 shots in the period. Vegas got one goal back from Alex Tuch before Pettersson scored on a cross-ice feed from Alex Edler to make it 3-1 heading into the third.

""That really was a back-breaker,"" said Vegas head coach Peter DeBoer. ""You're down 3-1 and you have nothing to show for the work you put in to try and get back in the game.""

Tuch added: ""We knew Vancouver wasn't happy with the way they played last game and we knew they were going to come out flying. And we decided instead of being prepared, (to) be surprised by that for some reason.""

Vancouver iced the game 18 seconds into the third on Horvat's second goal. Then the frustration finally got to Vegas.

First, Max Pacioretty grabbed J.T. Miller by the head and threw him down after the whistle for a roughing penalty. Tuch got a double minor for pummelling Jake Virtanen while the Vancouver forward lay on the ice.

Pacioretty scored late for Vegas and Tanner Pearson added the final Vancouver goal into an empty net.

Horvat had not found the scoresheet since scoring two goals in each of the first two games against the St. Louis Blues in the first round.

Pettersson has been a steady point-getter throughout the playoffs but had been shut down by Vegas in Game 1, limited to no shots on net and one blocked shot.

Markstrom, in his first playoff series, has been the locomotive pulling the Canucks' playoff train. He allowed just nine goals on 121 shots (.926 save percentage) against Minnesota in the first round while registering his first playoff shutout. He saved 29 of 34 against the Blues (.930).

The series is being played at a fan-less Rogers Place. Players are isolating between contests to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This was Williams’ fifth match since professional tennis resumed amid the coronavirus pandemic after a hiatus of nearly six months — and all five have gone three sets. She is 3-2 in that stretch.

The result against No. 13 seed Sakkari, and particularly the way the match ended, was hardly promising for Williams as the U.S. Open’s start approaches next week.

The Western & Southern Open is usually held in Ohio but was moved to the U.S. Open’s site in Flushing Meadows this year to make for a two-event, no-spectator ""bubble"" during the pandemic.

In men's play, Canada's Milos Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Andy Murray. Raonic, from Thornhill, Ont., is the last Canadian remaining in the draw.

Williams was seemingly in control early, serving for the first set at 5-3, 30-0, when things began to unravel. She missed two backhands in a row, then put a forehand into the net to set up a break point, and walked over to the stand holding her towel at the back of the court (the ball people normally handle towels for players, but not during COVID-19).

That’s when chair umpire Aurelie Tourte called a time violation. On the following point, Williams sailed a forehand long to get broken.

At the ensuing changeover, the 23-time Grand Slam champion argued with Tourte, saying: ""I mean, I’m getting my own towels. That’s not fair. You should tell me on the sidelines next time if I need to play faster. Believe me, I will. ... You didn't even give me a warning.""

While Williams eventually did grab that set, she again frittered away a 5-3 lead in the second, plus a 4-1 edge in the tiebreaker. When she sat after the second set, the 38-year-old American tossed her racket over her shoulder the way an office worker might flip a crumpled piece of paper toward a trash can.

Williams came out flat in the third set, as if she’d rather be anywhere else. She double-faulted four times in the second game, including on Sakkari’s eighth break chance, to make it 2-0 and that was pretty much that.

Hours earlier, Novak Djokovic’s neck felt much better, and his tennis looked much better, in a 6-2, 6-4 victory over unseeded American Tennys Sandgren that improved the No. 1-ranked man to 20-0 in 2020.

""Actually, I’m pleasantly surprised with the way I recovered and felt today — just overall, physically, but also with the neck, specifically, because that was a little bit of a concern,"" said Djokovic, who will be eyeing his 18th Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open. ""Going back four, five days, I did struggle quite a lot.""

Djokovic was treated by a trainer and played sluggishly in his opening match Monday, but he was at his best from the outset against Sandgren and saved all four break points he faced.

Djokovic will face 34th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff in the quarterfinals. The other quarterfinal in the top half of the draw will be defending champion Daniil Medvedev against No. 8 seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Reilly Opelka, a 6-foot-11 American who is ranked 39th, delivered 19 aces and knocked off 2019 U.S. Open semifinalist Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 7-6 (4). Opelka next meets No. 4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, whose 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4) win over No. 16 John Isner was interrupted by a rain delay of nearly 1 1/2 hours late in the first set.

Also interrupted by the weather was Raonic's victory over the three-time Grand Slam champion. Raonic, a Wimbledon runner-up in 2016, has held all 29 games he’s served so far in the tournament.

""I have done the work,"" Raonic said. ""I have put in the effort, and I'm just happy that this quickly the pieces are coming together.""

This was Murray's first tournament appearance since November. He missed time due to a pelvic injury and is playing on a metal hip after two operations on that joint.

""Didn’t play well. It was not a good day,"" Murray said. ""The positives are that I got three matches in. Physically, I pulled up OK.""

Women’s quarterfinal matchups set earlier in the day were two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka against Anett Kontaveit, former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka against Ons Jabeur, and 83rd-ranked American qualifier Jessica Pegula against No. 14 Elise Mertens.

He was 5 under after the front nine Tuesday at Ozarks National when he hit driver at the par-4 10th. The ball wound up in such heavy rough that Mickelson couldn't find it, forcing him to take a penalty stroke. He still wound up making a long putt to salvage bogey, and that gave him some momentum for the rest of the round.

""I was able to get right back to even par on the back side with a birdie on the next hole, and then I made a couple more coming in,"" said Mickelson, whose 7-under 64 left him 17 under.

That was good for a four-shot lead over Tim Petrovic and Rod Pampling, who will be his playing partners for the final round. Mike Weir of Bright's Grove, Ont., (69) was nine shots off the lead at 8 under.

""I've been putting really well,"" Mickelson said. ""Today I didn't drive it the way I've been driving it. I kind of a hung a few drives, so I'm going to the range and try to work on that now. But when I come out tomorrow I'll try to be a little bit more aggressive with the driver and see if I can make a few more birdies.""

A few more? He's already made 19 of them in his first 36 holes.

Playing in the final group and with the shadows getting long, Mickelson picked up right where he left off after his opening-round 61. He made birdie at the third and then rattled off three straight beginning at the par-4 fifth, where he nearly chipped in for eagle.

Petrovic tried to make a run at Mickelson, but even one of his career-low rounds only got him so close. His putter went cold down the stretch and a poor approach at the par-4 finishing hole resulted in bogey.

Mickelson added a bridie at the ninth, the only hole he bogeyed on Monday, after a pretty flop shot over the bunker. After the lost ball at the 10th, Mickelson responded by adding two more birdies.

The second of them at the par-3 12th was a backhanded tap-in. His approach shot barely carried onto the front edge of the green, then nestled up to about an inch from the hole.

Mickelson could still squander the lead in the final round Wednesday, when tee times were moved to the early morning because of expected bad weather in the afternoon. But given the quality of his short game through 36 holes, the more pressing question is whether he could break the PGA Tour Champions' 54-hole scoring record of 191 — shared by Bruce Fleisher, Loren Roberts, Bernhard Langer, David Frost and Rocco Mediate.

Mickelson, who decided to make his debut on the over-50 tour to continue his U.S. Open prep after he was eliminated from the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, would need to shoot 65 in his final round Wednesday to move atop the list.

Petrovic and Pampling each shot 64-65 over the first two rounds. Rocco Mediate struggled coming in and was at 12 under.

K.J. Choi was another shot back, and Steve Stricker and David McKenzie were at 10 under.

Moments later, the Chicago White Sox right-hander threw the final pitch in a truly bizarre performance.

article continues below

A no-fan no-no.

With the seats at Guaranteed Rate Field empty, Giolito pitched the first no-hitter of the pandemic-delayed season, striking out 13 in leading the White Sox over the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 Tuesday night.

""2020 has been a very strange year,"" said Giolito, who conducted a postgame interview while wearing a mask. ""Obviously a lot of weird stuff going on with COVID and the state of the world, so may as well throw this in the mix.""

Sounds like he didn't mind that nobody saw it. Well, almost no one.

After right fielder Adam Engel extended on the run to catch Erik Gonzalez’s slicing drive toward the line for the final out, the hollers of Giolito’s teammates in the middle of the diamond echoed around the stadium.

""I’m just stoked for Lucas and so happy and ecstatic and emotional for Lucas,"" Engel said. ""It stinks we couldn’t celebrate the way most no-hitters get celebrated.""

The smallest crowd listed for any no-hitter in the majors over the last 100 years came in 1944, when a mere 1,014 watched Cincinnati’s Clyde Shoun beat the Braves at Crosley Field.

Nowhere close to that number on this night, not with the park that holds over 40,000 closed to fans because of virus protocols.

Suffice to say, years from now when White Sox fans fondly remember Giolito’s gem, there will not be, say, 100,000 or so people claiming they were there to see it in person.

At one point early in the game, some members of grounds crew drifted in sight, but that was about it outside of the teams.

An All-Star last year, the 26-year-old Giolito (3-2) matched his career high for strikeouts set in his previous start against Detroit.

Only a four-pitch walk to Gonzalez leading off the fourth inning got in Giolito’s way of perfection. That was only runner he permitted while throwing 101 pitches

""I’ve been working for this type of game for a while now and it’s really cool that we got it done,"" Giolito said.

Giolito relied on his changeup and fastball to make quick work of the Pirates, who came into the game batting just .229 and have the worst record in the majors. Six of their starters finished the game hitting under .199 this season.

The White Sox rushed toward the mound after the final out in Giolito’s first career no-hitter. Giolito hugged catcher James McCann as the Chicago players joined the party.

The South Side of Chicago normally rattles with fireworks after a home win -- this is the club that gave the game the exploding scoreboard -- but the park remained silent as the dugout emptied.

Giolito, meanwhile, was locked in his own zone in the later innings, fully aware of what was at stake.

""After the seventh, six more outs, looking at who I was facing, became very, very, very possible,"" he said, ""and then we were able to get it done.""

Giolito said his approach never wavered.

""Just staying with the same, like, mental routine for every single pitch. One pitch at a time. Full focus, full execution, straight through the target,"" he said.

Giolito pitched the 19th no-hitter in White Sox history — second most to the Dodgers' 23 — and first since Philip Humber threw a perfect game at Seattle in 2012. This was the seventh time the Pirates have been held hitless, with Washington’s Max Scherzer having done it in 2015.

White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson made a nifty play on a grounder by Bryan Reynolds up the middle in the seventh to preserve the gem, helped by first baseman Jose Abreu’s stretch at the bag.

In the ninth, Gonzalez hit a liner that Engel, a fleet centre fielder for most of his career, caught on the run at knee-high height.

""Yeah man, I think I got it,"" Gonzalez said. ""With that at-bat, I was a little bit mad because I don’t want to be part of history.""

Giolito improved to 30-28 in his big league career. He made his debut with Washington in 2016, then was traded after that season to the White Sox in a package for outfielder Adam Eaton.

Giolito gave up a major league-high 118 earned runs in 2018, his first full season in Chicago.

""I was pretty much bottom of the league in almost every stat,"" Giolito said. ""I kind of had to ... learn from failure to learn my true potential.""

He added: ""I always envisioned that I’d throw a no-hitter in the big leagues.""

Giolito threw the first no-hitter at Guaranteed Rate Field since Minnesota’s Francisco Liriano did it in 2011.

The White Sox, who’ve won eight of their last nine, ended the Pirates’ season-best winning streak at three games.

Giolito was dominant in his previous start, too, fanning 13 against Detroit and allowing just three hits in seven innings. The victory over Pittsburgh was his third career shutout.

Chicago’s first three batters reached in the second and all three came home one at a time after Engel’s groundout and singles Anderson and Eloy Jimenez. McCann added a sacrifice fly in the third off Steven Brault (0-1).

TRAINER’S ROOM

Pirates: RH reliever Keone Kela was available to pitch after leaving Friday’s loss to Milwaukee with forearm tightness. … Infielders Colin Moran (collision) and Kevin Newman (abdomen) also were on the bench after leaving Sunday’s game.

White Sox: McCann stayed in the game after being struck near his left hand by a second-inning pitch from Brault. ... Jimenez appeared to be getting treatment near the mound after the celebration, but manager Rick Renteria said he walked off under his own power.

UP NEXT

LHP Dallas Keuchel (4-2, 2.65) looks for his third straight win Wednesday afternoon against Pirates RHP Trevor Williams (1-4, 3.70).

His team gave up a goal he felt shouldn't have counted three minutes into the opening period and had a subsequent equalizer called back on a razor-thin offside challenge.

Down 1-0 in the series and playing well, Tampa Bay then grabbed its first lead in more than 110 minutes of action midway through the third period only to see Boston tie it up with under four minutes to go in regulation.

""Adversity strikes in the weirdest ways,"" Cooper said. ""You never know when it's going to happen.

""Sometimes you're just dealt ... a sandwich that doesn't taste very good, if you know what I mean.""

And deal with it they did.

Ondrej Palat scored at 4:40 of overtime as the Lightning defeated the Bruins 4-3 to even their second-round playoff series 1-1.

Blake Coleman added two goals in regulation for the Lightning, while Nikita Kucherov had the other. Andrei Vasilevskiy made 22 saves to get the win.

""If there was one message that was going on it was we liked everything that was going on about the game,"" Cooper said. ""I know it sounds so cliche, but we just had to stick with it. Some teams, if you have mental weakness at all, you're probably sitting there saying, 'Poor us.'

""But it's just not been this group. That's not how they operate.""

Brad Marchand buried his second of the night to tie things with under four minutes left in the third period for the Bruins, while Nick Ritchie also scored. David Pastrnak added two assists for Boston, which got 36 stops from Jaroslav Halak.

The teams don't have much time to digest the result, with Game 3 of the best-of-seven matchup set for Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET back inside the fan-less Scotiabank Arena.

Tampa, which beat the Columbus Blue Jackets in quintuple overtime of Game 1 in the opening round before closing out the series in the extra period of Game 5 on a pair of goals from Brayden Point, got the winner after Boston couldn't clear its zone.

Patrick Maroon tried a wraparound that Halak stopped, but Palat was there to bury the rebound to score his first of the post-season and send the Lightning pouring off their bench in celebration.

""It's obviously big-time frustrating any time you lose a game and especially in that fashion,"" Bruins centre Sean Kuraly said. ""We thought we were trending in the right direction, (thinking) momentum may be swinging our way. You get the puck close to the blue line a couple times and you don't get it out, and against a good team that's what happens.

""It ends up in the back of your net.""

Acquired prior to February's trade deadline from the New Jersey Devils, Coleman gave Tampa its first lead of the series at 10:40 of the third after taking a stretch pass from Victor Hedman. The Lightning centre moved in alone on Halak and snuck an off-speed shot through the five-hole after getting slashed by Bruins defenceman Connor Clifton.

Boston, however, responded with 3:58 left in regulation when Marchand finished off a pretty passing play. With the Bruins in the middle of a change — Patrice Bergeron would normally be on the ice — Kuraly took a feed from Pastrnak and quickly found Marchand to bury his sixth and knot things up.

The Bruins, who triumphed 3-2 in Game 1 on the back of Halak's 35-save performance, took a 2-1 lead with 5:27 left in the second on a power play when Pastrnak faked a one-timer before sliding a pass to Marchand at the side of the net.

Tampa responded 56 seconds later after some great work from Point. The diminutive centre twisted and turned in the Bruins zone before finding Kevin Shattenkirk, whose shot was tipped in by Kucherov for his third.

The Lightning dressed seven defencemen with Ryan McDonagh (undisclosed), who has averaged a team-high 26:07 of ice time in the post-season, out injured after leaving midway through the third period of Game 1. Veteran blue-liners Luke Schenn and Braydon Coburn drew in, while Carter Verhaeghe was scratched up front.

Boston owned the best record in the NHL when the league suspended its season because of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, but dropped to the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference after losing all three of its games in the round-robin portion of the restart.

The Bruins found their groove in the first round of the usual 16-team playoff bracket, disposing of the Carolina Hurricanes in five games.

Tampa, meanwhile, had the second-best mark in the East and was fourth overall when the schedule was halted. The Lightning finished second in the round-robin and then downed Columbus.

The Bruins jumped out to a 1-0 lead at 3:14 of Tuesday's first period after Tampa defenceman Zach Bogosian's stick disintegrated at the offensive blue line. Boston broke the other way, with Ritchie stuffing his first past Vasilevskiy, who thought he had the puck covered — much to Cooper's chagrin.

The Lightning responded a couple minutes later when Barclay Goodrow tipped Coburn's point shot up and over Halak. The Bruins, however, correctly challenged for offside after Point was a fraction of a second too slow exiting the Boston zone on the tag up.

Cooper fired a number of expletives at the officials when the call was reversed, but was back smiling on the bench after a surprising burst from an unlikely source eventually knotted the score.

Bogosian, a bruising blue-liner known mostly for his physical play, split two Boston defenders, and as he was getting knocked down fed a diving Coleman, who slid his second past Halak before crashing into the net at 12:42.

""I saw Bogo picking up some speed,"" Coleman said. ""He just kind of had that look in his eye like he was about to do something. I just made it a point to get up into play with him, try to give him an option.

""He made a heck of a play.""

It was also the first sign the Lightning weren't going to be fazed by that early adversity.

""Any time there's a mishap, you just turn the page,"" Cooper said of his roster. ""It was needed tonight, I'll tell you that, because they need to be rewarded for the work they were doing.

""And in the end, they were.""

The All-Star guard scored 35 points and the Los Angeles Clippers rolled past the Dallas Mavericks 154-111 on Tuesday night to take a 3-2 lead in their first-round Western Conference playoff series.

George had shot 29% in the series and endured fans' wrath on social media. He said he spoke to the team psychiatrist before Game 5.

""I mean, whatever it was, the bubble got the best of me,"" George said. ""I was just in a dark place. I really wasn’t here. I checked out. The past couple of games, it was just difficult.""

George said it didn't feel like the playoffs until his teammates decided to create the atmosphere that was lacking inside the NBA's Walt Disney World bubble.

""I came in with that mindset that this is Staples, we’re at home,"" he said. ""The place is packed. I really had to psych myself up. I thought the whole team took that and we ran with it. We created our own energy. We decided to dictate this game.""

Kawhi Leonard scored 32 points and Montrezl Harrell added 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers, who set a franchise record for points in a playoff game. Los Angeles can clinch the series on Thursday.

Dallas' Luka Doncic, who hit a game-winner at the buzzer in Game 4 to cap off a 43-point triple-double, was held to 22 points on 6-for-17 shooting.

Dallas coach Rick Carlisle was ejected in the third quarter of the testy game, which included six technicals and a flagrant-1 foul.

Doncic said Clippers forward Marcus Morris might have stepped on his ankle intentionally early in the third quarter.

""I don’t want to talk to him,"" Doncic said. ""He’s just saying a lot of bad stuff to me all the game. I don’t want to talk to him. I’ve just got to move on. Like I said, everybody’s going to have their own opinion. I just hope it wasn’t intentional. If that was intentional, that’s very bad.""

Mavericks centre Kristaps Porzingis sat out with right knee soreness. It was the second straight game the 7-foot-3 Latvian missed.

Leonard scored 22 points and Paul George scored 18 to help Los Angeles take a 76-52 lead at halftime. The Clippers shot 61% in the first half and led by as many as 27 points.

The Clippers continued the onslaught in the second half, bumping the lead to as many as 45 points.

""Tough game,"" Carlisle said. ""Very poor performance by us. It was disappointing. It was very physical. We just need to have a stronger physical disposition to start the game and throughout. We’ve got to get some more traction at both ends of the floor.""

TIP-INS

Mavericks: Doncic was issued a technical foul in the second quarter. ... G Tim Hardaway Jr. was called for a flagrant-1 after winding up and hitting George in the face on a drive. ... Assistant Stephen Silas took over as coach after Carlisle was ejected.

Clippers: Shot 67% from the field in the first quarter. ... Hardaway and Morris were called for double technicals in the second quarter. C Ivica Zubac was called for a technical in the third.

BIGGER THAN BASKETBALL

Clippers coach Doc Rivers was emotional while discussing the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which has sparked national outrage and some violent protests. Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back while his three children watched.

""That video, if you watch that video — you don’t need to be Black to be outraged,"" Rivers said. ""You need to be American and outraged. How dare the Republicans talk about fear. We’re the ones that need to be scared. We’re the ones having to talk to every Black child. What white father has to give his son a talk about being careful if you get pulled over? It’s just ridiculous. It keeps going. There’s no charges. Breonna Taylor — no charges. Nothing. All we’re asking is you live up to the Constitution. That’s all we’re asking -- for everybody. For everyone.""

CARLISLE'S EJECTION

Carlisle described what led to his ejection. Hardaway had the ball at the free-throw line, and then Rivers was granted a timeout.

""My understanding in that situation is that once a shooter has the ball, a timeout cannot be called by the opposing coach,"" Carlisle said. ""I thought the call was wrong. So I was asking about it and wasn’t getting a great explanation and then it turned into a technical and then another technical. I’m just standing up for my team.""

Transport Canada data obtained by The Canadian Press this week shows 75 per cent of the $300-million program has already been spoken for, just 15 months into its three-year mandate.

article continues below

The rebate, which provides up to $5,000 back on the purchase or lease of a new battery vehicle, or a battery-gasoline hybrid one, began May 1, 2019, and was supposed to run until April 30, 2022.

But as of July 31, more than $225 million had been paid out to 53,510 drivers.

""It's no surprise to me,"" said Daniel Breton, president of Electric Mobility Canada, a non-profit agency pushing for the electrification of transportation.

Electric car sales, as a share of overall vehicle purchases, have steadily grown from two per cent of all sales in 2018 to three per cent last year, and to almost four per cent in the first three months of 2020.

But the rate of uptake is heavily concentrated in just three provinces. Quebec and British Columbia, which have sales quotas for electric cars and provincial rebates on top of the federal one, together account for 86 per cent of all the rebates.

Ontario, which had a provincial rebate until 2019, accounted for another 12 per cent, with the remaining two per cent divided among the other seven provinces and the territories.

Breton said the additional provincial rebate makes buying electric cars more attractive in Quebec and B.C. but car makers are also shipping more electric cars there because their dealers have quotas for sales. Availability of electric models is limited, and many drivers have to wait weeks or months for one.

Electric Mobility Canada wants Ottawa to expand the program to include used cars and to increase the maximum purchase price of the cars that qualify for a rebate. SUVs and pickup trucks, which are more expensive, are set to come onto the market. In 2019, almost three in every four passenger vehicles sold were SUVs and pickups.

Cara Clairman, CEO of the non-profit advocacy group Plug'n Drive, says she hopes Ottawa will provide more money for rebates when the current allotment runs out because they are making a difference.

""I think we do need a few more years of it,"" she said. ""You have to look at it as a climate-change program.""

Canada has set targets to have 10 per cent of all passenger vehicles sold be electric by 2025, 30 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2040. Breton said that won't happen if the rebate isn't expanded.

Breton is also looking for the rebates to be extended to used electric and hybrid vehicles, which are now more easy to find than new ones in many cases. A 10-per-cent rebate on the purchase of a used electric car was mentioned in the mandate letter for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains last fall but has not yet been announced.

Transport Minister Marc Garneau was instructed in his mandate letter to do more to make the electric car sales quotas. Before the pandemic, he indicated he was looking at what more to do, including extending or expanding the rebate program. Something was expected in the March federal budget, delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Garneau's spokeswoman was noncommittal Thursday when asked if the rebate program would be expanded.

""This specific program continues and consumers are able to make use of the incentive,"" Livia Belcea said in an email. ""Any changes in funding for the program would be reviewed at the appropriate time and as needed.""

Wale Road and the Island Highway is a non-right-angle intersection.
Steve Wallace is the owner of Wallace Driving School on Vancouver Island.","It is difficult to explain the reason for some intersections on Vancouver Island making the top 10 most dangerous crash list for 2019.

The 101 crashes at the almost completed McKenzie and Highway 1 project is somewhat predictable, but still a little odd. One would think the increased scrutiny throughout the construction phase would be cause for pause. The sheer volume of traffic of all types must have something to do with it.

article continues below

The McKenzie-Highway 17 (Pat Bay Highway) merge area is No. 2 on the list, with 68 crashes. There are some not so obvious differences in this seemingly simple configuration. It is really a double merge and therefore not just a single lateral move that drivers must negotiate when heading west and entering from McKenzie.

The third highest number of crashes are at the Boleskine and Douglas intersection. This location has been a perennial top 10 contender. It is really the Highway 1 corridor with 62 crashes, but is rather seen to be a city street, as opposed to a provincial responsibility. Left-turn cheaters and a far-lane timing move might be the cause of so many incidents at a very standard type of intersection.

Sixty-one crashes were recorded at the five-headed monster, better known as the Hillside-Douglas-Gorge intersection. This is also a perennial placer in the not-where-you-want-to-be category. Let us all hope this returns to a giant traffic circle, asap, as in days long since gone by.

At least everyone would be going the same direction, eliminating the requirement for a left turn and the potential dreaded head-on collision.

Millstream and the Trans-Canada highway takes a tie for fourth (61) as a relative newcomer to the yearly tally. Westshore makes the big time, in a not-so-envious way. This is partly because of the amazing development as of late. It is possibly the fastest-growing place in Canada. The outsiders looking for a big-box fix can probably be blamed for the entry into the top 10 bumper-car type of collisions.

The sixth most common crash site is a mystery to me. After moving the bus stop at the Pat Bay Highway and Sayward Road, it was believed all was well in hand. The crash rate was significantly reduced, and we all thought this location would never again darken these pages. Well, it only took a few years and here we go again. The crash incidences at this location not only defy logic, but also make a mockery of the large capital expense thought to have solved the problem. Blame it on ferry traffic! Maybe visitors! Who knows?

No. 7 is a golf shot from No. 3. Blanshard and Saanich is an odd member of the top 10. It is a one-way location of Highway 17. One-way street locations are generally safer places. This one stumps me, unless it is once again the fault of the left-turn cheaters turning from Saanich.

Nos. 8 and 9 are in Nanaimo, namely the Island Highway at Bowen and at Mostar. Of all the disappointing locations to make the list, these two are the most difficult to understand.

They are on the same bypass road. Left-turn lunacy? Non-synchronized traffic lights? This is a total mystery to me. I am stumped. How about you? Wide open and lots of room! I never have any problems at these intersections.

No. 10 is a newcomer. Wale Road and the Island Highway is a non-right-angle intersection. What is it doing on the list? It just does not belong. Any thoughts?

Last week’s column about Richardson assumed the first iteration of a shared lane was the preferred option. This was incorrect. A non-through street barrier option was chosen instead, matched with two opposite flow lanes. Thanks to readers for pointing it out.

Alonso crashed in Turn 4 when his Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet dipped onto the concrete portion of the apron at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and sent the Spaniard into the retaining wall. His damaged car rolled onto pit lane for an early end to his afternoon.

Alonso was sixth on the speed chart when he crashed. He ended up ninth for the day.

""It is just the way it is,"" Alonso said. ""Fortunately it happened today and not on (race day). We will learn from this. Nothing we can do now and tomorrow we start again.""

Alonso is making his third attempt to win the final leg of motorsports' version of the Triple Crown. The two-time Formula One champion has victories in the Monaco Grand Prix and 24 Hours of Le Mans, with Indianapolis the only race missing from the trifecta.

He had a strong car in 2017 when he raced at Indianapolis for Andretti Autorsport but an engine failure ended his shot at victory. Alonso failed to qualify for the Indy 500 last year in an effort from McLaren.

He also crashed during Indy 500 practice last year and it contributed to the many setbacks the McLaren team had during its preparations. The McLaren backup car was not the proper shade of orange and Alonso lost valuable practice time as the colour was corrected.

Alonso's crash with just over 50 minutes remaining in Thursday's session was the first wreck since the track opened Wednesday for practice.

Meanwhile, five-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon topped the speed charts at the end of the day with a lap at 226.102 mph for Chip Ganassi Racing. He was followed by Takuma Sato at 225.693 and Marco Andretti at 225.249 mph as Honda's took the top three spots.

Conor Daly at 225.106 was fourth and the fastest Chevrolet.

James Hinchcliffe of Oakville, Ont., was 17th and Dalton Kellett of Stouffville, Ont., was 28th.

There is one more day of practice before qualifying, called ""Fast Friday"" as IndyCar gives teams a horsepower boost to increase speeds. Defending race winner Simon Pagenaud said Team Penske had a deliberate plan to work on handling Thursday and will worry about speed during Fast Friday practice.

""I have no interest in drafting and getting a big number out there,"" Pagenaud said. ""There's no interest for me to do that. I know I can win this race and I know what I need. That's more important than drafting and putting up a big number."""

It created an opening at Carpenter on Conor Daly's car. One of Carpenter's crew members had worked with Pearn before and the connection was made: Pearn, the crew chief of Martin Truex Jr.'s 2017 NASCAR championship season, would work the Indianapolis 500.

""They asked. It was like, ‘Yeah, why not?’"" said Pearn, who called the Indy 500 a bucket list event. ""It's hard when you race your whole life and just completely turn it all off. So it's kind of nice to scratch that itch at the same time.""

Daly, in his first day working with Pearn, was ninth fastest around Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The Chevrolet was even faster Thursday, when Daly briefly sat atop the speed chart before Takuma Sato bumped him down a spot. He ended the day fourth overall in speed.

""We made some really good changes overnight and Cole has an idea of what he wants to do. He's got an interesting way of working, he's like ‘Yep, I know exactly what I want to do,’"" Daly said. ""I really like communicating with him and I think we are vibing really well.""

Daly, making his seventh Indy 500 start, finished a career-best 10th in his hometown race last season while running for Andretti Autosport. A scrapper who has pieced together a full IndyCar season swapping between Carpenter for oval races and Carlin Racing for street and road course events, the 28-year-old Daly is trying to stabilize his career.

Daly will try to parlay a strong 500 into full-time work while relying on a part-time engineer in the 37-year-old Pearn.

""I’ve learned to just try to get along with everyone,"" Daly said. ""I’m a very trusting individual. Obviously, Cole has an incredible amount of experience in the racing world. Was a driver himself, as well. He knows what’s going on.""

Pearn's most noted success is in stock cars and a five-year stint as Truex's crew chief that produced 24 Cup Series victories. The team raced for the title three consecutive years, finishing second in back-to-back seasons after the 2017 championship.

Things began to change when Furniture Row Racing closed at the end of the 2018 season and Pearn and Truex were pulled into Joe Gibbs Racing. They won seven races and were runner-up to teammate Kyle Busch in the title race when Pearn decided he'd had enough.

He has since watched NASCAR on television and provides both insightful and comedic commentary on social media. Pearn recognized he missed racing.

""For sure missed the competition side,"" Pearn said. ""This is obviously a fully different experience, but racing is still racing. You throw a green and checkered.""

To prepare for Indy, Pearn took a very literal approach — ""I had to read the rule book,"" he said.

He's always followed IndyCar and his racing experience qualifies Pearn for the crossover that few expect will be a difficult transition.

""I grew up knowing these cars, it's not like it's anything crazy,"" Pearn said. ""In some regards it is kind of simple and it's just about understanding the procedures and how we set the cars up, learn how tech goes. The physics is honestly the easiest part, understanding how everything else works is the harder part.""

When Carpenter made the hire, he had no doubt bringing in Pearn would be seamless and give Daly a shot at winning the Indianapolis 500.

""I believe when you bring in smart and talented people that have a work ethic, they’re going to figure it out,"" Carpenter said. ""There’s a lot that’s different but a lot of the processes are the same. Some of the language is different. He’s definitely putting in the work to do it, getting prepared. A lot of what we’re doing at Indy is making decisions in the moment. I think we all feel like Cole has those traits."""

Unifor, which represents about 20,000 Canadian workers between the three companies, said the recent COVID-19 pandemic has stoked uncertainty about future job security as economies struggle.

article continues below

""This round of talks is especially unique and challenging,"" said the union, on its website outlining the auto talks. ""This year's contract talks will pivot on good jobs and future investment.""

Ford also said that ""global economic uncertainties"" have stressed the importance of maintaining jobs in Canada.

""We'll be asking our employees to work with us to help shape this new reality together,"" said spokeswoman Rose Pao in a statement.

The negotiations will focus on collective agreements that expire Sept. 21. The union said that it will identify on Sept. 8 its ""strike target"" — the manufacturer it will target first to set a pattern for the other agreements.

Unifor national president Jerry Dias says he will be on the lookout for any attempts by the manufacturers to use COVID-19 as an ""excuse."" He says other than improving wage increases, he expects major battlegrounds will be a new product investment from Ford in Oakville, putting a stop to outsourcing Ford parts depots, and restoring the third shift in Fiat Chrysler's Windsor and Brampton facilities. Dias is also eyeing the 2023 expiration of major programs in GM's powertrain operation in St. Catharines.

While recent trade policy changes, when enacted, will improve the state of play, Dias says the government needs to do more to attract electric vehicle investments to Canada.

""This is an industry that pays a lot of taxes,"" says Dias. ""And it's a lot of jobs. So everybody's going to have to start to row together in the right direction.""

Ian Lee, associate professor of management at Sprott School of Business at Carleton University, says the economic pressure on the auto industry has created an uphill battle for unions.

""GM, Ford, FCA, I think they're increasingly in the driver's seat,"" says Lee.

""Unifor, in these upcoming negotiations, they're in the fight of their life. I think that there is not going to be so much on wages. I think it's going to be, 'Can we save the plants that are left?'""

The new round of negotiations come as the industry is still dealing with fallout from the novel coronavirus. For example, FCA plants in Canada were down from March 18 to May 4, and GM plants were closed between March 16 and May 25, after which they gradually reopened.

Like previous recessions, auto sales also sputtered during the early months of the COVID-19 outbreak. DesRosiers Automotive Consultants Inc. said that auto sales plunged 48 per cent year-over-year in March, but by July, sales had fallen just 4.9 per cent, the smallest decrease since the pandemic began.

Nonetheless, DesRosiers predicted that annual sales rates will remain flat for one to two years.

The new negotiations will be set against the background of the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which went into force July 1.

The deal included a provision that a significant percentage of the value of a car be produced by workers earning the equivalent of at least US$16 per hour, something the Canadian government said could improve Canadian automotive manufacturing's competitiveness compared to that of Mexico.

While some trade policy changes, when enacted, will improve the state of play, Dias says the government needs to do more to attract electric vehicle investments to Canada.

""This is an industry that pays a lot of taxes,"" says Dias. ""And it's a lot of jobs. So everybody's going to have to start to row together in the right direction.""

Between 1999 and 2017, Canada dropped to the No. 10 auto manufacturing country in the world, down from No. 4 in 1999, Unifor previously estimated.

""Mexico is building smaller cars, in a threat to Canada. But I've argued that the biggest threat to Canada is not Mexico. It's the southern United States,"" says Lee.

""In the American South, it's not only wages that are lower ... taxes are lower, state taxes are lower, land costs are lower, cost of living is lower.""

In 2016, GM was targeted by the union, which cited the company's financial surplus and asked for new allocations for vehicles and powertrain and better incentives for new hires and retirees.

The agreements, which can be hundreds of pages in length, ended up converting 700 jobs at GM and securing a $713-million investment and 500 jobs from Ford, among other issues.

Last year marked the culmination of downsizing at a GM plant in Oshawa, Ont. The plant east of Toronto now has about 300 workers, down from about 2,600.

""There's going to be a great temptation for the three companies: When they close down these particular cars as a segment, they will not replace them. If you don't replace them, you close up a plant,"" says Lee.

It won't be in May, it won't be in front of hundreds of thousands of fans, and many of the other rituals associated with the race will be altered due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

But Kellett still got to take in one of the traditions.

""One cool thing that they did do is every year they rename the streets downtown with the drivers' last names,"" said Kellet. ""So there's a street called Kellett Avenue in downtown Indianapolis right now. I went down and took a picture of that the other day.""

The 26-year-old noted that most of the race's traditions revolve around spectators and fan interaction, which he said he considers a real loss for this year's Indy 500. However, he's still looking forward to the pre-race process should he qualify for the race on Saturday.

""Lining up the cars on the front straightaway, 11 rows of three, the pageantry, the history behind the race, it's what makes you realize how big an event it is,"" said Kellett.

Kellett, from Stouffville, Ont., is in the midst of his rookie IndyCar season, albeit one that has been shortened and re-arranged by the COVID-19 pandemic. He's competed in three races so far this season, the GMR Grand Prix (21st) and Road America (20th in both races).

""I think given the lack of track time and testing I'm content with what we've done so far,"" said Kellett. ""Obviously, we want to be competing a little bit further up the course on the road course but I think that will just be a process of learning and getting up to speed with everything.

Practice laps continued on so-called ""Fast Friday"" as IndyCar gives teams a horsepower boost to increase speeds. Fellow Canadian James Hinchcliffe of Oakville, Ont., was seventh overall after Marco Andretti posted the fastest Friday lap since 1996 to finish the day first overall.

""Coming into today with the extra boost there were a lot of unknowns, but it was awesome to get out there and start knocking out 230’s from the first run,"" said Hinchcliffe, whose time was 38.7987 seconds. ""We ran through our program , and I think we made some good progress.""

Kellett was 28th with a time of 39.2844 seconds.

""Just finished up my first Fast Friday. I feel like I can finally breathe now. It was a long day of qualifying runs,"" said Kellett. ""I think we’ve got a good compromise between outright speed and also just having the car for the entire four laps.""

Qualifying will be on Saturday with the race itself on Aug. 23. Should he qualify to race, it will be a dream come true for Kellett, whose favourite Indy 500 moment was when Jacques Villeneuve of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que., won in 1995.

""It would be the biggest race of my career and the culmination of a lot of years of hard work coming through the junior ranks,"" Kellett said. ""It would be a big moment. I can't emphasize enough how exciting it would be to be in the field of 33 and represent Canada and represent A.J. Foyt racing.""

GM, in a motion last week, alleged that Fiat Chrysler used foreign bank accounts to bribe union officials so they would stick GM with higher labour costs.

But in a response, the Italian-American automaker fired back, calling GM’s claims ""defamatory and baseless.""

GM alleged in its motion that FCA spent millions on bribes by stashing the money in foreign accounts. The assertion that there is new evidence came as GM asked a federal judge to reconsider his July dismissal of a federal racketeering lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler.

In trying to revive the lawsuit, GM alleged that bribes were paid to two former United Auto Workers presidents, as well as a former union vice-president and at least one former GM employee.

In its response, Fiat Chrysler said the judge should deny GM's motion. GM, FCA said, has to know that the prospect of getting the judge to overturn the dismissal is slim to none. ""So this motion is apparently a vehicle to make more defamatory and baseless accusations about a competitor that is winning in the marketplace.""

FCA denied allegations by GM that FCA paid two ""moles"" to infiltrate GM and send inside information. The company also denied that foreign bank accounts were involved. ""That GM has extended its attacks to individual FCA officers and employees, making wild allegations against them without a shred of factual support, is despicable,"" FCA lawyers wrote.

GM's claims are based on the alleged existence of foreign bank accounts, which are legal, Fiat Chrysler wrote. ""There is not one well-pled allegation in the proposed amended complaint (by GM) that these foreign bank accounts were used to pay bribes or facilitate any other illegal conduct,"" FCA's response said.

GM contends that bribes were paid to former United Auto Workers Presidents Dennis Williams and Ron Gettelfinger, as well as Vice-President Joe Ashton. It also alleges money was paid to GM employees including Al Iacobelli, a former FCA labour negotiator who was hired and later released by GM.

GM alleges that payments were made so the officials would saddle GM with more than $1 billion in additional labour costs.

Gettelfinger, whose name had not come up previously in a wide-ranging federal probe of UAW corruption, vehemently denied the allegations in a statement and said he had no foreign accounts. Williams’ California home was raided by federal agents but he has not been charged. Iacobelli, who is awaiting sentencing in the probe, also denied the claims.

In July, U.S. District Judge Paul Borman in Detroit tossed out GM’s lawsuit that alleged that Fiat Chrysler paid off union leaders to get better contract terms than GM.

He wrote that GM’s alleged injuries were not caused by FCA violating federal racketeering laws, and that the people harmed by the bribery scheme were Fiat Chrysler workers.

GM’s motion contended that payments were made to accounts in places like Switzerland, Luxembourg, Italy, Singapore and the Cayman Islands. The accounts were set up to avoid detection in the federal criminal probe, according to the motion. The accounts were discovered recently by private investigators working on GM’s behalf, according to court records."

The attractive four-passenger two-door sportster set a first model year sales record of 680,989, admittedly a long one that ran from April ’64 to August ’65. It caught the competition so off guard it took rival Chevrolet until the 1967 model year to respond with its Camaro.

The Mustang made Ford’s general manager Lee Iacocca a household name and put his picture on the cover of both Time and Newsweek. It also spawned a class of vehicle known as the Pony Car.

article continues below

As inevitably seems to happen, the Mustang grew bigger and heavier. By 1973 it was about 305 millimetres longer, 152 mm wider and about 272 kilograms heavier than the original.

The Mustang had outgrown its original appeal as an affordable, nimble sporty car. As Iacocca summed up: “The Mustang market never left us, we left it.”

Sales confirmed this, sliding from more than 600,000 in model year 1966, to just 134,267 in 1973. What’s more, new, lighter, imported 2+2 mini-Pony Cars combining four-on-the-floor fun with upscale luxury were becoming increasingly popular. They were filling the segment Mustang had created and gradually abandoned.

Cars such as the Toyota Celica and Ford’s own German Capri (sold by Lincoln-Mercury dealers, and ironically inspired by the original Mustang), were the stimulus for a new, smaller Mustang to try recapturing the earlier magic.

Plans for the trimmer 1974 Mustang began in 1970, and just as the original was based on mundane Falcon components, the new one used the new-for-1971 subcompact Ford Pinto as its foundation. This complete departure was called the Mustang II.

Iacocca specified a wheelbase of 2,438 to 2,540 mm in notchback and fastback coupes. This precluded using a long engine, so a 2.3-litre, overhead cam inline four was the base power with a 2.8- litre, overhead valve V-6 optional, and standard in the upscale Mustang II Mach I. The four was the U.S.-built Pinto engine while the option was a stretch of the Capri’s 2.6 litre V-6 from Germany.

Ford’s engineers took downsizing seriously and made the Mustang II even smaller than the original. The wheelbase was reduced from 2,743 mm to 2,443 mm and ove-all length from 4,613 mm to 4,445 mm. It was a full 508 mm shorter and 102 mm narrower than the bloated ’73 model it replaced.

In spite of its smaller size, mandated safety and emission equipment brought the unit construction Mustang II’s weighy to 1,270 kg, a little heavier than the original’s 1,179 kg.

The attractive styling was influenced by coachbuilder Ghia of Italy, recently acquired by Ford, and carried on the long-hood, short-deck theme of the original. It came as a notchback and hatch-equipped fastback.

The Mustang II was no match for the original’s performance. Road & Track (8/64) reported the original 4.7 litre (289 cu in.) V-8 Mustang sprinted to 97 km/h (60 mph) in 9.0 seconds and had a top speed of 177 (110).

The Mustang II Mach I with the 2.8 litre V-6 (R&T 9/73) ran zero to 97 (60) in 13.8 seconds with top speed of 161 (100). The four was, of course, even slower.

When Ford advertised the new 1974 Mustang as “The right car at the right time,” they couldn’t have known how prescient they would be. In November 1973, conditions changed dramatically when the Arab oil embargo precipitated the first of two 1970s “energy crises.”

Not only did gasoline prices spike but its supply was rumoured to be in jeopardy. Fuel economy immediately became the hot item and helped boost the smaller Mustang’s first calendar year sales to 385,993.

With oil crisis memories fading by 1975, Ford offered a 5.0-litre V-8 in the Mustang II, bringing performance closer to the original’s. R&T (1/75) recorded zero to 97 km/h (60 mph) in 10.5 seconds and top speed of 171 (106).

A Cobra II with options such as extra trim, black grille, front air dam and rear spoiler came in 1976. There was also a Stallion package with different paint treatment and stallion decals on the front fenders. For 1978 there was the even more garish King Cobra with standard 5.0-litre V-8, deeper air dam, stripes and a cobra decal on the hood.

The Mustang II was built through the 1978 model year, then replaced by the 1979 Fairmont-based, third-generation Mustang. Many Mustang enthusiasts disdained the Mustang II as a wimpy aberration, not a “real” Mustang. It was, however, a product of its time and became a desirable collectible for many."

This phrase comes to mind when referencing not only Richardson, but also Vancouver street.

Vancouver Street will no longer be a through street for motor vehicles.","Years ago, pavement politics meant the government of the day would be looking to curry favour with the electorate immediately before an election, by paving everything in sight. These days, it might mean just the opposite.

Dysfunction-By-The-Sea is truly a place in Backward Columbia. Try Suicide Lanes by the Sea. Yes, the City of Victoria seems to want to solve problems that do not exist. Longtime residents of Victoria can remember the giant traffic circle at the Douglas-Hillside-Gorge intersection. According to those who are still alive, it worked very well. Traffic flowed in one direction, eliminating the dreaded head-on and T-bone crash potential. This functioning roundabout was replaced with a brand-new toy, signalized traffic lights. Proving once again you can always tell an engineer, but not very much. Giving up on a proven technology in favour of an unproven new toy is their eternal fault. Their heralded advancements are much appreciated, but every so often, they overreach. Frankly, we cannot live without engineers, but every so often, we could do without their shiny new toy.

The ultra-brand-new toy is the shared lane insanity about to be hoisted upon an unsuspecting commuting public.

The one-block trial, where a single lane, referred to as a Suicide lane in the old days, is intended to serve opposite motor vehicle directional travel. Once a driver comes face-to-face with another car driver in the single provided road lane, it is expected that each would swerve right. This action takes the drivers into the well-marked, same direction, painted bike lanes on each side of the street.

By the way, bike riders are not restricted to these well-marked bike lanes. Drivers will not only have to make a right shoulder check before moving right from the suicide lane, but also check their left shoulder before returning to the suicide lane, since bike riders are not restricted to bike lanes.

I have nothing against bikes. I like bike riders. The more bike riders, the fewer cars needed to get from A to B. This odd new toy will be especially difficult for visitors to our city. Who in their right mind, would choose a city block, with a major hotel complex, to do a first run of this unnecessary matrix? What do visitors to the hotel think? Is this block of Humboldt street a high crash site? Is it the location of fatal crashes?

Richardson Avenue is another future disaster in the making. The plan is to do the same configuration on this commuter arterial. Crash rates and vehicle volume do not justify the proposed suicide-lane modifications. Residents are up in arms and cyclists are not of one mind when it comes to these revolutionary changes.

• If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it! This phrase comes to mind when referencing not only Richardson, but also Vancouver street. Richardson is a connector street, and a low stress way to get to and from the Tweed Curtain, known as Oak Bay. The death rate on Richardson must be astronomically high for such changes to be proposed. It is not!

The Vancouver Street directional changes are different than others referenced. The plan is to do major capital expense, namely concrete and stationary construction, in order to physically block and re-route motor vehicle traffic. Vancouver Street will no longer be a through street for motor vehicles. The 4,000 to 5,000 vehicles using the street will be diverted to Quadra or Cook. These streets are already stressed during morning and afternoon commutes.

Why are any of these projects being considered at this time of municipal financial crisis?

City council would be wise to delay in this time of a never before experienced financially stressful pandemic.

2018

article continues below

Aug. 22: A New York court issues a warrant for the arrest of Huawei Technologies chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.

Dec. 1: Canadian authorities arrest Meng at Vancouver's airport after an extradition request from the Americans. The news becomes public on Dec. 5.

Dec. 6: China demands Canada release Meng and ""immediately correct the mistake"" officials made in arresting her. The Chinese say they were not briefed on the reasons for Meng's arrest. In Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Meng's case is part of an independent legal process with no outside political influence.

Dec. 7: Meng appears in a Vancouver court, where allegations of fraud are laid out. The U.S. alleges Meng misled American banks in a bid to get around American sanctions on Iran.

Dec. 8: Canada's ambassador to China, John McCallum, is summoned to a meeting with China's assistant foreign minister so the country can register complaints about Meng's arrest.

Dec. 9: China summons the American ambassador to China to lodge similar complaints about Meng's case and demand the U.S. rescind the order for her arrest.

Dec. 10: Chinese authorities arrest two Canadian men. Michael Kovrig, who was on leave from Global Affairs Canada, and entrepreneur Michael Spavor. Kovrig's arrest becomes public on Dec. 11. Spavor's becomes public on Dec. 12.

Dec. 11: Meng is released on $10 million bail. U.S. President Donald Trump tells Reuters that he would ""certainly intervene"" in Meng's case ""if I thought it was necessary"" to help forge a trade deal with China.

Dec. 12: China's foreign ministry says it has no information about Kovrig but says the organization he worked with — the International Crisis Group — was not registered in China, making its activities in the country illegal.

Dec. 13: Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, says the arrests of the two Canadians were plainly a response to Meng's arrest. China's foreign ministry says Kovrig and Spavor have been detained on suspicion of ""endangering national security.""

Dec. 14: Canadian officials are granted consular access to Kovrig, and McCallum meets with him in Beijing.

Dec. 16: Canadian diplomats in China are granted consular access to Spavor.

Dec. 20: Indictments unsealed in the United States allege two Chinese citizens targeted companies in Canada and around the world as part of a years-long hacking campaign to steal data.

Dec. 21: Kovrig's employer, the International Crisis Group, says he has not been given access to a lawyer while in custody. A source familiar with the conditions of Kovrig's detention says he is questioned three times a day and kept in a room with the lights on continuously. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland formally demands both men be let go, calling in a statement ""for their immediate release."" Similar statements come out from the United States, Britain and the European Union.

Dec. 24: China's foreign ministry calls out the U.S., Britain and EU, saying the trio should be condemning Canada for Meng's arrest.

2019

Jan. 3: At a news conference, China's prosecutor general Zhang Jun says Kovrig and Spavor ""without a doubt"" violated Chinese law. He says the investigation is also following the rule of law but doesn't provide more details about the allegations.

Jan. 7: The Prime Minister's Office says Trump has affirmed his respect for judicial independence. In a summary of a phone call between Trump and Trudeau, the PMO indicated the leaders discussed the high-profile U.S. extradition request — though Meng was not named — and agreed on the importance of respecting the independence of judges and the rule of law.

Jan. 9: China's envoy in Ottawa suggests Canada and its Western allies are white supremacists for calling for the release of two Canadians imprisoned last month by his country's communist government. Ambassador Lu Shaye makes the accusation in an op-ed in the Hill Times.

Jan. 14: Trudeau says he's very concerned to see China ""acting arbitrarily"" by applying the death penalty to a Canadian convicted of drug trafficking. He says Canada will do all it can to intervene on Robert Lloyd Schellenberg's behalf when a court in Dalian in northeastern Liaoning province announced it had given Schellenberg the death penalty after reconsidering his case.

Jan. 15: China expresses its ""strong dissatisfaction"" with Trudeau over his criticism of Schellenberg's sentence. Trudeau should ""respect the rule of law, respect China's judicial sovereignty, correct mistakes and stop making irresponsible remarks,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying says.

Jan. 16: The U.S. State Department says China's death sentence against Schellenberg is ""politically motivated."" A statement says U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Freeland spoke and ""expressed their concerns about the arbitrary detentions and politically motivated sentencing of Canadian nationals.""

Jan. 17: Ambassador Shaye says Canada's arrest of Meng was an act of ""backstabbing"" by a friend. Lu warns of ""repercussions"" if Canada bars the firm from its new 5G network for security reasons, as have three of its intelligence-sharing allies.

Jan. 18: Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale says the government's decision on whether to ban Huawei from being used in Canada's next generation 5G wireless network will not be influenced by threats of retaliation from China.

Jan. 22: China demands the U.S. drop a request that Canada extradite Meng. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Meng's case was out of the ordinary and Canada's extradition treaty with the U.S. infringed on the ""safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens.""

Jan. 23: Ambassador McCallum says there are strong legal arguments Meng can make to help her avoid extradition to the United States. Speaking to Chinese reporters a day earlier in the Toronto area, McCallum listed several arguments Meng's legal team can make in her defence.

Jan. 24: Trudeau dismisses calls to remove McCallum following his comments to Chinese reporters, saying such a change wouldn't help the two Canadians detained by Chinese authorities get home any sooner. Later, McCallum says he ""misspoke"" when he suggested detained Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou had a strong case to avoid extradition to the United States.

Jan. 25: McCallum tells StarMetro Vancouver it would be ""great for Canada"" if the United States drops its extradition request. ""We have to make sure that if the U.S. does such a deal, it also includes the release of our two people. And the U.S. is highly aware of that,"" he told the Star.

Jan. 26: McCallum resigns as ambassador to China at Trudeau's request.

Jan. 28: The U.S. Department of Justice formally levels criminal charges against Huawei, two subsidiaries and Meng. The charges, contained in two newly unsealed indictments, allege that Huawei misrepresented its ownership of a Hong Kong-based subsidiary to circumvent American sanctions against Iran. Furthermore, they say Huawei stole telecommunications technology, trade secrets and equipment from U.S. cellphone provider T-Mobile USA. Meng is charged with bank fraud, wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit both. In a statement, Huawei denied committing any of the violations cited in the indictment.

Jan. 29: The Canadian government says it has received a formal request for the extradition of Meng, who appears in a Vancouver court to change the people who are providing her with some of the financial sureties for her release.

March 1: The Justice Department gives the formal go-ahead for the extradition case to proceed.

March 3: Meng's defence team announces it has filed a notice of civil claim alleging ""serious violations"" of their client's constitutional rights.

March 4: China accuses the two detained Canadians of acting together to steal state secrets. Trudeau dismissed the allegation made in Chinese state media, saying: ""It is unfortunate that China continues to move forward on these arbitrary detentions.""

March 6: A lawyer for Meng tells a judge the United States bid for extradition raises serious concerns about the political motivations behind the case.

March 14: Huawei pleads not guilty in a New York court to charges accusing it of plotting to violate Iran trade sanctions. Lawyers enter the plea in federal court in Brooklyn, two weeks after Huawei pleaded not guilty to separate federal charges filed in Seattle accusing the company of stealing technology from T-Mobile.

March 22: A judge orders the RCMP to provide copies of the content on seven electronic devices owned by Meng after they were seized when she was arrested. Justice Heather Holmes of the British Columbia Supreme Court says the RCMP must make copies of data on an iPhone, an iPad, a Macbook Air, a Huawei phone, two SIM cards and a flash drive.

March 29: The federal government says it is considering subsidizing farmers hit by China's $2-billion ban on Canadian canola imports.

April 29: Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe says Ottawa needs to treat Chinese imports with the same scrutiny China is showing Canada's canola shipments.

May 1: The federal government changes a payment program for canola farmers to help those affected by China's decision to ban the Canadian product.

May 2: China suspends the export permits of two Canadian pork exporters, including Quebec-based Olymel LP, amid growing tensions between the two countries.

May 8: Meng's defence team tells a judge it plans to argue that she shouldn't be extradited to the United States because she hasn't committed fraud under Canadian laws and her arrest was unlawful.

May 9: Canadian diplomats are joined in a Chinese courtroom by American, British, French and German colleagues to watch an appeal in Schellenberg's case.

May 16: China says it has formally arrested Kovrig and Spavor, bringing them closer to trial on vaguely defined state security charges. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman says they have been arrested for allegedly stealing state secrets. Goodale says the federal government is ""deeply concerned"" about China's decision, adding that no evidence has been produced to indicate any validity to allegations made against them.

May 23: China's ambassador to Canada says the bilateral relationship is at ""rock bottom"" compared to any time since diplomatic ties were first established decades ago. In prepared text for a speech, Lu Shaye says he's saddened Canada-China relations are at what he called a ""freezing point.""

June 5: Lawyers for the RCMP and Canada Border Services Agency deny allegations that their officers searched Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou's phones and electronic devices after a border official wrote down her passwords. A joint response filed in court to Meng's civil lawsuit says a border officer asked Meng for her phone numbers and passwords in case he was required to search the devices for customs or immigration purposes. Meng's civil lawsuit filed in B.C. Supreme Court alleges ""serious violations"" of her constitutional rights and accuses officers of detaining and questioning her for three hours before notifying her of her arrest.

June 13: Freeland rejects the purported view of former prime minister Jean Chretien that the extradition request be cancelled to improve relations with China and win the release of Kovrig and Spavor. Freeland said while she respects Chretien, Canada is either a rule of law country or it is not. Chretien's comments were reported in the Globe and Mail citing anonymous sources.

June 24: Defence lawyers for Meng ask Ottawa to stop the extradition process against their client, saying the request made by the United States was for political purposes, not legitimate law enforcement reasons.

Aug. 20: Court documents released ahead of Meng's extradition hearing suggest a Canadian border official questioned her about her business before the RCMP arrested her. The nearly 1,100 pages of material released by the court were collected by Meng's defence team.

Aug. 21: Meng's lawyers allege Canadian officials acted as ""agents"" of American law enforcement while she was detained at Vancouver's airport for three hours ahead of her arrest. In court documents, they point to handwritten notes by Canadian officers indicating Meng's electronics were collected in anticipation of a request from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States.

Sept. 4. Business consultant Dominic Barton is named as Canada's new ambassador to China.

Sept. 23: The Crown says Canadian officials followed the law when they detained Meng and the defence has no proof to substantiate its ""conspiracy theory"" that she was illegally arrested. The Attorney General of Canada says in court documents that there's no evidence to suggest that the RCMP or the FBI asked border agents to elicit information from Meng during the detainment.

Sept. 24: A lawyer for Meng says there was nothing ""routine"" about the way she was questioned by border officials before she was read her rights and informed of her arrest as Meng's defence team asks the B.C. Supreme Court to compel the release of further documents to support its arguments ahead of her extradition hearing in January.

Oct. 1: A Crown prosecutor tells a judge Canadian border guards mistakenly gave the RCMP passcodes to electronic devices belonging to Meng when she was questioned at the Vancouver airport. The Crown says when the border agency realized it had made a mistake, it told the RCMP the codes could not be used or shared because they'd been obtained during a border examination.

Oct. 29: The federal government says Canada's new ambassador to China has met with Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

Oct. 31: In documents, Meng's lawyers maintain there is an ""air of reality"" to an allegation the RCMP illegally shared details of her electronic devices with the FBI, despite new affidavits from the Mounties denying the claim.

Nov. 5. A Chinese ban on the import of Canadian pork and beef products estimated to have cost farmers almost $100 million is lifted.

Nov. 24: Canada's new foreign affairs minister spends an hour in talks with his Chinese counterpart over the fate of Kovrig and Spavor. Francois-Philippe Champagne spoke with China's Wang Yi a day earlier at a G20 meeting of foreign ministers in Japan.

Nov. 28: Lawyers for Meng say the United States is ""dressing up"" its complaint that she violated sanctions as a case of fraud as they ask the B.C. Supreme Court to decline her extradition. In court documents released, Meng's legal team says the alleged misrepresentation does not amount to fraud and the transactions processed by HSBC were not illegal in Canada.

Dec. 2: Meng says she has experienced feelings of helplessness, torment and struggle since being arrested, but no longer fears the unknown. In a post on the Chinese telecom company's website, Meng says she has passed the time on bail in one of her homes in Vancouver reading books, chatting with colleagues and painting.

Dec. 10: Justice Minister David Lametti says he is troubled that Kovrig and Spavor have been denied access to lawyers as they face trials where convictions are virtually assured. Meanwhile, Meng wins an application in the B.C. Supreme Court for more documents to be disclosed as she alleges there was an abuse of process during her arrest.

2020

Jan. 23: A lawyer for Meng argues the extradition case against her is a test of whether courts will reject foreign charges that run contrary to Canadian values as a hearing wrapped up in the B.C. Supreme Court. The hearing focused on the legal test of double criminality. Crown counsel Robert Frater says the judge does not necessarily need to consider American sanctions law for the allegations to amount to fraud in Canada.

March 13: Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese Embassy in Canada says Kovrig has been allowed to have a telephone conversation with his father, who is very ill. The embassy says in a statement that they allowed the call for humanitarian reasons, and it also says Kovrig and fellow detainee Michael Spavor are being given better food to strengthen their immunity against the novel coronavirus.

May 27: Holmes rules against Meng on the double-criminality argument. The B.C. Supreme Court judge says the allegations against Meng could constitute a crime in Canada.

June 15: Lawyers for Meng accuse authorities in the United States of misleading the B.C. Supreme Court judge presiding over the extradition case. Meng's defence team says it is seeking a stay in the proceedings arguing that U.S. case records are ""grossly inaccurate and based on deliberate and/or reckless misstatements of fact and material omissions, thereby constituting a serious abuse of the extradition process.""

June 19: China charges Kovrig and Spavor with spying. Kovrig was charged in Beijing on suspicion of spying for state secrets and intelligence. Spavor was charged in Dandong city near the North Korean border on suspicion of spying for a foreign entity and illegally providing state secrets.

Aug. 25: Meng loses her battle to have the contents of six confidential documents released to her legal team after arguing in Federal Court that the redacted documents would support the position that their client suffered an abuse of process during her arrest. Justice Catherine Kane says the information contained in the documents is not relevant to the allegations of abuse described by Meng's legal team.

Verley later tweeted that she's now fine and ""in a really good head space.""

But when it comes time to book, King would rather see the world from the comfort of his home in Guelph, Ont.

""I can have a little espresso at my desk, and look all this stuff up, and it often feels like I've travelled there,"" King, 77, said in a recent phone interview.

""If I don't travel again, I don't know that I'll miss it.""

This weariness of wanderlust animates King's new novel, ""Indians on Vacation,"" which hit shelves Tuesday.

The story follows Canadian couple Mimi and Bird on a peripatetic mission across Europe to recover a family medicine bundle that a long-lost relative absconded with a century earlier.

As they drift from one destination to the next, the two must navigate their conflicting tourist temperaments.

Mimi, with her trusty guidebook in hand, believes that travel is ""broadening."" Meanwhile, Bird, like the book's author, is skeptical that there's much to be gained by straying too far from home.

""When we travel, a lot of times, the thing we come away with is we've been entertained,"" said King.

""I don't know that we feel any differently towards the people that we see on our travels. We find them interesting, sometimes even exotic. And for a moment, perhaps we have a kind of broadening. But I think by the time people get home, that's tightened up again.""

If anything, travel can show that prejudice knows no borders, said King, who was born in the U.S. and is of Greek and Cherokee descent.

From mountain towns to major cities, King said he's often confronted by racist stereotypes of Indigenous Peoples while abroad, including a photographer in France who asked him to pose with a pool stick as if it were a spear.

""What they want is that inauthentic historical image that Hollywood has made up over the years,"" said King.

""It's always the one kind of Indian they've got because the others don't play well visually. Me in a T-shirt and a pair of walking shorts — God forbid anybody see me in walking shorts — that just doesn't do it.""

In writing ""Indians on Vacation,"" King said he wanted to ""play against type"" by depicting Indigenous characters who are well-off enough to travel the world, while still engaging with the historic inequities that have made such portrayals a rarity in popular culture.

As the COVID-19 pandemic has closed down borders, King won't have to endure airplane food, forced photo-ops or guided walking tours any time soon.

But he still longs for a time when he could plan his dream vacation — then decide not to take it of his own accord.

""I don't need to go to Ireland,"" King said. ""But I don't like the fact that I can't.""

The lengthy report from the Special Investigations Unit notes that Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked ""important conversations"" about the ways in which police interact with Black and Indigenous people, but says there was no evidence of police wrongdoing or ""overt"" racism in the incident itself.

article continues below

Director Joseph Martino said race may have been a factor in the events leading up to the death of the 29-year-old, who was both Indigenous and Black, but that examining systemic issues in policing is not his role.

""The task before me was a narrow one — namely, to determine whether there were reasonable grounds, on the evidence collected by the SIU, to believe that any one or more of the officers who responded to Ms. Korchinski-Paquet's apartment committed a criminal offence in connection with her death,"" he wrote.

The Special Investigations Unit said six officers were in the 29-year-old woman's Toronto home when she fell from the balcony in May, while her mother and brother were nearby.

The agency's report says Korchinski-Paquet's mother called police to the home because the two siblings were fighting — ""bottles and punches had been thrown"" — and she wanted both of them removed from the apartment.

It says Korchinski-Paquet and her brother also called 911 during the argument, which began as a dispute over the volume of the TV.

When the 911 operator asked about any mental health issues, the report says, the family indicated that Korchinski-Paquet had epilepsy and had had seizures earlier in the day.

It says that after police arrived, two officers blocked Korchinski-Paquet from getting to her mother and brother before allowing her back into the apartment so she could use the bathroom.

She then went out onto the 24th-floor balcony and prevented officers from joining her by holding her body against the door.

""Very quickly, Ms. Korchinski-Paquet scaled the balcony railing and the (subject officer) lost sight of her,"" the report reads.

She then tried to scale the balcony and cross onto the adjoining one, which is when she lost her balance and fell to her death, the report reads.

The agency said no officers were on the balcony with Korchinski-Paquet at the time, and there's no evidence the officers committed a crime.

Martino said that the officers seemed to be confused about whether epilepsy was a mental health condition and if they should or could detain Korchinski-Paquet under the Mental Health Act.

""The limited layperson's research I have conducted of the matter suggests that epilepsy is a neurological disorder with manifestations that can be mental as well as physical,"" Martino wrote. ""Be that as it may, I cannot fault the officers for failing to take Ms. Korchinski-Paquet into custody prior to her scaling the balcony railing. She had not given them any indication that she wished to harm herself and was professing to be the victim of an assault at the hands of her brother.""

He also said the officers tried to de-escalate the situation between Korchinski-Paquet's family.

The decision comes after the arm's-length agency interviewed all six officers, along with 15 civilian witnesses.

The agency said investigators also received a written statement from Korchinski-Paquet's father, with whom she had been speaking on the phone moments before her death.

Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked protests in the city and calls to change the way police deal with people experiencing mental health crises.

Martino noted that Korchinski-Paquet died just days after George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, was killed when an officer pressed a knee against his neck for nearly nine minutes, at a time when there was increased scrutiny over the relationship between police and racialized people.

In Toronto, thousands of protesters took to the streets on May 30, three days after the incident in Korchinski-Paquet's apartment. Several smaller marches followed it over the next several weeks.

Two city counsellors then brought forward a motion to defund Toronto police, but it was struck down in favour of introducing body-worn cameras to the force.

The Toronto Police Services Board, the body that oversees the force, then launched a series of town halls to discuss systemic racism in policing, though many protesters said such information-gathering had been done before to little effect.

Toronto police and Korchinski-Paquet’s family were expected to comment on the SIU report at separate news conferences later Wednesday.

Other speakers tonight include senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, who is leaving the White House at the end of the month, and Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn.

A devout Catholic, Pence and wife Karen are expected to carry the evangelical banner into Day 3 of the convention, touting Trump as the best choice for Americans who consider themselves social conservatives.

Democrats seized on the opportunity, deploying the openly gay Pete Buttigieg, one of Joe Biden's former presidential rivals, in a fundraising missive denouncing Pence's ""divisive, anti-LGBTQ politics"" and ""archaic worldview.""

As head of the White House coronavirus force, Pence is also likely to address an issue that has so far received relatively scant attention from convention speakers: the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Tuesday, economic adviser Larry Kudlow spoke of the crisis in the past tense, even though the pandemic continues to rage across the U.S., while only first lady Melania Trump expressed any empathy for the more than 178,000 Americans killed by the virus to date.

""My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one, and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering,"" she said. ""I know many people are anxious, and some feel helpless. I want you to know you are not alone.""

Kudlow, meanwhile, framed the novel coronavirus as ancient history in the U.S.

""It was awful — health and economic impacts were tragic, hardship and heartbreak were everywhere,"" Kudlow said. ""But presidential leadership came swiftly and effectively, with an extraordinary rescue for health and safety to successfully fight the COVID virus.""

Of the racial unrest roiling the country — fuelled this week by another police shooting of an unarmed Black man, this time in Wisconsin — Melania Trump urged protesters to channel their furious energy into positive change, not wanton destruction. She also resisted the urge to ""divide the country further"" by beating up on Democrats.

But she raised eyebrows by framing her husband, notorious for playing fast and loose with the truth, as an honest and authentic human being.

""Total honesty is what we as citizens deserve from our president,"" she said. ""Whether you like it or not, you always know what he's thinking.""

Trump has been putting the power of the presidency under a brazen partisan spotlight, and did so again Tuesday, pardoning a convicted bank robber who now helps prisoners reintegrate into society and presiding over a naturalization ceremony for five new American citizens. His wife's speech was delivered from the White House Rose Garden.

And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's pre-taped speech from a Jerusalem rooftop, coming in the middle of a diplomatic mission, did not escape the attention of some members of Congress. Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is accusing Pompeo of violating federal law by mixing government business with partisan interests.

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""","INVERMAY, Sask. — People could always tell when Aaron Ogden entered a room.

The 19-year-old had a big presence, said his father, Mark Ogden. He was a prankster, a one-of-a-kind character who would sit and talk to anybody as if he'd known them for years.

article continues below

""He wasn't afraid to make friends,"" Ogden, 50, said in a phone interview. ""This is just the way he was.

""Really easy to talk to.""

People remembered the young man's outgoing personality at his funeral this week. He died in a Calgary hospital last Saturday after collapsing on a run.

His father, a trucker, was able to be by his son's side.

He said a major blood clot had formed around a stent placed in his son's aorta. The stent was necessary after he survived a serious highway accident on his way to work last year.

""It was a miracle, really.""

Ogden said while in hospital before his death, his son told him he was supposed to go for a CT scan in June while still living in Saskatchewan near Yorkton.

It was a routine checkup on the stent, but the appointment was postponed because of restrictions around the COVID-19 pandemic and never rescheduled.

""I didn't think nothing of it at the time, but I mulled it over ... as we watched him decline,"" Ogden said.

""It hit me. He was trying to tell me: 'This shouldn't have happened.'""

The father believes that had his son's scan not been cancelled, doctors might have found the blood clot in time.

Ogden wants all postponed hospital procedures done immediately.

""People's lives are being lost,"" he said. ""These COVID rules are way too far.""

Ogden believes the Saskatchewan Health Authority bears responsibility for his son's death.

""Somebody needs to be held to account.""

The health authority halted hundreds of non-urgent surgeries, procedures and diagnostics in March to brace for the pandemic.

Two months later, when the government felt it had a handle on the spread of the novel coronavirus, it announced the resumption of health services would be staggered.

""Emergency and urgent patients are the priority for services, including diagnostic imaging,"" said Corey Miller, vice-president of provincial programs at the health authority.

""The determination of the priority is based on the evaluation of the referring physician in consultation with the patient.""

Miller said they are reviewing Ogden's case and have reached out to his family.

He said the health authority is working through the backlog of exams that were delayed during the first few months of the pandemic.

More than 1,500 CT appointments which had been booked were postponed, he said.

Ogden questions why something like a CT scan couldn't be performed in Yorkton, where the risk of COVID-19 was low.

As of Friday, health officials reported five active cases in the region, which has only seen 33 infections in total since the pandemic hit Saskatchewan.

Cheryl Camillo, a professor with the University of Regina's Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy, says speaking generally, delaying non-essential services to respond to COVID-19 was the responsible thing to do because the virus was new and spreading quickly.

""The risks are that some people don't get the essential and urgent services because so much of the workforce and the resources of the health system move towards responding to COVID,"" said the health systems researcher.

""It's very human for people to get frustrated because health care is something that is so personal.""

She says another risk of scaling back is that people can lose confidence in a health system some may perceive as having overplanned for the pandemic.

Health officials are in the tough spot of having to prepare for the worst case scenario and what could be a rapid change in case numbers, she says.

During the pandemic Camillo's own grandmother died in a long-term care home in the United States from isolation and depression, she says.

""I suffered an individual loss of my otherwise pretty healthy grandmother, but despite how profoundly sad that makes me, I understand and would defend the care home's decision to lock down.

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""

Loblaw Companies Ltd., which began offering COVID-19 testing for patients at a handful of its Alberta pharmacy locations in June, plans to expand the program to all 234 of its pharmacies in the province by Sept. 1.

article continues below

The company says it has reached out to all 10 provinces to discuss in-store testing outside Alberta, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford this week acknowledging the possibility.

The swab tests are only for those with no symptoms or any known contact with coronavirus patients and may be useful for teachers returning to school or Canadians who take care of an older family member, said Theresa Firestone, head of health and wellness at Shoppers Drug Mart. Loblaw-owned pharmacy locations include Shoppers stores as well as Independent Foods and No Frills.

""It's very convenient. We're in every community. The other plus is they don't have to line up with people who may have symptoms. We've shared that with Ontario and with other provinces, so at this point we’re looking forward to what they may decide,"" Firestone said.

London Drugs also conducts COVID-19 tests in Alberta. It began offering the service at six locations during the past two weeks and plans to roll it out at nine more by October. Like Shoppers, it bills Alberta Health Services for testing costs.

The service builds on other responses to the pandemic such as online pharmacist consultations and a pilot program where patients consult virtually with doctors in a private room in the store.

London Drugs is among the pharmacy retailers beefing up their role in a health-care system grappling with an aging population.

""With the extended hours of operation, you can basically go in when our stores are open and be able to find a pharmacist to ask a question. So what we’re able to do at that point is basically help triage the system,"" said Chris Chiew, head of pharmacy at the Richmond, B.C.-based retailer.

London Drugs has also hired diabetes educators to test blood sugar levels and assist patients with weight management and diet.

Shoppers has stepped even further into the realm of physicians, opening one of three planned medical clinics with doctors who cater to a roster of patients and walk-in services.

""There are a number of Canadians who don’t have access to a family physician. And we thought there was an opportunity for us to really play a role here in terms of access,"" Firestone said.

Drugstores can also handle the bureaucratic side of health care, freeing up doctors to spend more time with patients, she said.

""Looking for PPE (personal protective equipment), sorting out their waiting rooms so that people are socially distanced, managing virtual care...we’re able to take that burden on for them,"" Firestone said.

In 2018, Shoppers launched its Wellwise store chain to sell assisted-living devices aimed at older Canadians. More recently, it began to offer tips and videos online designed to help ward off depression and anxiety.

Metro Inc. declined to comment on any attempts to provide COVID-19 testing. The bulk of the company's Jean Coutu drugstores are located in Quebec, which unlike some provinces does not allow pharmacists to conduct testing via nose and mouth swabs.

Bank of Nova Scotia. (TSX:BNS). Down 38 cents, or 0.67 per cent, to $56.10. The Bank of Nova Scotia's profit was weighed down in its latest quarter by mounting provisions for bad loans and its Latin American operations. The Toronto-based bank revealed Tuesday that its third-quarter profit slipped to $1.3 billion from $1.98 billion a year ago, while its provisions for credit losses totalled $2.18 billion for the quarter, up from $1.85 billion last quarter and $713 million in the year prior. ""We know that structural damage has been done to the economy. It's going to require a lot of quarters of clean up from here, but we do view this quarter's PCL as our high-water mark,"" Daniel Moore, the bank's chief risk officer, said during a conference call with financial analysts.

Bank of Montreal (TSX:BMO). Up $4.38 cents, or 5.7 per cent, to $81.23. BMO Financial Group put aside a hefty amount of money again to protect itself from bad loans even as it posted a $1.23-billion profit in its latest quarter. The Toronto-based bank said Tuesday that provisions for credit losses amounted to $1.05 billion in its third quarter, up from $306 million last year and down from $1.11 billion last quarter. Patrick Cronin, the bank's chief risk officer, attributed the high provisions to the COVID-19 pandemic, but said he has confidence in the bank's ability to operate in such an environment.

The Canadian Association of Broadcasters issued a report on Wednesday warning of potential closures and widespread job cuts as private TV and radio broadcasters face a cumulative projected revenue shortfall of up to $1.06 billion by the end of 2022.

Most vulnerable are the country's AM radio stations, the report said, as well as other independent private radio and TV operations in smaller markets across the country.

The study, titled ""The Crisis in Canadian Media and the Future of Local Broadcasting,"" was commissioned by the CAB, which represents the majority of private broadcasters in Canada, and conducted through Winnipeg-based independent media economics consultancy Communications Management Inc.

The CAB says it's concerned about the fallout from a substantial erosion in local advertising revenues over recent months.

Radio stations may be hardest hit in the short term, the report suggests, partly due to many advertisers pulling back on their spending in the pandemic and hastening a decline in the media industry's revenues.

Private radio ad revenues are expected to be $383 million below last year, it said.

The report's projections suggest that without further government support those declines could mean as many as 50 private local radio stations go out of business over the next four to six months.

Another 150 radio stations could topple in the 18 months that follow, it said, leading to as many as 2,000 job losses.

TV stations could risk a similar fate with roughly 40 of Canada's 94 private TV broadcasters in danger of closing within one to three years, the research predicts.

The CAB is calling on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to take swift action by establishing a ""more fair and sustainable future"" for local media.

Last month, the organization sent an emergency application to the CRTC requesting permission for broadcasters to be relieved of certain terms of their agreements, such as spending requirements on Canadian programming, for the broadcast year that ends Aug. 31.

Lenore Gibson, chair of the CAB, said broadcasters have ""done their utmost to cut expenses"" in areas such as administration, and ""the last thing that they want to do is cut into programming costs, but that's the only area that's left now.""

The CAB is urging the federal government to provide emergency regulatory relief as well as greater ""targeted support"" for the industry starting this fall.

Without greater financial measures in place, the CAB says the effects could leave many communities with only national and international media organizations to provide them with most of their news, effectively eliminating most community coverage of local politics, health and education in some regions of the country.

Bo Horvat scored twice, and Tyler Toffoli and Elias Pettersson each had a goal and two assists as the Canucks defeated the Golden Knights 5-2 at Rogers Place.

The best-of-seven second-round series is tied 1-1. Game 3 goes Thursday.

Forty-eight hours earlier, the Golden Knights, now 8-2 in the post-season, had manhandled the Canucks en route to a 5-0 pounding in Game 1.

""For us as a team we wanted to bounce back from Game 1. We weren't happy with that,"" said Pettersson.

""We played a good game. We should be happy about it but (we need) a short-term memory and be ready for Game 3.""

Goaltender Jacob Markstrom made 38 saves for the win while Robin Lehner stopped 22 shots for Vegas. It's the first time Vegas has allowed more than five goals in a game in the return-to-play tournament.

It was the first game back for Toffoli since the opening game of the qualifying round against the Minnesota Wild on Aug. 2. The NHL is not releasing information on injuries, but Toffoli had been seen in a walking boot.

Toffoli jumped over the boards for his first shift in the first period and scored nine seconds later, taking a cross-crease pass from Pettersson to put the puck into a yawning net. He then made it 2-0 on the power play, delivering a tape-to-tape pass to an incoming Horvat, who blasted it past Lehner.

""It's fun to get back in the lineup and get a big win and tie this series up,"" said Toffoli, who had been acquired at the trade deadline from the Los Angeles Kings. He had put up 10 points in his first 10 games with the Canucks before the regular season ended March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I made some phone calls yesterday, talked to a lot of people. It was a busy day,"" said Toffoli. ""It was good obviously getting the OK from everybody (to play). I got all excited. Felt like I was coming back to my first playoff series.""

Vancouver coach Travis Green said the 5-0 loss was their worst game of the playoffs and that Game 2 was a must-win.

""You go down two (games) against that team early in the series it would be tough and just mentally, too (to come back),"" he said.

""We were better with the puck, played a more direct game. I thought we were better on our feet, quicker. That's a good hockey team. I thought we did a good job of making them defend more than we did the first game.""

Despite being down by two goals in the second period, the Golden Knights looked like they were going to run the Canucks out of the rink again.

Markstrom kept the Canucks alive as Vegas tilted the ice and turned his net into a shooting gallery, blasting away for 22 shots in the period. Vegas got one goal back from Alex Tuch before Pettersson scored on a cross-ice feed from Alex Edler to make it 3-1 heading into the third.

""That really was a back-breaker,"" said Vegas head coach Peter DeBoer. ""You're down 3-1 and you have nothing to show for the work you put in to try and get back in the game.""

Tuch added: ""We knew Vancouver wasn't happy with the way they played last game and we knew they were going to come out flying. And we decided instead of being prepared, (to) be surprised by that for some reason.""

Vancouver iced the game 18 seconds into the third on Horvat's second goal. Then the frustration finally got to Vegas.

First, Max Pacioretty grabbed J.T. Miller by the head and threw him down after the whistle for a roughing penalty. Tuch got a double minor for pummelling Jake Virtanen while the Vancouver forward lay on the ice.

Pacioretty scored late for Vegas and Tanner Pearson added the final Vancouver goal into an empty net.

Horvat had not found the scoresheet since scoring two goals in each of the first two games against the St. Louis Blues in the first round.

Pettersson has been a steady point-getter throughout the playoffs but had been shut down by Vegas in Game 1, limited to no shots on net and one blocked shot.

Markstrom, in his first playoff series, has been the locomotive pulling the Canucks' playoff train. He allowed just nine goals on 121 shots (.926 save percentage) against Minnesota in the first round while registering his first playoff shutout. He saved 29 of 34 against the Blues (.930).

The series is being played at a fan-less Rogers Place. Players are isolating between contests to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This was Williams’ fifth match since professional tennis resumed amid the coronavirus pandemic after a hiatus of nearly six months — and all five have gone three sets. She is 3-2 in that stretch.

The result against No. 13 seed Sakkari, and particularly the way the match ended, was hardly promising for Williams as the U.S. Open’s start approaches next week.

The Western & Southern Open is usually held in Ohio but was moved to the U.S. Open’s site in Flushing Meadows this year to make for a two-event, no-spectator ""bubble"" during the pandemic.

In men's play, Canada's Milos Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Andy Murray. Raonic, from Thornhill, Ont., is the last Canadian remaining in the draw.

Williams was seemingly in control early, serving for the first set at 5-3, 30-0, when things began to unravel. She missed two backhands in a row, then put a forehand into the net to set up a break point, and walked over to the stand holding her towel at the back of the court (the ball people normally handle towels for players, but not during COVID-19).

That’s when chair umpire Aurelie Tourte called a time violation. On the following point, Williams sailed a forehand long to get broken.

At the ensuing changeover, the 23-time Grand Slam champion argued with Tourte, saying: ""I mean, I’m getting my own towels. That’s not fair. You should tell me on the sidelines next time if I need to play faster. Believe me, I will. ... You didn't even give me a warning.""

While Williams eventually did grab that set, she again frittered away a 5-3 lead in the second, plus a 4-1 edge in the tiebreaker. When she sat after the second set, the 38-year-old American tossed her racket over her shoulder the way an office worker might flip a crumpled piece of paper toward a trash can.

Williams came out flat in the third set, as if she’d rather be anywhere else. She double-faulted four times in the second game, including on Sakkari’s eighth break chance, to make it 2-0 and that was pretty much that.

Hours earlier, Novak Djokovic’s neck felt much better, and his tennis looked much better, in a 6-2, 6-4 victory over unseeded American Tennys Sandgren that improved the No. 1-ranked man to 20-0 in 2020.

""Actually, I’m pleasantly surprised with the way I recovered and felt today — just overall, physically, but also with the neck, specifically, because that was a little bit of a concern,"" said Djokovic, who will be eyeing his 18th Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open. ""Going back four, five days, I did struggle quite a lot.""

Djokovic was treated by a trainer and played sluggishly in his opening match Monday, but he was at his best from the outset against Sandgren and saved all four break points he faced.

Djokovic will face 34th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff in the quarterfinals. The other quarterfinal in the top half of the draw will be defending champion Daniil Medvedev against No. 8 seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Reilly Opelka, a 6-foot-11 American who is ranked 39th, delivered 19 aces and knocked off 2019 U.S. Open semifinalist Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 7-6 (4). Opelka next meets No. 4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, whose 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4) win over No. 16 John Isner was interrupted by a rain delay of nearly 1 1/2 hours late in the first set.

Also interrupted by the weather was Raonic's victory over the three-time Grand Slam champion. Raonic, a Wimbledon runner-up in 2016, has held all 29 games he’s served so far in the tournament.

""I have done the work,"" Raonic said. ""I have put in the effort, and I'm just happy that this quickly the pieces are coming together.""

This was Murray's first tournament appearance since November. He missed time due to a pelvic injury and is playing on a metal hip after two operations on that joint.

""Didn’t play well. It was not a good day,"" Murray said. ""The positives are that I got three matches in. Physically, I pulled up OK.""

Women’s quarterfinal matchups set earlier in the day were two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka against Anett Kontaveit, former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka against Ons Jabeur, and 83rd-ranked American qualifier Jessica Pegula against No. 14 Elise Mertens.

He was 5 under after the front nine Tuesday at Ozarks National when he hit driver at the par-4 10th. The ball wound up in such heavy rough that Mickelson couldn't find it, forcing him to take a penalty stroke. He still wound up making a long putt to salvage bogey, and that gave him some momentum for the rest of the round.

""I was able to get right back to even par on the back side with a birdie on the next hole, and then I made a couple more coming in,"" said Mickelson, whose 7-under 64 left him 17 under.

That was good for a four-shot lead over Tim Petrovic and Rod Pampling, who will be his playing partners for the final round. Mike Weir of Bright's Grove, Ont., (69) was nine shots off the lead at 8 under.

""I've been putting really well,"" Mickelson said. ""Today I didn't drive it the way I've been driving it. I kind of a hung a few drives, so I'm going to the range and try to work on that now. But when I come out tomorrow I'll try to be a little bit more aggressive with the driver and see if I can make a few more birdies.""

A few more? He's already made 19 of them in his first 36 holes.

Playing in the final group and with the shadows getting long, Mickelson picked up right where he left off after his opening-round 61. He made birdie at the third and then rattled off three straight beginning at the par-4 fifth, where he nearly chipped in for eagle.

Petrovic tried to make a run at Mickelson, but even one of his career-low rounds only got him so close. His putter went cold down the stretch and a poor approach at the par-4 finishing hole resulted in bogey.

Mickelson added a bridie at the ninth, the only hole he bogeyed on Monday, after a pretty flop shot over the bunker. After the lost ball at the 10th, Mickelson responded by adding two more birdies.

The second of them at the par-3 12th was a backhanded tap-in. His approach shot barely carried onto the front edge of the green, then nestled up to about an inch from the hole.

Mickelson could still squander the lead in the final round Wednesday, when tee times were moved to the early morning because of expected bad weather in the afternoon. But given the quality of his short game through 36 holes, the more pressing question is whether he could break the PGA Tour Champions' 54-hole scoring record of 191 — shared by Bruce Fleisher, Loren Roberts, Bernhard Langer, David Frost and Rocco Mediate.

Mickelson, who decided to make his debut on the over-50 tour to continue his U.S. Open prep after he was eliminated from the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, would need to shoot 65 in his final round Wednesday to move atop the list.

Petrovic and Pampling each shot 64-65 over the first two rounds. Rocco Mediate struggled coming in and was at 12 under.

K.J. Choi was another shot back, and Steve Stricker and David McKenzie were at 10 under.

Moments later, the Chicago White Sox right-hander threw the final pitch in a truly bizarre performance.

article continues below

A no-fan no-no.

With the seats at Guaranteed Rate Field empty, Giolito pitched the first no-hitter of the pandemic-delayed season, striking out 13 in leading the White Sox over the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 Tuesday night.

""2020 has been a very strange year,"" said Giolito, who conducted a postgame interview while wearing a mask. ""Obviously a lot of weird stuff going on with COVID and the state of the world, so may as well throw this in the mix.""

Sounds like he didn't mind that nobody saw it. Well, almost no one.

After right fielder Adam Engel extended on the run to catch Erik Gonzalez’s slicing drive toward the line for the final out, the hollers of Giolito’s teammates in the middle of the diamond echoed around the stadium.

""I’m just stoked for Lucas and so happy and ecstatic and emotional for Lucas,"" Engel said. ""It stinks we couldn’t celebrate the way most no-hitters get celebrated.""

The smallest crowd listed for any no-hitter in the majors over the last 100 years came in 1944, when a mere 1,014 watched Cincinnati’s Clyde Shoun beat the Braves at Crosley Field.

Nowhere close to that number on this night, not with the park that holds over 40,000 closed to fans because of virus protocols.

Suffice to say, years from now when White Sox fans fondly remember Giolito’s gem, there will not be, say, 100,000 or so people claiming they were there to see it in person.

At one point early in the game, some members of grounds crew drifted in sight, but that was about it outside of the teams.

An All-Star last year, the 26-year-old Giolito (3-2) matched his career high for strikeouts set in his previous start against Detroit.

Only a four-pitch walk to Gonzalez leading off the fourth inning got in Giolito’s way of perfection. That was only runner he permitted while throwing 101 pitches

""I’ve been working for this type of game for a while now and it’s really cool that we got it done,"" Giolito said.

Giolito relied on his changeup and fastball to make quick work of the Pirates, who came into the game batting just .229 and have the worst record in the majors. Six of their starters finished the game hitting under .199 this season.

The White Sox rushed toward the mound after the final out in Giolito’s first career no-hitter. Giolito hugged catcher James McCann as the Chicago players joined the party.

The South Side of Chicago normally rattles with fireworks after a home win -- this is the club that gave the game the exploding scoreboard -- but the park remained silent as the dugout emptied.

Giolito, meanwhile, was locked in his own zone in the later innings, fully aware of what was at stake.

""After the seventh, six more outs, looking at who I was facing, became very, very, very possible,"" he said, ""and then we were able to get it done.""

Giolito said his approach never wavered.

""Just staying with the same, like, mental routine for every single pitch. One pitch at a time. Full focus, full execution, straight through the target,"" he said.

Giolito pitched the 19th no-hitter in White Sox history — second most to the Dodgers' 23 — and first since Philip Humber threw a perfect game at Seattle in 2012. This was the seventh time the Pirates have been held hitless, with Washington’s Max Scherzer having done it in 2015.

White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson made a nifty play on a grounder by Bryan Reynolds up the middle in the seventh to preserve the gem, helped by first baseman Jose Abreu’s stretch at the bag.

In the ninth, Gonzalez hit a liner that Engel, a fleet centre fielder for most of his career, caught on the run at knee-high height.

""Yeah man, I think I got it,"" Gonzalez said. ""With that at-bat, I was a little bit mad because I don’t want to be part of history.""

Giolito improved to 30-28 in his big league career. He made his debut with Washington in 2016, then was traded after that season to the White Sox in a package for outfielder Adam Eaton.

Giolito gave up a major league-high 118 earned runs in 2018, his first full season in Chicago.

""I was pretty much bottom of the league in almost every stat,"" Giolito said. ""I kind of had to ... learn from failure to learn my true potential.""

He added: ""I always envisioned that I’d throw a no-hitter in the big leagues.""

Giolito threw the first no-hitter at Guaranteed Rate Field since Minnesota’s Francisco Liriano did it in 2011.

The White Sox, who’ve won eight of their last nine, ended the Pirates’ season-best winning streak at three games.

Giolito was dominant in his previous start, too, fanning 13 against Detroit and allowing just three hits in seven innings. The victory over Pittsburgh was his third career shutout.

Chicago’s first three batters reached in the second and all three came home one at a time after Engel’s groundout and singles Anderson and Eloy Jimenez. McCann added a sacrifice fly in the third off Steven Brault (0-1).

His team gave up a goal he felt shouldn't have counted three minutes into the opening period and had a subsequent equalizer called back on a razor-thin offside challenge.

Down 1-0 in the series and playing well, Tampa Bay then grabbed its first lead in more than 110 minutes of action midway through the third period only to see Boston tie it up with under four minutes to go in regulation.

""Adversity strikes in the weirdest ways,"" Cooper said. ""You never know when it's going to happen.

""Sometimes you're just dealt ... a sandwich that doesn't taste very good, if you know what I mean.""

And deal with it they did.

Ondrej Palat scored at 4:40 of overtime as the Lightning defeated the Bruins 4-3 to even their second-round playoff series 1-1.

Blake Coleman added two goals in regulation for the Lightning, while Nikita Kucherov had the other. Andrei Vasilevskiy made 22 saves to get the win.

""If there was one message that was going on it was we liked everything that was going on about the game,"" Cooper said. ""I know it sounds so cliche, but we just had to stick with it. Some teams, if you have mental weakness at all, you're probably sitting there saying, 'Poor us.'

""But it's just not been this group. That's not how they operate.""

Brad Marchand buried his second of the night to tie things with under four minutes left in the third period for the Bruins, while Nick Ritchie also scored. David Pastrnak added two assists for Boston, which got 36 stops from Jaroslav Halak.

The teams don't have much time to digest the result, with Game 3 of the best-of-seven matchup set for Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET back inside the fan-less Scotiabank Arena.

Tampa, which beat the Columbus Blue Jackets in quintuple overtime of Game 1 in the opening round before closing out the series in the extra period of Game 5 on a pair of goals from Brayden Point, got the winner after Boston couldn't clear its zone.

Patrick Maroon tried a wraparound that Halak stopped, but Palat was there to bury the rebound to score his first of the post-season and send the Lightning pouring off their bench in celebration.

""It's obviously big-time frustrating any time you lose a game and especially in that fashion,"" Bruins centre Sean Kuraly said. ""We thought we were trending in the right direction, (thinking) momentum may be swinging our way. You get the puck close to the blue line a couple times and you don't get it out, and against a good team that's what happens.

""It ends up in the back of your net.""

Acquired prior to February's trade deadline from the New Jersey Devils, Coleman gave Tampa its first lead of the series at 10:40 of the third after taking a stretch pass from Victor Hedman. The Lightning centre moved in alone on Halak and snuck an off-speed shot through the five-hole after getting slashed by Bruins defenceman Connor Clifton.

Boston, however, responded with 3:58 left in regulation when Marchand finished off a pretty passing play. With the Bruins in the middle of a change — Patrice Bergeron would normally be on the ice — Kuraly took a feed from Pastrnak and quickly found Marchand to bury his sixth and knot things up.

The Bruins, who triumphed 3-2 in Game 1 on the back of Halak's 35-save performance, took a 2-1 lead with 5:27 left in the second on a power play when Pastrnak faked a one-timer before sliding a pass to Marchand at the side of the net.

Tampa responded 56 seconds later after some great work from Point. The diminutive centre twisted and turned in the Bruins zone before finding Kevin Shattenkirk, whose shot was tipped in by Kucherov for his third.

The Lightning dressed seven defencemen with Ryan McDonagh (undisclosed), who has averaged a team-high 26:07 of ice time in the post-season, out injured after leaving midway through the third period of Game 1. Veteran blue-liners Luke Schenn and Braydon Coburn drew in, while Carter Verhaeghe was scratched up front.

Boston owned the best record in the NHL when the league suspended its season because of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, but dropped to the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference after losing all three of its games in the round-robin portion of the restart.

The Bruins found their groove in the first round of the usual 16-team playoff bracket, disposing of the Carolina Hurricanes in five games.

Tampa, meanwhile, had the second-best mark in the East and was fourth overall when the schedule was halted. The Lightning finished second in the round-robin and then downed Columbus.

The Bruins jumped out to a 1-0 lead at 3:14 of Tuesday's first period after Tampa defenceman Zach Bogosian's stick disintegrated at the offensive blue line. Boston broke the other way, with Ritchie stuffing his first past Vasilevskiy, who thought he had the puck covered — much to Cooper's chagrin.

The Lightning responded a couple minutes later when Barclay Goodrow tipped Coburn's point shot up and over Halak. The Bruins, however, correctly challenged for offside after Point was a fraction of a second too slow exiting the Boston zone on the tag up.

Cooper fired a number of expletives at the officials when the call was reversed, but was back smiling on the bench after a surprising burst from an unlikely source eventually knotted the score.

Bogosian, a bruising blue-liner known mostly for his physical play, split two Boston defenders, and as he was getting knocked down fed a diving Coleman, who slid his second past Halak before crashing into the net at 12:42.

""I saw Bogo picking up some speed,"" Coleman said. ""He just kind of had that look in his eye like he was about to do something. I just made it a point to get up into play with him, try to give him an option.

""He made a heck of a play.""

It was also the first sign the Lightning weren't going to be fazed by that early adversity.

""Any time there's a mishap, you just turn the page,"" Cooper said of his roster. ""It was needed tonight, I'll tell you that, because they need to be rewarded for the work they were doing.

""And in the end, they were.""

The All-Star guard scored 35 points and the Los Angeles Clippers rolled past the Dallas Mavericks 154-111 on Tuesday night to take a 3-2 lead in their first-round Western Conference playoff series.

George had shot 29% in the series and endured fans' wrath on social media. He said he spoke to the team psychiatrist before Game 5.

""I mean, whatever it was, the bubble got the best of me,"" George said. ""I was just in a dark place. I really wasn’t here. I checked out. The past couple of games, it was just difficult.""

George said it didn't feel like the playoffs until his teammates decided to create the atmosphere that was lacking inside the NBA's Walt Disney World bubble.

""I came in with that mindset that this is Staples, we’re at home,"" he said. ""The place is packed. I really had to psych myself up. I thought the whole team took that and we ran with it. We created our own energy. We decided to dictate this game.""

Kawhi Leonard scored 32 points and Montrezl Harrell added 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers, who set a franchise record for points in a playoff game. Los Angeles can clinch the series on Thursday.

Dallas' Luka Doncic, who hit a game-winner at the buzzer in Game 4 to cap off a 43-point triple-double, was held to 22 points on 6-for-17 shooting.

Dallas coach Rick Carlisle was ejected in the third quarter of the testy game, which included six technicals and a flagrant-1 foul.

Doncic said Clippers forward Marcus Morris might have stepped on his ankle intentionally early in the third quarter.

""I don’t want to talk to him,"" Doncic said. ""He’s just saying a lot of bad stuff to me all the game. I don’t want to talk to him. I’ve just got to move on. Like I said, everybody’s going to have their own opinion. I just hope it wasn’t intentional. If that was intentional, that’s very bad.""

Mavericks centre Kristaps Porzingis sat out with right knee soreness. It was the second straight game the 7-foot-3 Latvian missed.

Leonard scored 22 points and Paul George scored 18 to help Los Angeles take a 76-52 lead at halftime. The Clippers shot 61% in the first half and led by as many as 27 points.

The Clippers continued the onslaught in the second half, bumping the lead to as many as 45 points.

""Tough game,"" Carlisle said. ""Very poor performance by us. It was disappointing. It was very physical. We just need to have a stronger physical disposition to start the game and throughout. We’ve got to get some more traction at both ends of the floor.""

TIP-INS

Mavericks: Doncic was issued a technical foul in the second quarter. ... G Tim Hardaway Jr. was called for a flagrant-1 after winding up and hitting George in the face on a drive. ... Assistant Stephen Silas took over as coach after Carlisle was ejected.

Clippers: Shot 67% from the field in the first quarter. ... Hardaway and Morris were called for double technicals in the second quarter. C Ivica Zubac was called for a technical in the third.

BIGGER THAN BASKETBALL

Clippers coach Doc Rivers was emotional while discussing the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which has sparked national outrage and some violent protests. Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back while his three children watched.

""That video, if you watch that video — you don’t need to be Black to be outraged,"" Rivers said. ""You need to be American and outraged. How dare the Republicans talk about fear. We’re the ones that need to be scared. We’re the ones having to talk to every Black child. What white father has to give his son a talk about being careful if you get pulled over? It’s just ridiculous. It keeps going. There’s no charges. Breonna Taylor — no charges. Nothing. All we’re asking is you live up to the Constitution. That’s all we’re asking -- for everybody. For everyone.""

CARLISLE'S EJECTION

Carlisle described what led to his ejection. Hardaway had the ball at the free-throw line, and then Rivers was granted a timeout.

""My understanding in that situation is that once a shooter has the ball, a timeout cannot be called by the opposing coach,"" Carlisle said. ""I thought the call was wrong. So I was asking about it and wasn’t getting a great explanation and then it turned into a technical and then another technical. I’m just standing up for my team.""

Game 6 is Thursday.

Loblaw Companies Ltd., which began offering COVID-19 testing for patients at a handful of its Alberta pharmacy locations in June, plans to expand the program to all 234 of its pharmacies in the province by Sept. 1.

article continues below

The company says it has reached out to all 10 provinces to discuss in-store testing outside Alberta, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford this week acknowledging the possibility.

The swab tests are only for those with no symptoms or any known contact with coronavirus patients and may be useful for teachers returning to school or Canadians who take care of an older family member, said Theresa Firestone, head of health and wellness at Shoppers Drug Mart. Loblaw-owned pharmacy locations include Shoppers stores as well as Independent Foods and No Frills.

""It's very convenient. We're in every community. The other plus is they don't have to line up with people who may have symptoms. We've shared that with Ontario and with other provinces, so at this point we’re looking forward to what they may decide,"" Firestone said.

London Drugs also conducts COVID-19 tests in Alberta. It began offering the service at six locations during the past two weeks and plans to roll it out at nine more by October. Like Shoppers, it bills Alberta Health Services for testing costs.

The service builds on other responses to the pandemic such as online pharmacist consultations and a pilot program where patients consult virtually with doctors in a private room in the store.

London Drugs is among the pharmacy retailers beefing up their role in a health-care system grappling with an aging population.

""With the extended hours of operation, you can basically go in when our stores are open and be able to find a pharmacist to ask a question. So what we’re able to do at that point is basically help triage the system,"" said Chris Chiew, head of pharmacy at the Richmond, B.C.-based retailer.

London Drugs has also hired diabetes educators to test blood sugar levels and assist patients with weight management and diet.

Shoppers has stepped even further into the realm of physicians, opening one of three planned medical clinics with doctors who cater to a roster of patients and walk-in services.

""There are a number of Canadians who don’t have access to a family physician. And we thought there was an opportunity for us to really play a role here in terms of access,"" Firestone said.

Drugstores can also handle the bureaucratic side of health care, freeing up doctors to spend more time with patients, she said.

""Looking for PPE (personal protective equipment), sorting out their waiting rooms so that people are socially distanced, managing virtual care...we’re able to take that burden on for them,"" Firestone said.

In 2018, Shoppers launched its Wellwise store chain to sell assisted-living devices aimed at older Canadians. More recently, it began to offer tips and videos online designed to help ward off depression and anxiety.

Metro Inc. declined to comment on any attempts to provide COVID-19 testing. The bulk of the company's Jean Coutu drugstores are located in Quebec, which unlike some provinces does not allow pharmacists to conduct testing via nose and mouth swabs.

The Canadian Association of Broadcasters issued a report on Wednesday warning of potential closures and widespread job cuts as private TV and radio broadcasters face a cumulative projected revenue shortfall of up to $1.06 billion by the end of 2022.

article continues below

Most vulnerable are the country's AM radio stations, the report said, as well as other independent private radio and TV operations in smaller markets across the country.

The study, titled ""The Crisis in Canadian Media and the Future of Local Broadcasting,"" was commissioned by the CAB, which represents the majority of private broadcasters in Canada, and conducted through Winnipeg-based independent media economics consultancy Communications Management Inc.

The CAB says it's concerned about the fallout from a substantial erosion in local advertising revenues over recent months.

Radio stations may be hardest hit in the short term, the report suggests, partly due to many advertisers pulling back on their spending in the pandemic and hastening a decline in the media industry's revenues.

Private radio ad revenues are expected to be $383 million below last year, it said.

The report's projections suggest that without further government support those declines could mean as many as 50 private local radio stations go out of business over the next four to six months.

Another 150 radio stations could topple in the 18 months that follow, it said, leading to as many as 2,000 job losses.

TV stations could risk a similar fate with roughly 40 of Canada's 94 private TV broadcasters in danger of closing within one to three years, the research predicts.

The CAB is calling on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to take swift action by establishing a ""more fair and sustainable future"" for local media.

Last month, the organization sent an emergency application to the CRTC requesting permission for broadcasters to be relieved of certain terms of their agreements, such as spending requirements on Canadian programming, for the broadcast year that ends Aug. 31.

Lenore Gibson, chair of the CAB, said broadcasters have ""done their utmost to cut expenses"" in areas such as administration, and ""the last thing that they want to do is cut into programming costs, but that's the only area that's left now.""

The CAB is urging the federal government to provide emergency regulatory relief as well as greater ""targeted support"" for the industry starting this fall.

Without greater financial measures in place, the CAB says the effects could leave many communities with only national and international media organizations to provide them with most of their news, effectively eliminating most community coverage of local politics, health and education in some regions of the country.

Bo Horvat scored twice, and Tyler Toffoli and Elias Pettersson each had a goal and two assists as the Canucks defeated the Golden Knights 5-2 at Rogers Place.

article continues below

The best-of-seven second-round series is tied 1-1. Game 3 goes Thursday.

Forty-eight hours earlier, the Golden Knights, now 8-2 in the post-season, had manhandled the Canucks en route to a 5-0 pounding in Game 1.

""For us as a team we wanted to bounce back from Game 1. We weren't happy with that,"" said Pettersson.

""We played a good game. We should be happy about it but (we need) a short-term memory and be ready for Game 3.""

Goaltender Jacob Markstrom made 38 saves for the win while Robin Lehner stopped 22 shots for Vegas. It's the first time Vegas has allowed more than five goals in a game in the return-to-play tournament.

It was the first game back for Toffoli since the opening game of the qualifying round against the Minnesota Wild on Aug. 2. The NHL is not releasing information on injuries, but Toffoli had been seen in a walking boot.

Toffoli jumped over the boards for his first shift in the first period and scored nine seconds later, taking a cross-crease pass from Pettersson to put the puck into a yawning net. He then made it 2-0 on the power play, delivering a tape-to-tape pass to an incoming Horvat, who blasted it past Lehner.

""It's fun to get back in the lineup and get a big win and tie this series up,"" said Toffoli, who had been acquired at the trade deadline from the Los Angeles Kings. He had put up 10 points in his first 10 games with the Canucks before the regular season ended March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I made some phone calls yesterday, talked to a lot of people. It was a busy day,"" said Toffoli. ""It was good obviously getting the OK from everybody (to play). I got all excited. Felt like I was coming back to my first playoff series.""

Vancouver coach Travis Green said the 5-0 loss was their worst game of the playoffs and that Game 2 was a must-win.

""You go down two (games) against that team early in the series it would be tough and just mentally, too (to come back),"" he said.

""We were better with the puck, played a more direct game. I thought we were better on our feet, quicker. That's a good hockey team. I thought we did a good job of making them defend more than we did the first game.""

Despite being down by two goals in the second period, the Golden Knights looked like they were going to run the Canucks out of the rink again.

Markstrom kept the Canucks alive as Vegas tilted the ice and turned his net into a shooting gallery, blasting away for 22 shots in the period. Vegas got one goal back from Alex Tuch before Pettersson scored on a cross-ice feed from Alex Edler to make it 3-1 heading into the third.

""That really was a back-breaker,"" said Vegas head coach Peter DeBoer. ""You're down 3-1 and you have nothing to show for the work you put in to try and get back in the game.""

Tuch added: ""We knew Vancouver wasn't happy with the way they played last game and we knew they were going to come out flying. And we decided instead of being prepared, (to) be surprised by that for some reason.""

Vancouver iced the game 18 seconds into the third on Horvat's second goal. Then the frustration finally got to Vegas.

First, Max Pacioretty grabbed J.T. Miller by the head and threw him down after the whistle for a roughing penalty. Tuch got a double minor for pummelling Jake Virtanen while the Vancouver forward lay on the ice.

Pacioretty scored late for Vegas and Tanner Pearson added the final Vancouver goal into an empty net.

Horvat had not found the scoresheet since scoring two goals in each of the first two games against the St. Louis Blues in the first round.

Pettersson has been a steady point-getter throughout the playoffs but had been shut down by Vegas in Game 1, limited to no shots on net and one blocked shot.

Markstrom, in his first playoff series, has been the locomotive pulling the Canucks' playoff train. He allowed just nine goals on 121 shots (.926 save percentage) against Minnesota in the first round while registering his first playoff shutout. He saved 29 of 34 against the Blues (.930).

The series is being played at a fan-less Rogers Place. Players are isolating between contests to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This was Williams’ fifth match since professional tennis resumed amid the coronavirus pandemic after a hiatus of nearly six months — and all five have gone three sets. She is 3-2 in that stretch.

The result against No. 13 seed Sakkari, and particularly the way the match ended, was hardly promising for Williams as the U.S. Open’s start approaches next week.

The Western & Southern Open is usually held in Ohio but was moved to the U.S. Open’s site in Flushing Meadows this year to make for a two-event, no-spectator ""bubble"" during the pandemic.

In men's play, Canada's Milos Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Andy Murray. Raonic, from Thornhill, Ont., is the last Canadian remaining in the draw.

Williams was seemingly in control early, serving for the first set at 5-3, 30-0, when things began to unravel. She missed two backhands in a row, then put a forehand into the net to set up a break point, and walked over to the stand holding her towel at the back of the court (the ball people normally handle towels for players, but not during COVID-19).

That’s when chair umpire Aurelie Tourte called a time violation. On the following point, Williams sailed a forehand long to get broken.

At the ensuing changeover, the 23-time Grand Slam champion argued with Tourte, saying: ""I mean, I’m getting my own towels. That’s not fair. You should tell me on the sidelines next time if I need to play faster. Believe me, I will. ... You didn't even give me a warning.""

While Williams eventually did grab that set, she again frittered away a 5-3 lead in the second, plus a 4-1 edge in the tiebreaker. When she sat after the second set, the 38-year-old American tossed her racket over her shoulder the way an office worker might flip a crumpled piece of paper toward a trash can.

Williams came out flat in the third set, as if she’d rather be anywhere else. She double-faulted four times in the second game, including on Sakkari’s eighth break chance, to make it 2-0 and that was pretty much that.

Hours earlier, Novak Djokovic’s neck felt much better, and his tennis looked much better, in a 6-2, 6-4 victory over unseeded American Tennys Sandgren that improved the No. 1-ranked man to 20-0 in 2020.

""Actually, I’m pleasantly surprised with the way I recovered and felt today — just overall, physically, but also with the neck, specifically, because that was a little bit of a concern,"" said Djokovic, who will be eyeing his 18th Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open. ""Going back four, five days, I did struggle quite a lot.""

Djokovic was treated by a trainer and played sluggishly in his opening match Monday, but he was at his best from the outset against Sandgren and saved all four break points he faced.

Djokovic will face 34th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff in the quarterfinals. The other quarterfinal in the top half of the draw will be defending champion Daniil Medvedev against No. 8 seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Reilly Opelka, a 6-foot-11 American who is ranked 39th, delivered 19 aces and knocked off 2019 U.S. Open semifinalist Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 7-6 (4). Opelka next meets No. 4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, whose 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4) win over No. 16 John Isner was interrupted by a rain delay of nearly 1 1/2 hours late in the first set.

Also interrupted by the weather was Raonic's victory over the three-time Grand Slam champion. Raonic, a Wimbledon runner-up in 2016, has held all 29 games he’s served so far in the tournament.

""I have done the work,"" Raonic said. ""I have put in the effort, and I'm just happy that this quickly the pieces are coming together.""

This was Murray's first tournament appearance since November. He missed time due to a pelvic injury and is playing on a metal hip after two operations on that joint.

""Didn’t play well. It was not a good day,"" Murray said. ""The positives are that I got three matches in. Physically, I pulled up OK.""

Women’s quarterfinal matchups set earlier in the day were two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka against Anett Kontaveit, former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka against Ons Jabeur, and 83rd-ranked American qualifier Jessica Pegula against No. 14 Elise Mertens.

He was 5 under after the front nine Tuesday at Ozarks National when he hit driver at the par-4 10th. The ball wound up in such heavy rough that Mickelson couldn't find it, forcing him to take a penalty stroke. He still wound up making a long putt to salvage bogey, and that gave him some momentum for the rest of the round.

""I was able to get right back to even par on the back side with a birdie on the next hole, and then I made a couple more coming in,"" said Mickelson, whose 7-under 64 left him 17 under.

That was good for a four-shot lead over Tim Petrovic and Rod Pampling, who will be his playing partners for the final round. Mike Weir of Bright's Grove, Ont., (69) was nine shots off the lead at 8 under.

""I've been putting really well,"" Mickelson said. ""Today I didn't drive it the way I've been driving it. I kind of a hung a few drives, so I'm going to the range and try to work on that now. But when I come out tomorrow I'll try to be a little bit more aggressive with the driver and see if I can make a few more birdies.""

A few more? He's already made 19 of them in his first 36 holes.

Playing in the final group and with the shadows getting long, Mickelson picked up right where he left off after his opening-round 61. He made birdie at the third and then rattled off three straight beginning at the par-4 fifth, where he nearly chipped in for eagle.

Petrovic tried to make a run at Mickelson, but even one of his career-low rounds only got him so close. His putter went cold down the stretch and a poor approach at the par-4 finishing hole resulted in bogey.

Mickelson added a bridie at the ninth, the only hole he bogeyed on Monday, after a pretty flop shot over the bunker. After the lost ball at the 10th, Mickelson responded by adding two more birdies.

The second of them at the par-3 12th was a backhanded tap-in. His approach shot barely carried onto the front edge of the green, then nestled up to about an inch from the hole.

Mickelson could still squander the lead in the final round Wednesday, when tee times were moved to the early morning because of expected bad weather in the afternoon. But given the quality of his short game through 36 holes, the more pressing question is whether he could break the PGA Tour Champions' 54-hole scoring record of 191 — shared by Bruce Fleisher, Loren Roberts, Bernhard Langer, David Frost and Rocco Mediate.

Mickelson, who decided to make his debut on the over-50 tour to continue his U.S. Open prep after he was eliminated from the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, would need to shoot 65 in his final round Wednesday to move atop the list.

Petrovic and Pampling each shot 64-65 over the first two rounds. Rocco Mediate struggled coming in and was at 12 under.

K.J. Choi was another shot back, and Steve Stricker and David McKenzie were at 10 under.

Moments later, the Chicago White Sox right-hander threw the final pitch in a truly bizarre performance.

article continues below

A no-fan no-no.

With the seats at Guaranteed Rate Field empty, Giolito pitched the first no-hitter of the pandemic-delayed season, striking out 13 in leading the White Sox over the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 Tuesday night.

""2020 has been a very strange year,"" said Giolito, who conducted a postgame interview while wearing a mask. ""Obviously a lot of weird stuff going on with COVID and the state of the world, so may as well throw this in the mix.""

Sounds like he didn't mind that nobody saw it. Well, almost no one.

After right fielder Adam Engel extended on the run to catch Erik Gonzalez’s slicing drive toward the line for the final out, the hollers of Giolito’s teammates in the middle of the diamond echoed around the stadium.

""I’m just stoked for Lucas and so happy and ecstatic and emotional for Lucas,"" Engel said. ""It stinks we couldn’t celebrate the way most no-hitters get celebrated.""

The smallest crowd listed for any no-hitter in the majors over the last 100 years came in 1944, when a mere 1,014 watched Cincinnati’s Clyde Shoun beat the Braves at Crosley Field.

Nowhere close to that number on this night, not with the park that holds over 40,000 closed to fans because of virus protocols.

Suffice to say, years from now when White Sox fans fondly remember Giolito’s gem, there will not be, say, 100,000 or so people claiming they were there to see it in person.

At one point early in the game, some members of grounds crew drifted in sight, but that was about it outside of the teams.

An All-Star last year, the 26-year-old Giolito (3-2) matched his career high for strikeouts set in his previous start against Detroit.

Only a four-pitch walk to Gonzalez leading off the fourth inning got in Giolito’s way of perfection. That was only runner he permitted while throwing 101 pitches

""I’ve been working for this type of game for a while now and it’s really cool that we got it done,"" Giolito said.

Giolito relied on his changeup and fastball to make quick work of the Pirates, who came into the game batting just .229 and have the worst record in the majors. Six of their starters finished the game hitting under .199 this season.

The White Sox rushed toward the mound after the final out in Giolito’s first career no-hitter. Giolito hugged catcher James McCann as the Chicago players joined the party.

The South Side of Chicago normally rattles with fireworks after a home win -- this is the club that gave the game the exploding scoreboard -- but the park remained silent as the dugout emptied.

Giolito, meanwhile, was locked in his own zone in the later innings, fully aware of what was at stake.

""After the seventh, six more outs, looking at who I was facing, became very, very, very possible,"" he said, ""and then we were able to get it done.""

Giolito said his approach never wavered.

""Just staying with the same, like, mental routine for every single pitch. One pitch at a time. Full focus, full execution, straight through the target,"" he said.

Giolito pitched the 19th no-hitter in White Sox history — second most to the Dodgers' 23 — and first since Philip Humber threw a perfect game at Seattle in 2012. This was the seventh time the Pirates have been held hitless, with Washington’s Max Scherzer having done it in 2015.

White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson made a nifty play on a grounder by Bryan Reynolds up the middle in the seventh to preserve the gem, helped by first baseman Jose Abreu’s stretch at the bag.

In the ninth, Gonzalez hit a liner that Engel, a fleet centre fielder for most of his career, caught on the run at knee-high height.

""Yeah man, I think I got it,"" Gonzalez said. ""With that at-bat, I was a little bit mad because I don’t want to be part of history.""

Giolito improved to 30-28 in his big league career. He made his debut with Washington in 2016, then was traded after that season to the White Sox in a package for outfielder Adam Eaton.

Giolito gave up a major league-high 118 earned runs in 2018, his first full season in Chicago.

""I was pretty much bottom of the league in almost every stat,"" Giolito said. ""I kind of had to ... learn from failure to learn my true potential.""

He added: ""I always envisioned that I’d throw a no-hitter in the big leagues.""

Giolito threw the first no-hitter at Guaranteed Rate Field since Minnesota’s Francisco Liriano did it in 2011.

The White Sox, who’ve won eight of their last nine, ended the Pirates’ season-best winning streak at three games.

Giolito was dominant in his previous start, too, fanning 13 against Detroit and allowing just three hits in seven innings. The victory over Pittsburgh was his third career shutout.

Chicago’s first three batters reached in the second and all three came home one at a time after Engel’s groundout and singles Anderson and Eloy Jimenez. McCann added a sacrifice fly in the third off Steven Brault (0-1).

TRAINER’S ROOM

Pirates: RH reliever Keone Kela was available to pitch after leaving Friday’s loss to Milwaukee with forearm tightness. … Infielders Colin Moran (collision) and Kevin Newman (abdomen) also were on the bench after leaving Sunday’s game.

White Sox: McCann stayed in the game after being struck near his left hand by a second-inning pitch from Brault. ... Jimenez appeared to be getting treatment near the mound after the celebration, but manager Rick Renteria said he walked off under his own power.

UP NEXT

LHP Dallas Keuchel (4-2, 2.65) looks for his third straight win Wednesday afternoon against Pirates RHP Trevor Williams (1-4, 3.70).

His team gave up a goal he felt shouldn't have counted three minutes into the opening period and had a subsequent equalizer called back on a razor-thin offside challenge.

Down 1-0 in the series and playing well, Tampa Bay then grabbed its first lead in more than 110 minutes of action midway through the third period only to see Boston tie it up with under four minutes to go in regulation.

""Adversity strikes in the weirdest ways,"" Cooper said. ""You never know when it's going to happen.

""Sometimes you're just dealt ... a sandwich that doesn't taste very good, if you know what I mean.""

And deal with it they did.

Ondrej Palat scored at 4:40 of overtime as the Lightning defeated the Bruins 4-3 to even their second-round playoff series 1-1.

Blake Coleman added two goals in regulation for the Lightning, while Nikita Kucherov had the other. Andrei Vasilevskiy made 22 saves to get the win.

""If there was one message that was going on it was we liked everything that was going on about the game,"" Cooper said. ""I know it sounds so cliche, but we just had to stick with it. Some teams, if you have mental weakness at all, you're probably sitting there saying, 'Poor us.'

""But it's just not been this group. That's not how they operate.""

Brad Marchand buried his second of the night to tie things with under four minutes left in the third period for the Bruins, while Nick Ritchie also scored. David Pastrnak added two assists for Boston, which got 36 stops from Jaroslav Halak.

The teams don't have much time to digest the result, with Game 3 of the best-of-seven matchup set for Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET back inside the fan-less Scotiabank Arena.

Tampa, which beat the Columbus Blue Jackets in quintuple overtime of Game 1 in the opening round before closing out the series in the extra period of Game 5 on a pair of goals from Brayden Point, got the winner after Boston couldn't clear its zone.

Patrick Maroon tried a wraparound that Halak stopped, but Palat was there to bury the rebound to score his first of the post-season and send the Lightning pouring off their bench in celebration.

""It's obviously big-time frustrating any time you lose a game and especially in that fashion,"" Bruins centre Sean Kuraly said. ""We thought we were trending in the right direction, (thinking) momentum may be swinging our way. You get the puck close to the blue line a couple times and you don't get it out, and against a good team that's what happens.

""It ends up in the back of your net.""

Acquired prior to February's trade deadline from the New Jersey Devils, Coleman gave Tampa its first lead of the series at 10:40 of the third after taking a stretch pass from Victor Hedman. The Lightning centre moved in alone on Halak and snuck an off-speed shot through the five-hole after getting slashed by Bruins defenceman Connor Clifton.

Boston, however, responded with 3:58 left in regulation when Marchand finished off a pretty passing play. With the Bruins in the middle of a change — Patrice Bergeron would normally be on the ice — Kuraly took a feed from Pastrnak and quickly found Marchand to bury his sixth and knot things up.

The Bruins, who triumphed 3-2 in Game 1 on the back of Halak's 35-save performance, took a 2-1 lead with 5:27 left in the second on a power play when Pastrnak faked a one-timer before sliding a pass to Marchand at the side of the net.

Tampa responded 56 seconds later after some great work from Point. The diminutive centre twisted and turned in the Bruins zone before finding Kevin Shattenkirk, whose shot was tipped in by Kucherov for his third.

The Lightning dressed seven defencemen with Ryan McDonagh (undisclosed), who has averaged a team-high 26:07 of ice time in the post-season, out injured after leaving midway through the third period of Game 1. Veteran blue-liners Luke Schenn and Braydon Coburn drew in, while Carter Verhaeghe was scratched up front.

Boston owned the best record in the NHL when the league suspended its season because of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, but dropped to the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference after losing all three of its games in the round-robin portion of the restart.

The Bruins found their groove in the first round of the usual 16-team playoff bracket, disposing of the Carolina Hurricanes in five games.

Tampa, meanwhile, had the second-best mark in the East and was fourth overall when the schedule was halted. The Lightning finished second in the round-robin and then downed Columbus.

The Bruins jumped out to a 1-0 lead at 3:14 of Tuesday's first period after Tampa defenceman Zach Bogosian's stick disintegrated at the offensive blue line. Boston broke the other way, with Ritchie stuffing his first past Vasilevskiy, who thought he had the puck covered — much to Cooper's chagrin.

The Lightning responded a couple minutes later when Barclay Goodrow tipped Coburn's point shot up and over Halak. The Bruins, however, correctly challenged for offside after Point was a fraction of a second too slow exiting the Boston zone on the tag up.

Cooper fired a number of expletives at the officials when the call was reversed, but was back smiling on the bench after a surprising burst from an unlikely source eventually knotted the score.

Bogosian, a bruising blue-liner known mostly for his physical play, split two Boston defenders, and as he was getting knocked down fed a diving Coleman, who slid his second past Halak before crashing into the net at 12:42.

""I saw Bogo picking up some speed,"" Coleman said. ""He just kind of had that look in his eye like he was about to do something. I just made it a point to get up into play with him, try to give him an option.

""He made a heck of a play.""

It was also the first sign the Lightning weren't going to be fazed by that early adversity.

""Any time there's a mishap, you just turn the page,"" Cooper said of his roster. ""It was needed tonight, I'll tell you that, because they need to be rewarded for the work they were doing.

""And in the end, they were.""

The All-Star guard scored 35 points and the Los Angeles Clippers rolled past the Dallas Mavericks 154-111 on Tuesday night to take a 3-2 lead in their first-round Western Conference playoff series.

George had shot 29% in the series and endured fans' wrath on social media. He said he spoke to the team psychiatrist before Game 5.

""I mean, whatever it was, the bubble got the best of me,"" George said. ""I was just in a dark place. I really wasn’t here. I checked out. The past couple of games, it was just difficult.""

George said it didn't feel like the playoffs until his teammates decided to create the atmosphere that was lacking inside the NBA's Walt Disney World bubble.

""I came in with that mindset that this is Staples, we’re at home,"" he said. ""The place is packed. I really had to psych myself up. I thought the whole team took that and we ran with it. We created our own energy. We decided to dictate this game.""

Kawhi Leonard scored 32 points and Montrezl Harrell added 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers, who set a franchise record for points in a playoff game. Los Angeles can clinch the series on Thursday.

Dallas' Luka Doncic, who hit a game-winner at the buzzer in Game 4 to cap off a 43-point triple-double, was held to 22 points on 6-for-17 shooting.

Dallas coach Rick Carlisle was ejected in the third quarter of the testy game, which included six technicals and a flagrant-1 foul.

Doncic said Clippers forward Marcus Morris might have stepped on his ankle intentionally early in the third quarter.

""I don’t want to talk to him,"" Doncic said. ""He’s just saying a lot of bad stuff to me all the game. I don’t want to talk to him. I’ve just got to move on. Like I said, everybody’s going to have their own opinion. I just hope it wasn’t intentional. If that was intentional, that’s very bad.""

Mavericks centre Kristaps Porzingis sat out with right knee soreness. It was the second straight game the 7-foot-3 Latvian missed.

Leonard scored 22 points and Paul George scored 18 to help Los Angeles take a 76-52 lead at halftime. The Clippers shot 61% in the first half and led by as many as 27 points.

The Clippers continued the onslaught in the second half, bumping the lead to as many as 45 points.

""Tough game,"" Carlisle said. ""Very poor performance by us. It was disappointing. It was very physical. We just need to have a stronger physical disposition to start the game and throughout. We’ve got to get some more traction at both ends of the floor.""

TIP-INS

Mavericks: Doncic was issued a technical foul in the second quarter. ... G Tim Hardaway Jr. was called for a flagrant-1 after winding up and hitting George in the face on a drive. ... Assistant Stephen Silas took over as coach after Carlisle was ejected.

Clippers: Shot 67% from the field in the first quarter. ... Hardaway and Morris were called for double technicals in the second quarter. C Ivica Zubac was called for a technical in the third.

BIGGER THAN BASKETBALL

Clippers coach Doc Rivers was emotional while discussing the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which has sparked national outrage and some violent protests. Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back while his three children watched.

""That video, if you watch that video — you don’t need to be Black to be outraged,"" Rivers said. ""You need to be American and outraged. How dare the Republicans talk about fear. We’re the ones that need to be scared. We’re the ones having to talk to every Black child. What white father has to give his son a talk about being careful if you get pulled over? It’s just ridiculous. It keeps going. There’s no charges. Breonna Taylor — no charges. Nothing. All we’re asking is you live up to the Constitution. That’s all we’re asking -- for everybody. For everyone.""

CARLISLE'S EJECTION

Carlisle described what led to his ejection. Hardaway had the ball at the free-throw line, and then Rivers was granted a timeout.

""My understanding in that situation is that once a shooter has the ball, a timeout cannot be called by the opposing coach,"" Carlisle said. ""I thought the call was wrong. So I was asking about it and wasn’t getting a great explanation and then it turned into a technical and then another technical. I’m just standing up for my team.""

""The good news is that the housing market is contributing to the recovery in economic activity.""","TORONTO — Canada's housing market shattered records in July despite the economic uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic — and with the usually busy fall real estate season drawing near, experts are divided about whether the boom will continue.

Last month marked the highest monthly sales figure on record, the Canadian Real Estate Association reported, while the national average sales price jumped to a record $571,500.

Part of the fuel behind rising prices has been driven by a change in the real estate cycle, RBC senior economist Robert Hogue said during an RBC podcast earlier this month.

Traditionally, many homebuyers and sellers wait until spring to make deals as snowfall hampers curb appeal. This year, all of the usual spring homebuying fever was pushed into the usually slow summer months as people emerged from lockdown.

Under normal circumstances, real estate agents expect a busy period in early fall as people try to finish their move before winter.

Rachel Gagnon, an Ottawa-based real estate broker at Ian Charlebois & Associates Real Estate & Mortgages, said the demand for housing has stemmed from ""stay at home"" orders, which left people wishing for more space and amenities.

""Unless a major, and I mean very major, shift was to happen, which would create an influx of properties on the market, things will continue to move as they have over the last few months,"" she said.

""As we move forward through August and September, people work through the new school rules, I think we'll see a fairly large uptick in activity. Unless a second wave shifts things dramatically, I think we're going to have a very busy fall market that won't slow down until the Christmas season.""

But Gagnon also said that she has seen the pressure placed on first-time homebuyers, who are trying to get into the market now while they can afford a mortgage, even if it maxes out their borrowing power.

And COVID-19 related travel restrictions have led to slowing immigration and less demand from property buyers seeking rental properties for tourists or students.

The uncertainty means a fall slowdown is possible, said Bethany King, a team leader at Century 21 Millennium Inc. Brokerage in Brampton, Ont.

While some lenders are offering cash back, lending expectations have also changed, said King. For example, some lenders consider essential workers to have better job security should a second COVID-19 wave come.

Fear about a ""second wave"" in the fall has parents planning to save money, in case children are sent home and parents need to cut back hours and income to focus on caregiving, she said.

""Those are the things that have investors who are regular people — not millionaires that have tons and tons of properties, and are cashing out — preparing for the worst,"" King said.

Kean Birch, an associate professor at York University, said he will be watching for the extension or end of mortgage payment deferrals.

""I find it worrying that housing prices are continuing to rise. The reason being that we don't know what's going to happen once the mortgage payment deferral ends, and the consequences actually could be dramatic across the board. And it could be highly inequitable as well,"" said Birch, who studies economic geography.

Evan Siddall, chief executive of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., wrote a letter earlier this month that said he expects house prices to fall, ""even in the face of recent activity, which appears to be the result of very low interest rates and a sharp reduction in new listings.""

""Our projections always anticipated a delayed impact: weakening in late 2020 and 2021 once government income supports unwind,"" read the letter.

However, Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centres, called CMHC's forecast is ""overly pessimistic.""

""Here we are in the second half of 2020, and the national average sales price has risen 14.3 per cent year-over-year,"" she said.

""The good news is that the housing market is contributing to the recovery in economic activity.""

The latest price list from research firm Random Lengths released Thursday shows SPF (spruce, pine, fir) two-by-four boards at a ""mindboggling"" record level of US$760 per thousand board feet, up $82 on the week, according to Kevin Mason, managing director of ERA Forest Products Research.

""You've got buyers who care more about just getting product than they do about the price,"" he said in an interview.

""The companies have purchase orders sitting on the desk and it's, like, when you get product, send it to us, and just tell us what we owe you. Buyers don't care. Right now, it's an absolute panic, a scramble to get product.""

The run-up over the past several weeks has demolished the previous North American record high of US$650 set in mid-2018, he said, adding prices for other building products are rising just as quickly.

Homebuilders say increases this year to date will translate into $8,000 to $10,000 more to build a typical single-family house in Canada.

Jayman Built Homes will have to consider passing on its higher costs to customers when lumber supply contracts expire at the end of August, said president and chief operating officer Dave Desormeaux.

""Most builders, I believe, would just pass it on and increase the price of a home for the cost of the materials,"" he said, adding his firm, which plans to build about 700 homes this year in Edmonton and Calgary, has the capacity to absorb short-term commodity fluctuations.

""Right now we're not affected but, come Sept. 1, when we're building houses, it's going to be a huge increase for us because we've eaten it (higher prices) along the way.""

But Bobby Richardson, whose Woodlands Mountain Homes builds five or so custom homes per year in Bow River Valley communities west of Calgary, says he has no choice but to pass his higher costs on to current customers.

The rise in demand comes from increased interest in renovations by people working from home during the pandemic, said Mason, along with a strong housing market in Canada and the U.S. fuelled by people's renewed appreciation of having their own homes and aided by extremely low interest rates.

Supply, meanwhile, has fallen as several mills in British Columbia were closed over the past year due to a shortage of wood fibre after a mountain pine beetle infestation and recent wildfires. Those mills aren't likely to reopen soon, he said.

Many North American mills curtailed production temporarily earlier this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

Lumber production was about 1.6 billion board feet lower in April and May compared to the same months in 2019, said analyst Paul Quinn of RBC Dominion Securities in a report. That's equivalent to removing about 4.5 per cent of total 2019 production in North America.

""We expect that actual demand was higher than production in both April and May due to strong R&R (renovation) demand, which resulted in distributors drawing down inventory levels,"" he said, adding the tight market could persist even though most curtailed mills have returned to production by the end of June.

""With new residential construction returning with a vengeance in June-July, we expect that even normal supplies would be wholly inadequate to meet demand.""

Canadian lumber production declined by 18.9 per cent in May, he said, with B.C. production down 26.2 per cent year-over-year to 677 million board feet. In the U.S., production fell by 6.8 per cent.

In a research report, CIBC analysts point out that current lumber prices are just two per cent less than the all-time peak in November 1996 when the price for two-by-fours hit US$480 (or US$775 in today's dollars after adjusting for inflation).

Canadian lumber producers coming off better-than-expected second quarter financial reports are making gains on the commodity price rally as investors flock to snap up their shares.

On Friday, West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd., Interfor Corp. and Canfor Corp. all rose to new 52-week high stock prices on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

About 353,000 square feet of buildings are envisioned, Peter Laughlin, Omicron’s director of development on Vancouver Island, said Thursday.

The proposal covers four development parcels. Omicron and Lotus will own two and Omicron will be the development manager of the other two.

Applications have been submitted for employment centre zoning on two of the parcels to attract businesses, add services and provide local jobs, which would help address local transportation issues, Laughlin said. The West Shore is known for its slow traffic during rush hours.

“One of the things that we were looking at, and we knew from past experience - there was a need for industrial lands. The Island is growing. We have an extremely solid economy here. The economy needs support. So we were looking for industrial land for quite a while,” Laughlin said.

The Allandale District is located on both sides of Veterans Memorial Parkway and along Allandale Road.

Colwood Mayor Rob Martin said the community has called for more commercial and light industrialdevelopment.

These kinds of uses will broaden the tax base, he said, adding that, as a bedroom community, Colwood has been relying on residential taxpayers to cover most of the municipality’s bills.

To have tax revenue from commercial uses is “huge for us,” Martin said.

Colwood is passionate about adding well-paying new jobs, held by people who live in the community, Martin said.

“In a very small way, it begins to address the issues around transportation as well. One of our solutions to this is that we need to begin to create more jobs here in the West Shore.”

He welcomes projects which will redevelop existing brownfield sites in Colwood, as in this case.

Half of the development lands are on an old gravel pit and the remainder on a rock bluff, Laughlin said.

Rocks were blasted out of the bluff to create flat areas for development. More than 200,000 cubic metres of blasted rock was relocated to become infill on the former gravel pit, making the entire area usable, Laughlin said. “Land that was seven-eight-nine metres below the road level is now at road level and usable. So it’s a good example of brownfield development.”

Ridley Bros. has been the owner of the four parcels, Laughlin said.

Rezoning applications for two lots, one immediately to the west of the Parkway (Lot B) and another to the east (Lot C) and north of Allandale Road, have been submitted to pave the way for mixed-use employment centres. The applications are expected to come up on the city’s Aug. 24 agenda.

Omicron and Lotus Capital will own the southern and most westerly lot, Lot A, as well as Lot C, north of Allandale and east of the Parkway.

Lot A already allows a range of industrial uses. Colliers International is carrying out market research on what would be the best use for Lot C.

Lot B, immediately to the west of the Parkway, will be owned by local company Sherringham Holdings Ltd.

“The plan right now is for approximately 100,000 square feet of development on that site,” Laughlin said. Of that, about 60,000 square feet will be built as mini-storage, with 40,000 used for commercial-retail.

“The interesting innovation that Sherringham is bringing to the mini-storage market is it is a multi-floor mini-storage,” Laughlin said.

Plans call for a four-storey building, serviced by industrial elevators.

The fourth parcel, Lot 3, east of the parkway and south of Allandale, will be developed on behalf of the Carson Auto Group for a new Ford dealership, Laughlin said.

Mortgage rates have been falling in recent weeks.

While most borrowers do not pay anything close to the benchmark posted rate for a mortgage, the rate is used when assessing borrowers as part of a financial stress test.

The check is meant to ensure homebuyers will be able to make their mortgage payments in the future if rates increase from the where they are today. The drop in the benchmark rate makes the test is easier.

According to Ratehub.ca's mortgage affordability calculator, a family with an annual income of $100,000, a 10 per cent down payment and five-year fixed mortgage rate would have qualified for a home valued at $523,410 under the 4.94 per cent qualifying rate. Under the new rate, they can now afford $531,230.

Laird said the rate drop was hardly a surprise because when underlying rates have been dropping, eventually posted rates catch up.

Though the decrease will help many, he categorized it as ""not a major change.""

""Anyone was qualifying for a mortgage no problem, they are unaffected,"" he said.

""Anyone who was not close to qualifying, they are also not affected.""

Because it takes time to correct a credit score error, waiting until you ""need"" your high credit score is a risky move, she says.
So I would encourage people to check their credit report and make sure that everything on there looks right.""","TORONTO — Hundreds of thousands of Canadians have been negotiating with lenders over the past few months, hoping to hold off paying debt amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Now, those payments are beginning to filter through the credit reporting system.

article continues below

""We have seen the average number of accounts that are in a payment deferral status triple since before the pandemic,"" says Eva Wong, co-founder and chief operating officer of Borrowell, which offers free credit scores and reports.

""It shouldn't impact the credit score, but it should show up on the credit report.""

The Canadian Bankers Association said that as of June 30, 760,000 account holders had negotiated mortgage deferrals or skipped payments, while 445,000 had requested deferral for credit card debt.

According to Equifax, deferred payments — many agreed to as part of COVID-19 relief programs — don't harm borrowers' credit scores. But the payments must be reported in a certain way, and the status of these payments may not get reported to Equifax for up to 30 days.

It's important to make sure these deferred payments are reported correctly to credit bureaus, because even one false late payment can drop a credit score by as much as 150 points, says Wong. Credit scores are used not only by lenders, but also checked by cellphone carriers, employers and landlords, Wong says. Because it takes time to correct a credit score error, waiting until you ""need"" your high credit score is a risky move, she says.

""Depending on the type of error, the longer it persists, the more negative the impact,"" says Wong. ""If it's showing up as a late payment and it goes to month two, then it's two months of missed payments as opposed to just one. So I would encourage people to check their credit report and make sure that everything on there looks right.""

Anne Arbour, a financial educator at the Credit Counselling Society in Toronto, says that Canada's two credit-reporting agencies, Equifax Canada and TransUnion Canada, are data aggregators, and it is up to the lenders to create policies on how they report the deferred payments. It's important for consumers to get clear documentation of their agreement with their lender — such as a bank — when it comes to how they are reporting deferred payments, she says.

""Get as much detail from the lender, from the creditor, as possible about what a deferral will mean and what their practices as far as reporting it — so, whether it will impact somebody's rating or their score or not,"" says Arbour. ""And if there is any issue or concern, deal with the creditor first, getting as much written information as possible.""

Arbour noted that deferrals are not an automatic license to skip payments — not only must a formal agreement be struck, but many lenders may have explicit instructions on how interest or even late fees accrues while payments are halted.

Taylor Little, chief of Vancouver-based alternative lender, Neighbourhood Holdings, says that many people skipped payments based on reading about deferral programs, without actually checking to make sure whether the lender was offering deferrals or some other type of payment plan instead. Doing that can hurt a credit score, and likely won't be counted as an error, he says.

When checking with lenders, Arbour says people should collect a copy of the agreement, a file ID or reference number, and the name of the agent with whom they spoke, in case this information is needed to file a credit score dispute down the road.

If a consumer notices something that might be wrong on their credit score —such as a deferred payment being counted as ""late"" — the lender is once again the first stop, she says.

""Going back to the creditor themselves is a good first step,"" she says. ""[Equifax and TransUnion] have worked closely with the Canadian Bankers Association, with the lenders, everybody to try and come up with a way to report any deferrals, whether it was mortgages or credit cards, in a way that wouldn't penalize the consumer. But the onus ultimately was on and is on the creditors to change their systems.""

In addition to requesting a fix from the lender, consumers can ask Equifax or TransUnion to investigate a mismarked payment, through a credit report update form or investigation request form. Separately, consumers can also now put a ""consumer statement"" to a credit report to signal to lenders that something is being disputed. Equifax Canada gives an example: ""Be advised that the negative accounts on my credit report are related to the Covid-19 pandemic. I intend to make these up as soon as I can find a job.""

Keeping on top of errors — and being quick to correct them if they happen — is easier if consumers stick with a routine and understand the parts of the credit scoring process, says Arbour. For example, free services that offer credit monitoring offer more frequent updates and are different from Equifax or TransUnion's free yearly reports. Those annual reports from Equifax or TransUnion are also different from the formal scores checked by lenders in a ""hard"" credit check, she says.

She advised that consumers can take advantage of both credit monitoring services and free yearly reports.

""There's no sort of one size fits all answer — very often mortgages don't actually appear on credit reports,"" says Arbour. ""[Mismarked deferrals] haven't been brought up as a concern just yet. . . . I think come September, it might be a different story. Once deferrals are over, unless people are checking their credit report, they won't notice it unless they're in a situation where they're having to renew their term or renegotiate a rate or a debt management program.""

The report suggests the vacancy rate will remain fairly stable for the rest of this year, likely getting to 6.3 or 6.5 per cent by the end of the year.

That’s largely due to two provincial ministries moving lock, stock and stapler to the Capital Park development in James Bay, according to Colliers vice president Tristan Spark, who noted 80 per cent of the 70,000 square feet of newly available office space downtown resulted from the moves.

Spark said new projects, like the $250 million mixed-used Capital Park development, offer new Class A office space and spur on a flight to quality, which tends to leave older Class B and C buildings vacant or available at lower rents to other businesses or ripe for redevelopment.

The report suggests the vacancy rate will remain fairly stable for the rest of this year, likely getting to 6.3 or 6.5 per cent by the end of the year.

Spark said it could climb to about seven per cent at some point before things normalize, but he points out even at that point the city will be in good shape as its 10-year average occupancy is about eight per cent.

The reason the vacancy rate is expected to remain stable, according to Spark, is the success the province has had in dealing with the pandemic.

“It didn’t really affect offices too much,” he said.

It did result in many government offices and Crown agencies directing their staff to work from home for the foreseeable future, while high-tech firms and other companies that could did the same.

The move to work remotely drastically changed the traffic pattern and sheer number of people on the street in the downtown core, but it didn’t translate into much office vacancy.

Spark said that’s down to companies and government still needing space for employees who can’t or don’t feel comfortable working from home.

“There will always be a need for office space,” he said, noting it may be fine for people working at home now, but that is bound to change in the winter or after the novelty wears off after a year or two. “I don’t think the office is going anywhere.”

He said from what he’s seen government is sticking with more or less the same footprint, but having fewer people in each floor plate to allow for social distancing.

Some companies that had expanded are now considering sub-leasing their extra space and maintaining their current size.

“Over the last 10 years the trend has been to have open concepts and increased employee density. That’s over,” said Spark, adding there will now be more options on the table including working from home for employees. “There will be a return now to traditional offices and more private offices.”

According to the province, which occupies a massive footprint in the downtown, public service workplaces are expected to continue operating with reduced occupancy capacity to allow for social distancing.

Ministries will continue to find a balance of in-office and remote work, and will support employees who choose to work from home where the nature of their work allows for it.

At the same time, some offices have been expanded and reconfigured to allow more workers to return to the ministry buildings while having space for social distancing.

The Colliers report points out there is still plenty of space on the way to market, with 204,000 square feet of office space currently under construction and another 419,000 square feet in various planning stages, like the massive Telus-Ocean building planned for the Apex lot downtown.

Spark said as those developments come to the market, the new space is likely to be snapped up and the older space taken over by the burgeoning tech sector or other businesses and in some cases bought by developers to add more residential units.

“Historically that’s what happens,” he said.

In the short- and medium-term, however, the retail space is expected to feel the squeeze in the downtown especially.

Spark said retail has certainly taken more hits than office space so far, and he’s had some clients opt to downsize their current locations to find more affordable retail space downtown.

A total of 1,930 starts have been recorded for the capital region for the first seven months, up only slightly from 1,921 Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said Tuesday in its monthly report on housing starts.

What’s notable is that these homes are going ahead as Greater Victoria’s housing market remains strong, even as unemployment last month reached 11.1 per cent — the third consecutive monthly increase.

The capital region has seen single-family housing starts increase as developers focus on major projects in the West Shore, such as Latoria North and South on Royal Bay lands in Colwood.

Smaller lots, low interest rates and lower land costs are among factors luring builders to the West Shore.

Year-to-date, single-family house construction rose by 20 per cent, with 420 starts, an increase from 349 for the same months last year.

Last month alone, the number of homes started in Greater Victoria was 363, up from 307 in July 2019. The majority — 321 — were in Langford, Colwood, View Royal and Sooke.

Of the single-family homes that got underway this year, 273 of them have been in Langford, Colwood, View Royal and Sooke, with 51 in July alone.

Across Canada, a total of 245,604 starts were recorded in July, an increase of 16 per cent from 212,095 in June.

“The national trend in housing starts increased for a second month in July,” said Bob Dugan, CMHC’s chief economist.

“Higher multi-family starts in major urban areas, including Toronto, Vancouver and oil-producing centres in the Prairies drove the national increase.

“Following declines in previous months from COVID-19 measures, higher activity in June and July leaves the trend in housing starts in line with the long-run average level of housing starts.”

Dugan predicted that national starts will trend lower in the near term because of the negative impact of COVID-19 the economy.

Omar Abdelrahman, TD Banking economist, said, “Canadian housing data continues to defy expectations.”

The latest numbers “reinforces the resilience of homebuilding activity, and housing market activity more broadly, despite the unprecedented, pandemic-induced hit to the economy.”

Other than a pandemic-related shutdown in Quebec in April,“homebuilding has shown only a muted response to COVID-19, swiftly returning to pre-pandemic levels. This stands in contrast with more severe declines and more drawn-out recoveries seen in other industries,” Abdelrahman said.

Housing demand now and in the near term will be partly fuelled by past population growth, low interest rates, and general demand, he said.

However, he cautions that lower immigration limiting population growth could reduct that activity.

Economists on average had expected an annual rate of 210,000, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.

""Housing starts continue to rebound nicely. Strong underlying demand and low rates mean builders likely won't be packing away those hammers any time soon,"" wrote Priscilla Thiagamoorthy, an economist at BMO Capital Markets Economics, in a note to clients.

The increase came as urban starts of apartments, condos and other types of multiple-unit housing projects rose 18.8 per cent to 184,431 in July while single-detached urban starts climbed 12.3 per cent to 47,564.

Rural starts were estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 13,609 units for July.

""The strength in homebuilding was widespread across all regions, but was, surprisingly, led by the Prairies and Atlantic Canada,"" wrote Omar Abdelrahman, an economist at TD Economics. ""Indeed, aside from the complete pause in Quebec in April due to restrictions on non-essential economic activity, homebuilding has shown only a muted response to COVID-19, swiftly returning to pre-pandemic levels.""

Despite the upward trend, Bob Dugan, CMHC's chief economist, said in a statement that he expects homebuilding to slow in the near future. Dugan's statement cited the negative impact of COVID-19 on economic and housing indicators.

""Despite the housing market's durability thus far, we continue to see a soft spot ahead given the ongoing lack of immigration and upcoming resumption of many deferred mortgages,"" wrote Royce Mendes in a note to clients from CIBC Economics.

""Furthermore, interest from investors for short-term rental condo units in downtown cores has come under severe pressure just as demand dynamics are shifting toward a desire for suburban homes with more space and backyards.""

GMC Projects has the green light from Victoria city council to build a five-storey commercial and rental apartment block in Fairfield and will name it after Alick Thomas Bentall Charlesworth, who died May 30, 1917, while flying a DH4 bomber over the battlefields of France.

The Charlesworth building will feature a large mural on an exterior wall of the young corporal, the bomber he flew and the 88th Battalion in which he served. It is being built adjacent to another GMC project, the refurbished Bell Apartments, where Charlesworth and his new bride lived before he left for war.

Charlesworth was 23 when he was killed. He had been married just a year and a half earlier to Elizabeth Rosina May Price on Salt Spring Island.

“It became apparent to us that it would be fitting to acknowledge someone’s sacrifice,” said GMC chief executive Jordan Milne. “It’s a great opportunity to tell his story through mural art.”

An older 21Ú2-storey home at 1015 Cook Street will be dismantled and many of the materials such as doors and stained-glass windows will be salvaged and used in the Charlesworth, a 7,200-square-foot building which will have 28 market rental units and three live/work spaces at the ground level.

The Charlesworth will be set back from the Bell Apartments so a mural on that building of Lady Bell — which pays homage to the suffragette movement — can be seen by people walking or driving along Cook Street between Meares Street and Rockland Avenue. Plaques on the histories of both buildings will be installed for passersby, said Milne.

Lydia Beauregard, who painted the Lady Bell mural, has also been commissioned to do the mural on the Charlesworth.

Construction is expected to start in January and take about 18 months, said Milne.

Milne said initial concept plans from Beauregard won’t only incorporate images of Charlesworth, his bomber and battalion, but also some “whimsical elements” of the period around the turn of the last century.

The 106-year-old Bell Apartments building was damaged by a fire in February 2017. GMC bought the building in 2018 and completed most of the renovations in 2019. Some finishing touches still remain, said Milne. Building permits have been submitted to the city by GMC to convert an old warehouse in the back of the Bell into two townhouse units.

The Charlesworth will also feature a rooftop space with an outdoor kitchen with two gas barbecues, an eat-in bar, formal dining space, artificial turf games space, a chaise lounge and sectional seating areas.

Milne said the space is designed to increase social interaction and will be shared with residents of the Bell Apartments.

“It is basically going to be a game-changer for south Nanaimo,” Ian Porter, Seacliff Properties’ director of development, said Wednesday.

Seacliff intends to build Sandstone over 20 years. Investment “will easily be in the billions,” Porter said.

“It’s going to create employment opportunities on the south side of Nanaimo that are not there not there now. It is going to create shopping opportunities.

Sandstone is at the junction of the Trans-Canada and Duke Point highways.

When Seacliff bought the land in 2018, it came with a previous blueprint for a planned community.

The new version includes a business park expected to generate 5,500 permanent jobs once the project is complete.

Seacliff’s other Vancouver Island properties include Royal Beach land in Colwood, where it plans a mixed-use development, and the Fairwinds golf and residential community at Nanoose Bay.

“We fully believe that Vancouver Island is going to continue to grow,” Porter said. “More people are going to live there. More people are going to want to do business there.”

Nanaimo city hall is reviewing Seacliff’s application for its updated plan and zoning amendments. “Staff are targeting the autumn for council introduction of the amendment bylaws,” said city planner Brian Zurek.

Sandstone would be developed in four precincts: a business park-employment zone, an urban town centre and expansion of two existing neighbourhoods, Chase River and Cinnabar.

If approved this fall, work could start on some residential and the business park in 2021, Porter said.

Seacliff estimates that construction would create more than 1,200 jobs per year.

Property taxes would total $17.67 million annually once the project is completed, with development cost charges adding up to $51.9 million for the project’s lifetime total, Seacliff’s submission states.

Sandstone could eventually have up to 3,200 homes in a range of single-family, duplexes, townhouses and apartment style homes. Some would be rental. Smaller lots and suites would contribute to affordability, the submission said. The developer is proposing a formula to contribute to the city’s affordable housing fund.

The town centre would have 2,000 residential units, some in towers, which could be up to 20 storeys. The town centre would include 550,000 square feet of commercial, offices and service uses.

In the Cinnabar neighbourhood, plans call for up to 600 detached homes and attached/townhouses, with space for a future elementary school.

The Chase River (Cedar Road) area would allow for up to 600 lower-density homes, and for a 100-acre reserve of riverfront land.

About half the lands in the Chase Valley and Cinnabar neighbourhoods would be allocated for parks, open space, and trails.

In the business-employment area, a maximum six million square feet could be constructed.

Mike Parker, Chase River Community Association chairperson said, “Generally I think there is a lot of support for the project from residents and from the association as a whole. It has been an ongoing process with numerous players saying they are going to develop that section of land over 30 years.

“It finally looks like somebody is going to come through and actually start developing it.”

The population is booming in the south end of Nanaimo and residents are eager for more services, Parker said. “We need more retail … we need jobs, we need affordable housing, we need rental units — all that stuff.”

Sandstone has taken into account much of what residents are seeking, Parker said. He is pleased with the proposed amount of green space.

A major existing concern for area residents is heavy traffic, especially along Extension Road and additional development could add to that, he said.

Nanaimo Mayor Leonard Krog said the project offers an opportunity for the community to get together, in conjunction with B.C. Transportation Ministry, to work out long-term solutions around traffic and active transportation.

Krog welcomed the business area portion of the project, saying “Nanaimo is very short on industrial land of any kind.”

Sandstone could bring major changes to the city’s southern area, he said. “It is also has potential to provide amenities that we might not otherwise see there for a number of years.”

Not all development proposals come to fruition, Krog noted, but in this case, “a substantial developer with deep pockets is working with the community to try and create a development that will hopefully have strong community support, particularly that part of town.”

Colliers noted that the “thin levels of transactions” in the second quarter totalled $200 million with the sale of 12 properties across the country. This compares with 36 sales and a total dollar volume of $666 million in the second quarter of 2019.

Four of the transactions were hotels in Vancouver and Victoria, bought by B.C. Housing to temporarily shelter homeless people. The province paid a total of $107 million.

B.C. Housing was also responsible for the single largest deal this year, with its purchase of the 110-room Howard Johnson hotel on Granville Street for $55 million, a price that pencils to about $500,000 per room.

At the start of the third quarter, B.C. Housing also purchased the American Hotel on Main Street, Vancouver, for $17.9 million.

For the first half of this year, hotel sales volumes in Canada totalled $500 million, down from $830 million in the first six months of 2019.

The hotel industry is suffering from pandemic-related travel restrictions that has seen international overnight visitors plunge 92 per cent in the second quarter compared to a year earlier.

All conferences booked into hotels have been cancelled or gone online since the pandemic began.

Nationally, the revenue per available room in Canadian hotels, a key industry metric, is down 54.9 per cent this year compared to 2019, Colliers reports.

Hotel occupancy fell to a record low of 12 per cent in April before recovering to an average of 28.9 per cent in early July, still about half of the rate a year earlier.

""Sales activity was extremely strong for the first full month of summer. Normally we would see sales dip in July relative to June as more households take vacation, especially with children out of school,"" said Lisa Patel, president of the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board.

article continues below

The board said 11,081 existing homes changed hands during July, 29.5 per cent more sales than July 2019 and a new record high for the month.

Average home prices are also up 16.9 per cent from a year ago, at $943,710, the board said.

Patel said there is evidence the home market is tightening — with buyers competing as homes are being sold faster than new listings are added to the market.

""Competition between buyers continued to increase in many segments of the GTA ownership housing market in July, which fuelled a further acceleration in year-over-year price growth in July compared to June,"" said the board's chief market analyst, Jason Mercer.

Patel suggested that homebuyers and sellers have put off summer travel and are playing catch-up on their housing plans, after the City of Toronto entered Stage 3 of reopening from COVID-19 restrictions.

Davelle Morrison, broker at Bosley Real Estate Ltd., agreed that months in lockdown have given buyers time to think about exactly what they want in a home. Research done, buyers are coming to the market ready to sign on the dotted line, she said.

""People have had three months to sit and observe what they want for their living space,"" said Morrison. ""People are starting to recognize that the Toronto real estate market holds value. They thought there would be a crash, and they were waiting for one. The time period to get a deal was March and April, and it is over . . . so people aren't on the sidelines anymore.""

Nasma Ali, founder of One Group Toronto Real Estate, said sellers often spend winter months prepping their house to sell in spring, when the greenery will improve their curb appeal. The listings that usually crowd the market in March and April came all at once this year — in June.

Last summer, buyers would have been fatigued by the stressful process of making offers. Listings that hit the market in spring usually pile up a bit more by summer, she added.

But this year, that process has sped up, she said.

""Spring never came, and when June came ... I could feel the difference in demand. The demand was just on fire,"" said Ali.

That raises the question of how long the pent-up demand will fuel the market, Ali says.

""People are always waiting for a crash, and now people are waiting for a crash in fall,"" Ali says. ""(Unlike in June,) houses are not selling with 10 to 20 offers. . . . . August is historically slow, people want to enjoy the last few weeks of summer and look again after Labour Day. ""

Morrison said that even among pessimists, she’s seeing a strong urge to move, with one client looking for a backyard in case schools close again in the future.

""People are saying, ‘We realized we won't be able to travel for the next couple of years, we need a getaway that’s local,’"" says Morrison.

But both Ali and Morrison noted that the market for detached houses is different from the condo or rental markets.

TRREB said low-rise homes, especially outside the downtown core, led the upward trend, with overall prices jumping most in Durham, Orangeville and South Simcoe county. The bulk of sales for July were detached homes (5,633 sold) and condo apartments (2,423 sold).

""Condo sales downtown are slower and there are so many factors. The obvious factor is Airbnbs, which have flooded the rental market as more of those investors chose a one-year rental rather than selling,"" said Ali.

""A lot of people are saying they are done with condo living. There is no immigration and that was a huge driving force of urban living.""

Morrison also said landlords are having a harder time filling rental spaces amid a greater supply of condos for rent, alongside unemployment among tenants. While mortgage deferral programs will end in the autumn, Morrison said she’s not sure how many houses will hit the market as a result.

As prices rose again in July, TRREB said it supports housing affordability measures that increase the supply of housing.

The real estate board reiterated support for building more ""missing middle"" housing, such as low-rise apartments and townhouses, as well as a provincial push for transit-oriented communities.

On the other hand, the board did decry any policy suggestion that capital gains tax should be applied to the sale of a principal residence, saying a tax would not help bridge the wealth-creation gap between renters and owners.

""The long-term solution to housing affordability in Canada, for both ownership and rental, is to ensure that there are adequate and appropriate types and tenures of housing available in the market,"" said TRREB chief executive John DiMichele.

Multiple bids are coming in for desirable properties despite worldwide uncertainty about the implications of the pandemic.

Justin Cownden, real estate agent with Pemberton Holmes Real Estate, said a client decided not to make an offer on a Shawnigan Lake house last month because 10 offers had already been submitted. The successful bid came in above asking price with no conditions.

Cownden is seeing a “lot of activity,” in all levels of the market as it rebounds after cooling during the first months of the pandemic.

Similar to last month, sales of $2-million-plus properties in the capital region climbed. High-end sales skew the average price.

In July a total of 30 single-family-homes sold for more than $2 million and of those, four went for more than $4 million. In July of last year, there were nine single-family sales of more than $2 million, the board said Wednesday.

As well, five condominiums sold for more than $1 million.

In June, 23 single-family houses sold for more than $2 million.

Developer Stan Sipos earlier sold 80 per cent of the 57 units in his Customs House luxury condominium project overlooking Victoria Harbour and expects to release the remaining units for sale in the fall. Those will probably be priced at $1.8 million to $6 million. The penthouse sold for $11 million.

“We are getting lots of calls. Lots of interest from all over the place,” including the U.S., Sipos said.

Victoria is appealing because it is quiet, offers a good lifestyle and has fared well during the global crisis, he said.

Sipos has heard of multiple offers for Oak Bay properties and of two sales which took place over video applications without the buyer being present.

Real estate board president Sandi-Jo Ayers said sales numbers in the capital region were unusually high for June and July.

“But we are not in a typical season. We cannot derive an ongoing trend nor forecast by looking at activity because we know the market is subjected to unusual factors amidst a health crisis.”

It is likely that spring demand moved into the summer, she said.

“Time will tell if these factors are resulting in a very compressed cycle of activity or if this trend will persist in the fall.”

The benchmark value for a single-family house in the core area was $910,400 last month, up from $861,100 in the same month a year ago.

A benchmark represents changes in value for a typical home in a specific area, a measure which real estate boards say is more representative than an average price. The core area is made up of Victoria, Saanich, Esquimalt, Oak Bay, and View Royal.

A long-term, low supply of properties for sale is continuing in this area, Ayers said.

“Though we had a good number of new listings come to market this month, many of those listings were snapped up by buyers.

By the end of July, there were 2,653 active listings — 10 per cent fewer properties than in July 2019.

“Right now we have a lot of demand for single-family homes without the numbers to meet demand — prospective buyers are often entering into multiple offer, competitive situations or are unable to find appropriate properties,” Ayers said.

For the area north of the Malahat, Vancouver Island Real Estate Board president Kevin Reid also noted interest in single-family homes.

“An interesting development we’re noting is that there seems to be more demand for single-family homes and less interest in condominiums and townhouses at the moment.

“It makes us wonder whether quarantine and lockdown have instilled a desire for more space among buyers.”

A total of 892 units sold last month, a four per cent decline from July of last year.

The benchmark price of a single-family home board-wide was $545,700 in July, an increase of six per cent from the previous year.

The chimney project — costing hundreds of thousands of dollars — is part of an overall upgrade of the 1892 heritage building at 2110 Store St., purchased from B.C. Hydro by developer Chris Le Fevre.

It’s one of two projects Le Fevre is working on at the northern edge of Old Town. The other is his new Ironworks development, with 85 condominiums plus commercial space at Store and Chatham streets, across from Capital Iron.

The Powerhouse’s chimney was wrapped up for safety reasons and scaffolding has been installed. Le Fevre said it hasn’t been touched for decades, so a “substantial portion” of the masonry is being rebuilt.

He would not be specific, but said the cost to remediate the 20,000-square-foot building is several million dollars.

The former industrial building is now rented by Metropol Industries, which specializes in printing and marketing. Le Fevre said work on the exterior of the Powerhouse, and “cleaning the building up,” has been ongoing for nearly a year.

Le Fevre first built an access road into the property, required by the city for the Powerhouse to be subdivided from the adjacent B.C. Hydro lands.

The Powerhouse was constructed to a high industrial standard. Le Fevre calls it the most rugged heritage building he has worked with. “The reason is that it was built originally as a blast-proof building because it was generating power with generators.”

It was designed by architect and former mayor John Teague — who also designed Victoria City Hall — and is listed on the federal-provincial register of Canada’s historic places.

“The value of this building lies in its solid purpose-built form, simple Romanesque detailing, and large, open interior spaces,” says the register. “This powerhouse is an edifice in the Upper Harbour industrial area, and contributes to the diversification of Victoria’s architectural heritage.”

Built as a steam-generating plant, the Powerhouse provided power for the city’s newly electrified street lights and the city’s early trams, the register says. “It facilitated the modernization of the city as it grew in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.”

Just to the south, Le Fevre’s five-storey Ironworks development at Store and Chatham streets has been completed. It is the first phase of Ironworks, with a second stage of a similar size planned.

The name and the rust-coloured corten exterior of Ironworks were chosen to reflect the area’s industrial past.

The former Albion Iron Works was on Chatham Street and the Capital Iron building across the street was originally a marine-scrap business. Le Fevre said he spotted rusted metal on the landscape when he was riding his motorcycle in the high desert in California, and decided that kind of look would suit the exterior of his Ironworks project.

The first occupants move into Ironworks in early August. The project was 60 per cent pre-sold and remaining units are going on the market in a couple of weeks, he said.

Commercial space will likely be taken up by a restaurant, coffee shops and smaller food-service outlets.

Le Fevre has redeveloped more than 10 Old Town buildings, repurposing often rundown structures for residential and commercial uses.

After 17 years, he is nearing completion on his Railyards development on the north side of the Point Ellice Bridge. Construction starts next year on the final building, featuring townhouses and micro-sized affordable units. Once that’s finished, about 400 homes will have been constructed in the Railyards.

Le Fevre has other projects underway, including townhouses in Ucluelet, as well as townhouses and commercial space in Revelstoke’s historic district. He has also purchased more than 600 acres in Landers and the Joshua Tree area in California, where he plans to build small homes.

The CRD sold the building for $11.1 million to a Vancouver real estate investment firm — named only as 836 Viewfield Limited Partnership — which has agreed to a long-term lease for the entire 59,000-square-foot facility with the brewery.

“This is really exciting for us,” said Driftwood partner Gary Lindsay, noting that, once the space has been renovated, they will be able to consolidate all three of the brewer’s operations in one location.

The warehouse was one of two massive spaces the CRD purchased on Viewfield Road in 2014 for $17 million. The four-acre site was considered for a sewage-sludge plant.

An outcry from neighbours killed the proposed plant scheme, and the CRD put the two properties — 808 Viewfield Rd. and 836 Viewfield Rd. — up for sale.

Spinnakers Brew Pub, which had been leasing space in one of the warehouses for three years, purchased 808 Viewfield Rd. for $11.25 million last year.

Lindsay said Driftwood considered purchasing the 836 Viewfield property, where it had been leasing about 20,000 square feet of space for its bottling and canning operation, but realized it would be too expensive to buy the lot and move the brewery as well.

“This will be quite a change for us as we have been operating out of three locations — the brewery on Hillside [Avenue], our distribution warehouse and sales office on Ellery Street and the packaging space,” he said.

Lindsay said demolition and renovations are expected to start soon, with hopes that they will move the brewery over and open in spring 2021.

The new space will allow the brewery to play a bit of catch-up with the times. When it started in 2008, there were no tasting rooms attached to breweries, and the Hillside Avenue location never had enough space for them to expand.

“Part of this move will mean having a customer experience like Phillips Brewing has here and like most craft brewers in Vancouver,” Lindsay said.

“It’s an opportunity to be at a place where people can come and spend a little time, COVID permitting.”

Lindsay said the success of Driftwood, which rode the second wave of craft beer expansion when it started in 2008, has paved the way for such a move.

“We were the victims of our own success in a way. It was the problem we always wished for — not having enough space,” he said.

That is no longer a problem, though he said they are still trying to navigate their way though the pandemic.

He said while the volume of alcohol being sold might have increased overall, local brewers report sales to bars and restaurants are way down. That has improved slightly as more venues open.

“People forget the tourist piece in Victoria and downtown Vancouver is huge and that has not been filled,” he said. “At the same time, the local market has been fantastic for us.”

He said they have reaped the reward of starting their canning lines two and half years ago.

The move to Viewfield Road creates something of a craft beer hot spot as it will now sit across the street from Lighthouse Brewing and connects to the Four Mile Pub via the Galloping Goose Regional Trail.

The CRD has done well in the real estate game with the two warehouses, which will in turn benefit taxpayers.

Apart from the $3.7-million net profit expected from the combined sales of the lots, the warehouses had been covering their costs via lease agreements over the past few years.

“This is good news for taxpayers, as this positive return on investment will be credited to the Core Area Wastewater Treatment Project participants,” said Susan Brice, chairwoman of the CRD’s governance and finance committee.

“CRD staff did an incredible job managing the property, generating positive cash flow and securing tenants that are remaining in place after the change in ownership. Taxpayers will end up benefiting from the improvements and sale of this asset.”

A condo self-insurance plan would be many times bigger and more complicated than that.","A new idea has bubbled up in the legislature since the condo insurance crisis started boiling over. It’s the concept of self-insurance — providing a means for condo residents to manage their own insurance coverage.

They now rely on insurance companies who last year started jacking rates up by a shocking degree and raised deductibles even more, in the face of losses in that market.

article continues below

Many strata councils have to share some of the blame. The losses stem mostly from constant water-damage claims, 11,000 in the peak year of 2018.

Many of them arise from lax strata boards adopting a habit of relying on insurance rather than maintaining properties properly.

The NDP government has introduced legislation in response to the skyrocketing premium and deductible increases. But the measures simply won’t make much difference to thousands of residents who this year are paying several times more than they did last year, for far less coverage.

The bill was introduced simply because the government had to do something. The crisis is so acute — and the effects are going to be so pervasive — that some kind of action had to be started. So officials put together a few marginal changes to buy some time until there’s a better idea.

There’s already a potential one at hand that needs a close look. A handful of readers suggested self-insurance to me during earlier coverage of this crisis in March.

Now an MLA is endorsing the concept.

Liberal critic Mike de Jong explored self-insurance as an option in the legislature last week and talked himself into supporting it.

Now all he has to do is talk the government into the same position. That will be an uphill struggle. NDP ministers don’t normally look to Liberals for good ideas. They shunned legislation the Opposition proposed to deal with the condo crisis.

But the problem is so serious, they might have to broaden their horizons. And the COVID-19 emergency has overtaken some of the old battle lines, which might change the dynamics.

Recalling the origins of the credit union movement after the Second World War — when farmers couldn’t get loans from banks they essentially started their own — de Jong said: “ They took matters into their own hands.”

He said the idea of pooling resources and looking after each other has merit on the condo scene.

Particularly because B.C. is the only place in Canada that provides the legal framework needed for such a scheme.

Entities created to insure certain limited pools are called “captive insurance companies.” There about 20 of them in B.C., the only such designated ones in Canada. Most are obscure firms that provide coverage to a very small class of clients.

It would be a big change and take a huge amount of work to create such an arrangement. It would also likely need transitional funding from government to get started.

De Jong said: “I believe it’s possible. I don’t think it’s possible on the fly. I think it requires a commitment from the government.”

Condo residents now are facing a situation where de Jong characterized insurance companies’ attitude as: “Take it or leave it. We don’t like the risk profile. Those are our rates. Too bad for you if they’re going to increase 70 per cent, 200 per cent, 300 per cent or 400 per cent.”

He said in a self-insurance scheme strata boards would be “pretty guarded” about the damage claims it accepts and more motivated to keep maintenance up to date because payouts would be made out of residents’ own pockets, rather than some overseas insurance company.

“This is something that I believe is worth pursuing. What we have now is not acceptable.”

The NDP bill currently being debated would allow strata boards to dip into contingency funds to pay premiums and toughens requirements for maintenance reporting. It generally requires more disclosure by strata councils and imposes more clarity.

It doesn’t tackle runaway premium hikes.

The closest model to what de Jong outlined is the Municipal Insurance Association of B.C., which covers all local governments.

It was developed after a similar insurance crisis in the 1980s and has offered dependable rates for years, even returning dividends to members.

A condo self-insurance plan would be many times bigger and more complicated than that. But there aren’t any better ideas around at present.

The mixed-use project will help transform the municipality, says Mayor Rob Martin, who expects neighbouring developer Seacliff Properties to seek rezoning this fall.

article continues below

Approval for Latoria South, “allows us to move forward from a bedroom community to a more dynamic economy,” Martin said.

Colwood’s commercial base is about to grow now that developer Gablecraft Homes intends to build an 80,000-square-foot retail village with a grocery store, other shops and services.

“We are really trying to build a liveable community and this really feeds into this,” Martin said.

New commercial development such as this will help ease the tax burden on homeowners, he said.

Gablecraft’s mixed-use project went to public hearing this week and council voted Wednesday in favour of rezoning to allow the project to proceed. Martin expects that the fourth and final reading of the bylaws will come up at council’s August meeting.

Royal Bay is the name given to the former site of a gravel pit on either side of Metchosin Road, south of Royal Roads University and north of Albert Head.

Gablecraft has already built about 300 single-family houses and townhomes on its Latoria North property, which is on the water side of the Metchosin Road, along with its Latoria South lands.

It is building out Latoria South with two neighbourhoods, the Commons and the Quarry. A range of housing types will go up with the market dictating the pace of construction. Plans include parks, trails, an elementary school, a satellite fire hall and a transit exchange. Other possibilities include seniors care and cultural uses. The tallest buildings would be six storeys.

Martin anticipates that buildings, such as the supermarket, will feature an interior design suited to a post-virus world.

He figures that the Seacliff lands, which include the waterfront at Royal Bay, will present a mixed-use plan similar in scope, creating a major hub of homes and commercial uses.

Colwood’s population is slightly more than 17,000. Projections say it could reach 35,000 in the next 25 years, Martin said.

Two organizations represent residents, the Royal Bay Community Association and the Royal Bay/Colwood Homeowners Association. The homeowners group has expressed concerns about losing privacy and views and contending with a noisier environment because of Gablecraft’s multi-storey building plans. They fear that traffic will be heavier and that issue needs to be looked at more closely.

The community association is keen to see the new amenities, particularly the commercial area and a supermarket, go ahead. That group praises the transportation plan, which has a transit exchange, cycling paths, sidewalks, and parks and trails.

A mix of opinions was expressed at the public hearing. One resident called Gablecraft’s plan a “thoughtful balanced development” with homes, waterfront and amenities such as coffee shops, and is looking forward to the project being constructed.

Another speaker said that while the project is a tremendous opportunity for Colwood, he fears that too many homes are going up on the space available. He worried that would lead to smaller lots and reduced street parking.

He recommended that the height of the buildings be restricted to four storeys, instead of six.

Developer GableCraft Homes of Vancouver is planning for a shopping village, a variety of home types and space for civic buildings and parks on a 158-acre site in an area called Latoria South.

article continues below

GableCraft has already built about 300 single-family houses and townhomes on its nearby Latoria North site and is planning for another 300, GableCraft president Lance Floer said Wednesday. Every year, about 100 homes are constructed in Latoria North.

Royal Bay is the name given to the former site of a gravel pit on either side of Metchosin Road, south of Royal Roads University and north of Albert Head. The Royal Bay Secondary School opened in 2015 on the west side of Metchosin Road and many homes have already been constructed nearby.

On the east or waterfront side of Metchosin Road, the former Producers Pit gravel operation was purchased in 2012 by B.C. Investment Management Corp., which sold it to GableCraft and another developer, Seacliff Properties, in 2017.

All of the waterfront portion of the property is owned by Seacliff, which hopes to obtain a rezoning in future for commercial and residential development on its 134 acres, which it is calling Royal Beach.

GableCraft has most of the upland portion of the property, where it’s seeking a rezoning to allow up to 2,100 homes, as well as alterations to Colwood’s Royal Bay plan, which is within the municipality’s official community plan. Approval would include design guidelines specific to Latoria South, which would govern things like building heights and features.

Council will also decide on whether to approve a site-specific comprehensive development zone for these lands, outlining allowed uses.

Before the vote, council will hear from citizens in the hearing via an online link.

Some nearby residents have written to city hall to express concern about the plans.

The Royal Bay/Colwood Homeowners Association is unhappy with what it described as a “wall” of attached housing replacing earlier plans for single-family housing. They fear taller buildings will result in a noisier environment.

They are also concerned about a loss of privacy, views and view corridors.

The association says it is not satisfied with a traffic report that was carried out, saying its scope was not broad enough and that it is likely to worsen, not alleviate, traffic problems in the area.

GableCraft said its proposal follows extensive community consultation, with three open houses staged in the past year and a half attended by hundreds of people.

The area dubbed Quarry would include 800 ground-oriented homes, either single-family or townhomes, Floer said. It would include seven acres for a 500-student elementary school, and a half-acre for a future satellite fire hall, plus parks.

The neighbourhood called Commons, a little over 40 acres, is planned as the commercial and mixed-use core of Royal Bay, Floer said. It would become another urban centre for the municipality, beyond Colwood Corners.

“For us, the centrepiece of that will be an almost 80,000-square-foot retail village that has the potential to expand over time as the community builds out,” he said. A 35,000-square-foot grocery store, coffee shops, cold beer and wine stores and a pharmacy are among uses envisioned.

The retail village would be located on the southeast corner of the intersection of Ryder Hesjedal Way and Latoria.

Other uses included in the rezoning application include seniors care, cultural and institutional uses, and a potential civic precinct if that’s something the municipality wants, he said.

The Commons would include construction of up to 1,300 homes, largely apartment-style condominiums, he said. There could be some purpose-built rental, as well.

“Obviously there will multiple parties who will eventually be constructing buildings,” Floer said.

“Our group will build the retail village and the first mixed-use residential as well.”

Most buildings would be six storeys at their tallest, with some four-storey buildings to the west of Ryder Hesjedal Way.

GableCraft’s proposal includes close to 17 acres devoted to parkland — neighbourhood parks, natural areas and trails — as well as a transition area between the two neighbourhoods.

A key feature of the entire Royal Bay development is creating connectivity for residents, whether via a linked trail network or cycling and driving links, he said. A transit exchange is in the plans.

The aim is to develop housing for middle-income buyers who would use the retail centre for their everyday needs, Floer said.

By the time the entire north and south sites are built out, the total population on GableCraft land could top 6,000.

If the rezoning application is approved, along with a subsequent development permit, construction of the retail village could start in early 2021, he said.

The residential component of the development will be market-driven, Floer said, and would likely start in the next couple of years.

The study of real estate activity from February to May 2019 looks at the sales-to-active-listings ratio (SAR) in each individual neighbourhood, for all property types combined. A figure over 20 per cent indicates a seller’s market, while 12 to 20 per cent is a balanced market, and below 12 is a buyer’s market.

REW found that 34 Island neighbourhoods are still seller’s markets. The three hottest areas were in South Jingle Pot in Nanaimo, Campbell River Central and Victoria’s Jubilee neighbourhood, all at 32 per cent SAR.

The study also broke out SAR by individual property type to find the strongest neighbourhood markets for detached house and condo sales, relative to supply.

Loblaw Companies Ltd., which began offering COVID-19 testing for patients at a handful of its Alberta pharmacy locations in June, plans to expand the program to all 234 of its pharmacies in the province by Sept. 1.

The company says it has reached out to all 10 provinces to discuss in-store testing outside Alberta, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford this week acknowledging the possibility.

The swab tests are only for those with no symptoms or any known contact with coronavirus patients and may be useful for teachers returning to school or Canadians who take care of an older family member, said Theresa Firestone, head of health and wellness at Shoppers Drug Mart. Loblaw-owned pharmacy locations include Shoppers stores as well as Independent Foods and No Frills.

""It's very convenient. We're in every community. The other plus is they don't have to line up with people who may have symptoms. We've shared that with Ontario and with other provinces, so at this point we’re looking forward to what they may decide,"" Firestone said.

London Drugs also conducts COVID-19 tests in Alberta. It began offering the service at six locations during the past two weeks and plans to roll it out at nine more by October. Like Shoppers, it bills Alberta Health Services for testing costs.

The service builds on other responses to the pandemic such as online pharmacist consultations and a pilot program where patients consult virtually with doctors in a private room in the store.

London Drugs is among the pharmacy retailers beefing up their role in a health-care system grappling with an aging population.

""With the extended hours of operation, you can basically go in when our stores are open and be able to find a pharmacist to ask a question. So what we’re able to do at that point is basically help triage the system,"" said Chris Chiew, head of pharmacy at the Richmond, B.C.-based retailer.

London Drugs has also hired diabetes educators to test blood sugar levels and assist patients with weight management and diet.

Shoppers has stepped even further into the realm of physicians, opening one of three planned medical clinics with doctors who cater to a roster of patients and walk-in services.

""There are a number of Canadians who don’t have access to a family physician. And we thought there was an opportunity for us to really play a role here in terms of access,"" Firestone said.

Drugstores can also handle the bureaucratic side of health care, freeing up doctors to spend more time with patients, she said.

""Looking for PPE (personal protective equipment), sorting out their waiting rooms so that people are socially distanced, managing virtual care...we’re able to take that burden on for them,"" Firestone said.

In 2018, Shoppers launched its Wellwise store chain to sell assisted-living devices aimed at older Canadians. More recently, it began to offer tips and videos online designed to help ward off depression and anxiety.

Metro Inc. declined to comment on any attempts to provide COVID-19 testing. The bulk of the company's Jean Coutu drugstores are located in Quebec, which unlike some provinces does not allow pharmacists to conduct testing via nose and mouth swabs.

The Bank of Nova Scotia's profit was weighed down in its latest quarter by mounting provisions for bad loans and its Latin American operations. The Toronto-based bank revealed Tuesday that its third-quarter profit slipped to $1.3 billion from $1.98 billion a year ago, while its provisions for credit losses totalled $2.18 billion for the quarter, up from $1.85 billion last quarter and $713 million in the year prior. ""We know that structural damage has been done to the economy. It's going to require a lot of quarters of clean up from here, but we do view this quarter's PCL as our high-water mark,"" Daniel Moore, the bank's chief risk officer, said during a conference call with financial analysts.

Patrick Cronin, the bank's chief risk officer, attributed the high provisions to the COVID-19 pandemic, but said he has confidence in the bank's ability to operate in such an environment.

The Canadian Association of Broadcasters issued a report on Wednesday warning of potential closures and widespread job cuts as private TV and radio broadcasters face a cumulative projected revenue shortfall of up to $1.06 billion by the end of 2022.

Most vulnerable are the country's AM radio stations, the report said, as well as other independent private radio and TV operations in smaller markets across the country.

The study, titled ""The Crisis in Canadian Media and the Future of Local Broadcasting,"" was commissioned by the CAB, which represents the majority of private broadcasters in Canada, and conducted through Winnipeg-based independent media economics consultancy Communications Management Inc.

The CAB says it's concerned about the fallout from a substantial erosion in local advertising revenues over recent months.

Radio stations may be hardest hit in the short term, the report suggests, partly due to many advertisers pulling back on their spending in the pandemic and hastening a decline in the media industry's revenues.

Private radio ad revenues are expected to be $383 million below last year, it said.

The report's projections suggest that without further government support those declines could mean as many as 50 private local radio stations go out of business over the next four to six months.

Another 150 radio stations could topple in the 18 months that follow, it said, leading to as many as 2,000 job losses.

The CAB is calling on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to take swift action by establishing a ""more fair and sustainable future"" for local media.

Last month, the organization sent an emergency application to the CRTC requesting permission for broadcasters to be relieved of certain terms of their agreements, such as spending requirements on Canadian programming, for the broadcast year that ends Aug. 31.

Lenore Gibson, chair of the CAB, said broadcasters have ""done their utmost to cut expenses"" in areas such as administration, and ""the last thing that they want to do is cut into programming costs, but that's the only area that's left now.""

The CAB is urging the federal government to provide emergency regulatory relief as well as greater ""targeted support"" for the industry starting this fall.

Without greater financial measures in place, the CAB says the effects could leave many communities with only national and international media organizations to provide them with most of their news, effectively eliminating most community coverage of local politics, health and education in some regions of the country.

Bo Horvat scored twice, and Tyler Toffoli and Elias Pettersson each had a goal and two assists as the Canucks defeated the Golden Knights 5-2 at Rogers Place.

article continues below

The best-of-seven second-round series is tied 1-1. Game 3 goes Thursday.

Forty-eight hours earlier, the Golden Knights, now 8-2 in the post-season, had manhandled the Canucks en route to a 5-0 pounding in Game 1.

""For us as a team we wanted to bounce back from Game 1. We weren't happy with that,"" said Pettersson.

""We played a good game. We should be happy about it but (we need) a short-term memory and be ready for Game 3.""

Goaltender Jacob Markstrom made 38 saves for the win while Robin Lehner stopped 22 shots for Vegas. It's the first time Vegas has allowed more than five goals in a game in the return-to-play tournament.

It was the first game back for Toffoli since the opening game of the qualifying round against the Minnesota Wild on Aug. 2. The NHL is not releasing information on injuries, but Toffoli had been seen in a walking boot.

Toffoli jumped over the boards for his first shift in the first period and scored nine seconds later, taking a cross-crease pass from Pettersson to put the puck into a yawning net. He then made it 2-0 on the power play, delivering a tape-to-tape pass to an incoming Horvat, who blasted it past Lehner.

""It's fun to get back in the lineup and get a big win and tie this series up,"" said Toffoli, who had been acquired at the trade deadline from the Los Angeles Kings. He had put up 10 points in his first 10 games with the Canucks before the regular season ended March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I made some phone calls yesterday, talked to a lot of people. It was a busy day,"" said Toffoli. ""It was good obviously getting the OK from everybody (to play). I got all excited. Felt like I was coming back to my first playoff series.""

Vancouver coach Travis Green said the 5-0 loss was their worst game of the playoffs and that Game 2 was a must-win.

""You go down two (games) against that team early in the series it would be tough and just mentally, too (to come back),"" he said.

""We were better with the puck, played a more direct game. I thought we were better on our feet, quicker. That's a good hockey team. I thought we did a good job of making them defend more than we did the first game.""

Despite being down by two goals in the second period, the Golden Knights looked like they were going to run the Canucks out of the rink again.

Markstrom kept the Canucks alive as Vegas tilted the ice and turned his net into a shooting gallery, blasting away for 22 shots in the period. Vegas got one goal back from Alex Tuch before Pettersson scored on a cross-ice feed from Alex Edler to make it 3-1 heading into the third.

""That really was a back-breaker,"" said Vegas head coach Peter DeBoer. ""You're down 3-1 and you have nothing to show for the work you put in to try and get back in the game.""

Tuch added: ""We knew Vancouver wasn't happy with the way they played last game and we knew they were going to come out flying. And we decided instead of being prepared, (to) be surprised by that for some reason.""

Vancouver iced the game 18 seconds into the third on Horvat's second goal. Then the frustration finally got to Vegas.

First, Max Pacioretty grabbed J.T. Miller by the head and threw him down after the whistle for a roughing penalty. Tuch got a double minor for pummelling Jake Virtanen while the Vancouver forward lay on the ice.

Pacioretty scored late for Vegas and Tanner Pearson added the final Vancouver goal into an empty net.

Horvat had not found the scoresheet since scoring two goals in each of the first two games against the St. Louis Blues in the first round.

Pettersson has been a steady point-getter throughout the playoffs but had been shut down by Vegas in Game 1, limited to no shots on net and one blocked shot.

Markstrom, in his first playoff series, has been the locomotive pulling the Canucks' playoff train. He allowed just nine goals on 121 shots (.926 save percentage) against Minnesota in the first round while registering his first playoff shutout. He saved 29 of 34 against the Blues (.930).

The series is being played at a fan-less Rogers Place. Players are isolating between contests to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This was Williams’ fifth match since professional tennis resumed amid the coronavirus pandemic after a hiatus of nearly six months — and all five have gone three sets. She is 3-2 in that stretch.

The result against No. 13 seed Sakkari, and particularly the way the match ended, was hardly promising for Williams as the U.S. Open’s start approaches next week.

The Western & Southern Open is usually held in Ohio but was moved to the U.S. Open’s site in Flushing Meadows this year to make for a two-event, no-spectator ""bubble"" during the pandemic.

In men's play, Canada's Milos Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Andy Murray. Raonic, from Thornhill, Ont., is the last Canadian remaining in the draw.

Williams was seemingly in control early, serving for the first set at 5-3, 30-0, when things began to unravel. She missed two backhands in a row, then put a forehand into the net to set up a break point, and walked over to the stand holding her towel at the back of the court (the ball people normally handle towels for players, but not during COVID-19).

That’s when chair umpire Aurelie Tourte called a time violation. On the following point, Williams sailed a forehand long to get broken.

At the ensuing changeover, the 23-time Grand Slam champion argued with Tourte, saying: ""I mean, I’m getting my own towels. That’s not fair. You should tell me on the sidelines next time if I need to play faster. Believe me, I will. ... You didn't even give me a warning.""

While Williams eventually did grab that set, she again frittered away a 5-3 lead in the second, plus a 4-1 edge in the tiebreaker. When she sat after the second set, the 38-year-old American tossed her racket over her shoulder the way an office worker might flip a crumpled piece of paper toward a trash can.

Williams came out flat in the third set, as if she’d rather be anywhere else. She double-faulted four times in the second game, including on Sakkari’s eighth break chance, to make it 2-0 and that was pretty much that.

Hours earlier, Novak Djokovic’s neck felt much better, and his tennis looked much better, in a 6-2, 6-4 victory over unseeded American Tennys Sandgren that improved the No. 1-ranked man to 20-0 in 2020.

""Actually, I’m pleasantly surprised with the way I recovered and felt today — just overall, physically, but also with the neck, specifically, because that was a little bit of a concern,"" said Djokovic, who will be eyeing his 18th Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open. ""Going back four, five days, I did struggle quite a lot.""

Djokovic was treated by a trainer and played sluggishly in his opening match Monday, but he was at his best from the outset against Sandgren and saved all four break points he faced.

Djokovic will face 34th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff in the quarterfinals. The other quarterfinal in the top half of the draw will be defending champion Daniil Medvedev against No. 8 seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Reilly Opelka, a 6-foot-11 American who is ranked 39th, delivered 19 aces and knocked off 2019 U.S. Open semifinalist Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 7-6 (4). Opelka next meets No. 4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, whose 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4) win over No. 16 John Isner was interrupted by a rain delay of nearly 1 1/2 hours late in the first set.

Also interrupted by the weather was Raonic's victory over the three-time Grand Slam champion. Raonic, a Wimbledon runner-up in 2016, has held all 29 games he’s served so far in the tournament.

""I have done the work,"" Raonic said. ""I have put in the effort, and I'm just happy that this quickly the pieces are coming together.""

This was Murray's first tournament appearance since November. He missed time due to a pelvic injury and is playing on a metal hip after two operations on that joint.

""Didn’t play well. It was not a good day,"" Murray said. ""The positives are that I got three matches in. Physically, I pulled up OK.""

Women’s quarterfinal matchups set earlier in the day were two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka against Anett Kontaveit, former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka against Ons Jabeur, and 83rd-ranked American qualifier Jessica Pegula against No. 14 Elise Mertens.

He was 5 under after the front nine Tuesday at Ozarks National when he hit driver at the par-4 10th. The ball wound up in such heavy rough that Mickelson couldn't find it, forcing him to take a penalty stroke. He still wound up making a long putt to salvage bogey, and that gave him some momentum for the rest of the round.

""I was able to get right back to even par on the back side with a birdie on the next hole, and then I made a couple more coming in,"" said Mickelson, whose 7-under 64 left him 17 under.

That was good for a four-shot lead over Tim Petrovic and Rod Pampling, who will be his playing partners for the final round. Mike Weir of Bright's Grove, Ont., (69) was nine shots off the lead at 8 under.

""I've been putting really well,"" Mickelson said. ""Today I didn't drive it the way I've been driving it. I kind of a hung a few drives, so I'm going to the range and try to work on that now. But when I come out tomorrow I'll try to be a little bit more aggressive with the driver and see if I can make a few more birdies.""

A few more? He's already made 19 of them in his first 36 holes.

Playing in the final group and with the shadows getting long, Mickelson picked up right where he left off after his opening-round 61. He made birdie at the third and then rattled off three straight beginning at the par-4 fifth, where he nearly chipped in for eagle.

Petrovic tried to make a run at Mickelson, but even one of his career-low rounds only got him so close. His putter went cold down the stretch and a poor approach at the par-4 finishing hole resulted in bogey.

Mickelson added a bridie at the ninth, the only hole he bogeyed on Monday, after a pretty flop shot over the bunker. After the lost ball at the 10th, Mickelson responded by adding two more birdies.

The second of them at the par-3 12th was a backhanded tap-in. His approach shot barely carried onto the front edge of the green, then nestled up to about an inch from the hole.

Mickelson could still squander the lead in the final round Wednesday, when tee times were moved to the early morning because of expected bad weather in the afternoon. But given the quality of his short game through 36 holes, the more pressing question is whether he could break the PGA Tour Champions' 54-hole scoring record of 191 — shared by Bruce Fleisher, Loren Roberts, Bernhard Langer, David Frost and Rocco Mediate.

Mickelson, who decided to make his debut on the over-50 tour to continue his U.S. Open prep after he was eliminated from the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, would need to shoot 65 in his final round Wednesday to move atop the list.

Petrovic and Pampling each shot 64-65 over the first two rounds. Rocco Mediate struggled coming in and was at 12 under.

K.J. Choi was another shot back, and Steve Stricker and David McKenzie were at 10 under.

A no-fan no-no.

With the seats at Guaranteed Rate Field empty, Giolito pitched the first no-hitter of the pandemic-delayed season, striking out 13 in leading the White Sox over the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 Tuesday night.

""2020 has been a very strange year,"" said Giolito, who conducted a postgame interview while wearing a mask. ""Obviously a lot of weird stuff going on with COVID and the state of the world, so may as well throw this in the mix.""

Sounds like he didn't mind that nobody saw it. Well, almost no one.

After right fielder Adam Engel extended on the run to catch Erik Gonzalez’s slicing drive toward the line for the final out, the hollers of Giolito’s teammates in the middle of the diamond echoed around the stadium.

""I’m just stoked for Lucas and so happy and ecstatic and emotional for Lucas,"" Engel said. ""It stinks we couldn’t celebrate the way most no-hitters get celebrated.""

The smallest crowd listed for any no-hitter in the majors over the last 100 years came in 1944, when a mere 1,014 watched Cincinnati’s Clyde Shoun beat the Braves at Crosley Field.

Nowhere close to that number on this night, not with the park that holds over 40,000 closed to fans because of virus protocols.

Suffice to say, years from now when White Sox fans fondly remember Giolito’s gem, there will not be, say, 100,000 or so people claiming they were there to see it in person.

At one point early in the game, some members of grounds crew drifted in sight, but that was about it outside of the teams.

An All-Star last year, the 26-year-old Giolito (3-2) matched his career high for strikeouts set in his previous start against Detroit.

Only a four-pitch walk to Gonzalez leading off the fourth inning got in Giolito’s way of perfection. That was only runner he permitted while throwing 101 pitches

""I’ve been working for this type of game for a while now and it’s really cool that we got it done,"" Giolito said.

Giolito relied on his changeup and fastball to make quick work of the Pirates, who came into the game batting just .229 and have the worst record in the majors. Six of their starters finished the game hitting under .199 this season.

The White Sox rushed toward the mound after the final out in Giolito’s first career no-hitter. Giolito hugged catcher James McCann as the Chicago players joined the party.

The South Side of Chicago normally rattles with fireworks after a home win -- this is the club that gave the game the exploding scoreboard -- but the park remained silent as the dugout emptied.

Giolito, meanwhile, was locked in his own zone in the later innings, fully aware of what was at stake.

""After the seventh, six more outs, looking at who I was facing, became very, very, very possible,"" he said, ""and then we were able to get it done.""

Giolito said his approach never wavered.

""Just staying with the same, like, mental routine for every single pitch. One pitch at a time. Full focus, full execution, straight through the target,"" he said.

Giolito pitched the 19th no-hitter in White Sox history — second most to the Dodgers' 23 — and first since Philip Humber threw a perfect game at Seattle in 2012. This was the seventh time the Pirates have been held hitless, with Washington’s Max Scherzer having done it in 2015.

White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson made a nifty play on a grounder by Bryan Reynolds up the middle in the seventh to preserve the gem, helped by first baseman Jose Abreu’s stretch at the bag.

In the ninth, Gonzalez hit a liner that Engel, a fleet centre fielder for most of his career, caught on the run at knee-high height.

""Yeah man, I think I got it,"" Gonzalez said. ""With that at-bat, I was a little bit mad because I don’t want to be part of history.""

Giolito improved to 30-28 in his big league career. He made his debut with Washington in 2016, then was traded after that season to the White Sox in a package for outfielder Adam Eaton.

Giolito gave up a major league-high 118 earned runs in 2018, his first full season in Chicago.

""I was pretty much bottom of the league in almost every stat,"" Giolito said. ""I kind of had to ... learn from failure to learn my true potential.""

He added: ""I always envisioned that I’d throw a no-hitter in the big leagues.""

Giolito threw the first no-hitter at Guaranteed Rate Field since Minnesota’s Francisco Liriano did it in 2011.

The White Sox, who’ve won eight of their last nine, ended the Pirates’ season-best winning streak at three games.

Giolito was dominant in his previous start, too, fanning 13 against Detroit and allowing just three hits in seven innings. The victory over Pittsburgh was his third career shutout.

Chicago’s first three batters reached in the second and all three came home one at a time after Engel’s groundout and singles Anderson and Eloy Jimenez. McCann added a sacrifice fly in the third off Steven Brault (0-1).

TRAINER’S ROOM

Pirates: RH reliever Keone Kela was available to pitch after leaving Friday’s loss to Milwaukee with forearm tightness. … Infielders Colin Moran (collision) and Kevin Newman (abdomen) also were on the bench after leaving Sunday’s game.

White Sox: McCann stayed in the game after being struck near his left hand by a second-inning pitch from Brault. ... Jimenez appeared to be getting treatment near the mound after the celebration, but manager Rick Renteria said he walked off under his own power.

UP NEXT

LHP Dallas Keuchel (4-2, 2.65) looks for his third straight win Wednesday afternoon against Pirates RHP Trevor Williams (1-4, 3.70).

His team gave up a goal he felt shouldn't have counted three minutes into the opening period and had a subsequent equalizer called back on a razor-thin offside challenge.

Down 1-0 in the series and playing well, Tampa Bay then grabbed its first lead in more than 110 minutes of action midway through the third period only to see Boston tie it up with under four minutes to go in regulation.

""Adversity strikes in the weirdest ways,"" Cooper said. ""You never know when it's going to happen.

""Sometimes you're just dealt ... a sandwich that doesn't taste very good, if you know what I mean.""

And deal with it they did.

Ondrej Palat scored at 4:40 of overtime as the Lightning defeated the Bruins 4-3 to even their second-round playoff series 1-1.

Blake Coleman added two goals in regulation for the Lightning, while Nikita Kucherov had the other. Andrei Vasilevskiy made 22 saves to get the win.

""If there was one message that was going on it was we liked everything that was going on about the game,"" Cooper said. ""I know it sounds so cliche, but we just had to stick with it. Some teams, if you have mental weakness at all, you're probably sitting there saying, 'Poor us.'

""But it's just not been this group. That's not how they operate.""

Brad Marchand buried his second of the night to tie things with under four minutes left in the third period for the Bruins, while Nick Ritchie also scored. David Pastrnak added two assists for Boston, which got 36 stops from Jaroslav Halak.

The teams don't have much time to digest the result, with Game 3 of the best-of-seven matchup set for Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET back inside the fan-less Scotiabank Arena.

Tampa, which beat the Columbus Blue Jackets in quintuple overtime of Game 1 in the opening round before closing out the series in the extra period of Game 5 on a pair of goals from Brayden Point, got the winner after Boston couldn't clear its zone.

Patrick Maroon tried a wraparound that Halak stopped, but Palat was there to bury the rebound to score his first of the post-season and send the Lightning pouring off their bench in celebration.

""It's obviously big-time frustrating any time you lose a game and especially in that fashion,"" Bruins centre Sean Kuraly said. ""We thought we were trending in the right direction, (thinking) momentum may be swinging our way. You get the puck close to the blue line a couple times and you don't get it out, and against a good team that's what happens.

""It ends up in the back of your net.""

Acquired prior to February's trade deadline from the New Jersey Devils, Coleman gave Tampa its first lead of the series at 10:40 of the third after taking a stretch pass from Victor Hedman. The Lightning centre moved in alone on Halak and snuck an off-speed shot through the five-hole after getting slashed by Bruins defenceman Connor Clifton.

Boston, however, responded with 3:58 left in regulation when Marchand finished off a pretty passing play. With the Bruins in the middle of a change — Patrice Bergeron would normally be on the ice — Kuraly took a feed from Pastrnak and quickly found Marchand to bury his sixth and knot things up.

The Bruins, who triumphed 3-2 in Game 1 on the back of Halak's 35-save performance, took a 2-1 lead with 5:27 left in the second on a power play when Pastrnak faked a one-timer before sliding a pass to Marchand at the side of the net.

Tampa responded 56 seconds later after some great work from Point. The diminutive centre twisted and turned in the Bruins zone before finding Kevin Shattenkirk, whose shot was tipped in by Kucherov for his third.

The Lightning dressed seven defencemen with Ryan McDonagh (undisclosed), who has averaged a team-high 26:07 of ice time in the post-season, out injured after leaving midway through the third period of Game 1. Veteran blue-liners Luke Schenn and Braydon Coburn drew in, while Carter Verhaeghe was scratched up front.

Boston owned the best record in the NHL when the league suspended its season because of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, but dropped to the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference after losing all three of its games in the round-robin portion of the restart.

The Bruins found their groove in the first round of the usual 16-team playoff bracket, disposing of the Carolina Hurricanes in five games.

Tampa, meanwhile, had the second-best mark in the East and was fourth overall when the schedule was halted. The Lightning finished second in the round-robin and then downed Columbus.

The Bruins jumped out to a 1-0 lead at 3:14 of Tuesday's first period after Tampa defenceman Zach Bogosian's stick disintegrated at the offensive blue line. Boston broke the other way, with Ritchie stuffing his first past Vasilevskiy, who thought he had the puck covered — much to Cooper's chagrin.

The Lightning responded a couple minutes later when Barclay Goodrow tipped Coburn's point shot up and over Halak. The Bruins, however, correctly challenged for offside after Point was a fraction of a second too slow exiting the Boston zone on the tag up.

Cooper fired a number of expletives at the officials when the call was reversed, but was back smiling on the bench after a surprising burst from an unlikely source eventually knotted the score.

Bogosian, a bruising blue-liner known mostly for his physical play, split two Boston defenders, and as he was getting knocked down fed a diving Coleman, who slid his second past Halak before crashing into the net at 12:42.

""I saw Bogo picking up some speed,"" Coleman said. ""He just kind of had that look in his eye like he was about to do something. I just made it a point to get up into play with him, try to give him an option.

""He made a heck of a play.""

It was also the first sign the Lightning weren't going to be fazed by that early adversity.

""Any time there's a mishap, you just turn the page,"" Cooper said of his roster. ""It was needed tonight, I'll tell you that, because they need to be rewarded for the work they were doing.

""And in the end, they were.""

The judges scored it 30-26, 30-27 and 29-28 for Romero. But White pointed out that the 23-year-old from Welland, Ont., failed to finish his damaged opponent and had trouble when Breeden switched to southpaw.

""He's 23 years old, he's a young kid. I absolutely positively think he's going to be in the UFC some day. Just not tonight,"" said White.

Breeden's leg buckled repeatedly in the third as Romero kept lashing him with kicks. But despite the damage from 25 kicks in total, Breeden kept coming forward and swinging.

""Those calf kicks were nasty,"" said Romero. ""My legs are actually hurting from them so you know they're pretty hard.""

The relaunch on Nov. 8 will allow all members to book seats on any Air Canada flight using Aeroplan points, a change from the current model where seat inventory is limited.

article continues below

It will eliminate the carrier surcharge — which varies from less than $25 to the high hundreds — on flights purchased with points, though a $39 fee applies for trips operated by Air Canada's partner airlines.

Members will also be able to share points with up to eight friends and family members, combining them in a pool anyone in the group may put toward a trip.

The airline hopes the relaunch, planned after it reacquired the rewards program from Aimia Inc. in January 2019, will add another two million members before 2024 to the five million-plus who already hold Aeroplan cards.

The new program, based in part on feedback from thousands of consumers, ""is more important than ever as airlines compete to earn and retain customer loyalty in a rapidly changing environment,"" CEO Calin Rovinescu said in a statement Tuesday.

Passenger revenues at the Montreal-based airline dropped by 95 per cent year over year in its second quarter, prompting 20,000 layoffs as the airline burned through $19 million of cash per day amid border closures and a collapse in demand stemming from the coronavirus.

Air Canada made last-minute tweaks to the rewards revamp in response to the outbreak, prioritizing partnerships with the Uber Eats app and other companies yet to be announced, said Mark Nasr, head of loyalty and e-commerce at the company.

""We did a lot of soul-searching as COVID-19 developed,"" Nasr said. ""We really accelerated these 'every day' partnerships.""

The points that members earn on purchases via eligible retail, hotel and credit card partners will count toward to the tally required to reach the lowest rung of ""elite status"" — 25,000 kilometres of air travel in a year.

For example, an Uber Eats purchase of $50 would yield 100 points for Aeroplan members, and another 50 to 75 points if it was made through a TD Aeroplan Visa card.

Frequent travellers in one of Aeroplan's five elite categories will be able to share benefits such as lounge access and priority boarding with friends and family, even if they are not flying together.

Current Aeroplan members will keep their account numbers and Aeroplan miles will be converted to points on a one-for-one basis, Air Canada said.

The new system will base the number of points earned for a given flight on airfare rather than distance, which currently provides the baseline. That means the points gap between a flight to Asia and a flight across the country will likely narrow, since the difference in distance is often greater than the difference in price.

Meanwhile the new, more flexible pricing model — Air Canada has posted a ""points predictor"" tool on its website — also means more popular routes and times will cost more points than under the current fixed system, while off-peak times and less popular routes will be cheaper, said National Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen.

""We see this as margin-enhancing for Air Canada as it will be able to effectively charge market prices for rewards seats for more popular flights. In addition, it will allow the airline to enhance load factors on less popular flights,"" Doerksen said in a research note.

A flight between Toronto and Vancouver will cost between 25,000 and 35,000 points, according to the points predictor.

The renewed focus on consumer spending — TD announced Tuesday a ""refreshed suite"" of Aeroplan Visa credit cards, set to launch Nov. 8 — expands the loyalty program's potential appeal well beyond the jet set.

""The cards are what drives massive amounts of value. If Bob or Betty don't travel much by air, they can still have a TD or a CIBC or Amex credit card and they can make points on the program,"" said Robert Kokonis, president of Toronto-based consulting firm AirTrav Inc.

""There's all that day-to-day household spending that you can put onto the card that really generates points for the member and through to the bottom line of Aeroplan and then Air Canada.""

The added incentive to plastic comes as a welcome change for Air Canada credit card partners Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Visa and American Express.

Air Canada has said credit card penetration for so-called elite flyers is only 38 per cent versus about 50 per cent for most U.S. airlines.

TD and CIBC paid a total of $1.2 billion to help offset the hefty points liability, acquisition price and other working capital and pension assumptions for Air Canada.

While Nîmes is most notable for its Roman sights, the city offers other things to enjoy, such as the carefully preserved old centre and thriving market hall.
Rick Steves (ricksteves.com) writes European travel guidebooks and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio.","A we have had to postpone our travels because of the pandemic, I believe a weekly dose of travel dreaming can be good medicine. Here’s a reminder of the fun that awaits us in Europe at the other end of this crisis.

Most travellers to southern France’s Provence region will visit Arles and Avignon, but ignore nearby Nîmes. While those two towns have name recognition and greater touristic appeal, Nîmes feels richer and more authentic. A visit to this thriving town rewards you with impressive Roman monuments and peaceful, pedestrian-polished streets that feel like a secret between its well-heeled residents.

article continues below

Born a Celtic city about 500 BC, Nîmes joined the Roman Empire in the first century BC Emperor Augustus made it a regional capital whose importance merited fine architecture, one of the longest protective walls in the Roman world, and a nearly 50-kilometre-long aqueduct to bring water to its growing population.

The core of Roman Nîmes was a temple called Maison Carrée (“Square House,” named before they had a word for rectangle). The temple rivals Rome’s Pantheon as the most complete and splendid building that survives from the Roman Empire. Maison Carrée survived in part because it has been in constant use for the past thousand years — from a temple to a church, to a city hall, to a people’s art gallery after the Revolution, and finally, as the monument travellers see today.

Nîmes also had an impressive amphitheatre for entertaining residents. Today, this arena — one of the best-preserved of the Roman world — is a superb example of Roman engineering, with its perfectly symmetrical oval shape, seating for 24,000 spectators, 60 passageways to prevent bottlenecks, a system of underground rooms and a lift used to hoist animals up to the floor for gladiator games. Touring the place provides an interesting history lesson, and climbing to the top offers the rare opportunity to enjoy city views from the nosebleed seats of a Roman arena.

Facing the arena is the Roman World Museum (Musée de la Romanité), with its high-tech interactive stations that help show off 5,000 artifacts from Roman Nîmes (plus a few from pre-Roman and medieval times). A highlight is its rich collection of Latin-inscribed stones and mosaics — some of which were discovered when digging the garage for the site.

As one of ancient Europe’s privileged cities, Nîmes needed a reliable water supply. So in about 19 BC, the Romans built a 50-kilometre-long aqueduct. While most of the aqueduct is on or below ground, one stretch is especially impressive: the Pont du Gard. About 30 minutes northeast of Nîmes, this bridge stretches over the Gardon River and is one of the most remarkable surviving Roman ruins anywhere.

Throughout the ancient world, aqueducts heralded the greatness of Rome. Even after many visits here, I’m forever impressed by the skill of ancient Roman engineers. This structure, built with perfectly cut stones fitted together without mortar, was designed to slope ever so slightly — less than an inch every hundred yards — to let water flow effortlessly into Nîmes.

There are many ways to enjoy the Pont du Gard. Visitors can hike to viewpoints, join a guided walking tour through the top channel of the aqueduct, and see its fine museum, where exhibits show the immensity of the undertaking. Summers are a great time to visit, as you can enjoy a picnic by the water, swim or canoe in the river and stay into the evening, when a light show is projected on the monument.

After seeing the Pont du Gard, it’s especially interesting to visit the castellum of Nîmes, the distribution tank marking the end of the aqueduct. Examining the castellum’s water-distribution holes, you can appreciate them as evidence of Roman Nîmes’ social compassion. The lower channel served top-priority needs, providing water via stone and lead pipes to the public wells that graced neighbourhood squares. The higher holes — which got wet only when the supply was plentiful — routed water to the homes of the wealthy, to public baths, and to nonessential fountains.

While Nîmes is most notable for its Roman sights, the city offers other things to enjoy, such as the carefully preserved old centre and thriving market hall. Another fine activity is strolling the Jardin de la Fontaine, a lavish park filled with Baroque sculptures and an ornate network of canals and paths. Finished just 50 years after the construction of Versailles, the Jardin de la Fontaine has special significance to the French, as these were the first grand gardens not meant for a king, but for the public.

Perhaps the most appealing part of Nîmes is its mellowness. It’s a great place to slow down and enjoy the inviting café scene, wander the traffic-free lanes, and savour a tranquil, less-touristed slice of southern France.

But that will change on Saturday when regular weekend boat tours begin, Halifax MP Andy Fillmore announced Thursday.

Parks Canada says the island will be open for guided tours for the next five weekends. A tour boat will leave the Cable Wharf every 40 minutes until the last run from the island at 5:10 p.m.

The island was fortified by the British military in 1750 and served as a detention centre during the deportation of Nova Scotia's Acadian population between 1755 and 1763.

Its military installations include Fort Charlotte, which is known for housing two seaward-facing artillery batteries and a spooky underground tunnel complex. The lower battery on the south side of the island includes several massive canons from the 1860s.

Georges Island is also the site of one of Canada's first fully automated lighthouses.

""For generations, Georges Island ... has remained out of reach to Haligonians and visitors alike,"" Fillmore said. ""Access to this emerald gem in Halifax Harbour will immerse visitors in the diverse history and ecology of this iconic landmark, while enjoying Halifax from a whole new vantage point.""

In late 2019, the federal government spent more than $2 million to build a permanent wharf with floating docks. In the future, the floating docks will offer access to water taxis and recreational boats.

Upon arrival on the island, visitors can expect to walk up a gravel path to Fort Charlotte, where interpreters will present the island's history and provide short tunnel tours through the lower level rooms and halls of the lower battery.

Visitors will be required to wear non-medical masks or face coverings and to follow public health recommendations including physical distancing.

Tours can be booked online at visitgeorgesisland.com or by phone at one of the Ambassatours waterfront kiosk.

Concerns about the level of detail airlines provide have been greatest in B.C., where the provincial health officer has lamented a lack of movement from federal officials.

In a letter to Transport Minister Marc Garneau, the B.C. government noted the information the province has received from airlines is ""not necessarily complete and is sometimes unusable.""

B.C. Transport Minister Claire Trevena said the data often includes the names of travel agencies that booked flights, a frequent flyer number, or the person who booked the ticket but not necessarily the name and contact information of the person who actually flew on the plane.

She urged the government to ""ensure the data gathered is usable and traces back to the individual traveller directly,"" rather than simply listing flights with a positive COVID-19 case.

""We have come so far together as a country with much success to curb the spread of COVID-19,"" reads the letter. A copy was provided to The Canadian Press.

""As we restart our economy, however, we want to ensure all passengers and communities remain safe and that nobody is put at risk due to any oversight.""

Garneau and Trevena spoke on Wednesday afternoon, his spokeswoman said. Livia Belcea said in an email that Garneau committed to create a way for airlines to share passenger data to trace ""individuals who may have been exposed to COVID 19 while on a domestic flight.""

The Public Health Agency of Canada already requires airlines to provide information on travellers arriving on international flights, who are subject to strict quarantine rules, but it's domestic flights where issues have arisen.

The divide in talks between Ottawa and the airlines appears to fall along whether phone numbers or email addresses are enough, or if residential addresses, for instance, should also be part of any handover.

Mike McNaney, president of the National Airlines Council of Canada, said in a statement that flight information is provided when requested, ""per established procedures for communicable diseases"" and usually in less than 24 hours.

""Our members are fully committed to protecting public safety,"" the statement said.

Public health officials tried to trace contacts for every person early on in the pandemic, but those efforts slowed as people were ordered to stay home or quarantine, and as travel dropped.

Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said Tuesday there could be improvements to the data that airlines provide, noting flight manifests lack all sorts of details that make it difficult to reach people in certain seats.

Tam also said there hasn't been a confirmed case of in-flight transmission.

""Very few of our cases actually come from travellers at the moment,"" she said. ""But now that our case numbers have gone down, there's been more interest in why don't we follow some of these planes and see if there's been any contact at all that's been exposed or transmitted.""

The federal health agency she leads referred further questions to Transport Canada, which had previously referred questions to the health agency.

Air operators have to record the names of everyone on board an aircraft, but there is no federal requirement that they submit passenger manifests to Transport Canada, said Belcea.

NDP transport critic Niki Ashton said the federal government needs to take a harder line on carriers to provide the necessary information for contact tracing.

""Airlines should be making sure that accurate information is being shared as soon as possible and it shouldn't be up to them to pick and choose how they do it,"" she said. ""It should be the federal government mandating them.""

The Air Passenger Rights organization sought leave to appeal Monday a Federal Court of Appeal decision that dismissed the group's attempt for an injunction compelling the Canadian Transportation Agency to remove a post about refunds from its website temporarily while a broader case about the statement's validity is ongoing.

article continues below

The CTA said in March that airlines have the right to issue travel credits instead of a refund for cancelled trips in the ""current context,"" though the agency later clarified that the online statement was ""not a binding decision.""

Canadian airlines have generally offered credit valid for two years or more but avoided offering reimbursement to customers whose flights were called off because of the coronavirus crisis, with carriers citing the agency's stance in response to consumer complaints and analyst questions.

Air Passenger Rights founder Gabor Lukacs says the CTA's statements misled travellers about their right to a refund and contradict the quasi-judicial body's previous decisions.

""If people believe they have no right to a refund, they will just not pursue it,"" he said in an interview.

""This case is about whether a public body can mislead the public without facing some kind of judicial scrutiny.""

Some passengers may not be able to fly in the next two years for health or financial reasons, advocates say. Meanwhile, the airfare they paid amounts to a no-interest loan to airlines.

The pandemic has devastated the airline industry, with billions of dollars in losses for Canadian carriers amid grounded flights and tight international borders.

In contrast to Canadian authorities, the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Transportation have required airlines to refund passengers. The U.S. and European countries including France and Germany have also offered billions in financial relief to struggling carriers, however, while Ottawa has provided no industry-specific bailout to airlines.

Since February, passengers have filed a handful of proposed class-action lawsuits and three petitions garnering more than 109,000 signatures that call for customer reimbursement.

The CTA did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.

In March, the agency said passengers ""should not simply be out-of-pocket for the cost of cancelled flights,"" but also stated that airlines facing a plunge in revenues and customer volumes ""should not be expected to take steps that could threaten their economic viability.""

""The CTA believes that, generally speaking, an appropriate approach in the current context could be for airlines to provide affected passengers with vouchers or credits for future travel, as long as these vouchers or credits do not expire in an unreasonably short period of time (24 months would be considered reasonable in most cases),"" it said on March 25.

The online statement is not an official CTA decision — these are issued periodically on complaints brought before the body — but Lukacs argues it amounts to an unsolicited advance ruling on how the agency will treat passenger complaints, and thus deters them.

Responses by officials in the airline industry and government suggest the post is viewed authoritatively.

On a conference call Friday, Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu told analysts that ""the CTA spoke clearly on the topic, and at this point...I've got no reason to believe that they'll change that.""

Transport Minister Marc Garneau has also framed the online post as an authoritative ruling.

""The Canadian Transportation Agency has ruled on this issue and has ruled that, in the present circumstances and in a non-binding way, it is acceptable for airlines to offer credits for up to two years,"" Garneau told the special all-party COVID-19 committee on May 28.

Customer reimbursement for services that were never rendered is a fundamental principle of consumer protection legislation across multiple provinces, Lukacs said.

The CTA's statement touting travel credit as an alternative has served to ""undermine"" that right, the court submission says, particularly since some credit card and insurance companies have cited the statement as a reason ""to deny policy coverage for actual travel disruptions,"" the court submission says.

The Supreme Court does not automatically hear appeals and instead issues a written decision, usually within one to three months, on whether it will consider a case.

Air Passenger Rights' leave to appeal relates to the Federal Court of Appeal's dismissal of its request for an injunction against the CTA while the case over the travel credits statement is ongoing.

Air Passenger Rights states that the appeal court's test to determine eligibility for such an injunction is too stringent, and could affect not only interprovincial transportation but all areas of federal law, including immigration and refugees, intellectual property law and Indigenous claims.

Staffing across the Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation, which operates the musical and other tourism-related businesses, was reduced 40-60% depending on the area of service, according to Marketing and Communications Director Justin Fisk.
""We tried to use Theodore Roosevelt as guidance,"" he said of the former U.S. president who hunted and ranched in the Badlands in the late 1800s.

It wasn’t a normal venue for the Medora Chamber of Commerce, but the COVID-19 pandemic had reached the United States, and the group needed to remain socially distanced.

""There was great concern at the beginning of the pandemic, at the beginning of our tourist season, how we would reopen the town,"" Chamber of Commerce secretary Anna Killian said. ""I think overall, once the season got going, most of our members would tell you that it’s been a good, smooth season. Visitation is down somewhat, traffic patterns have changed a bit, but we’re a busy little town.""

article continues below

Only one business in town has closed due to COVID-19 -- a store that was entering into only its second year of business, according to Killian.

""A lot of our shops in Medora are small and close-quartered, and while some business owners have taken steps to figure out a way to control traffic flow or limit the amount of people who are in at the same time, this particular store we believe just didn’t have the team members to make it feasible,"" she told The Bismarck Tribune.

The musical

The centerpiece of Medora tourism, the outdoor Medora Musical, was delayed by about a month, opening for the season on June 19.

Staffing across the Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation, which operates the musical and other tourism-related businesses, was reduced 40-60% depending on the area of service, according to Marketing and Communications Director Justin Fisk.

The choice to reduce staffing was made as a result of reduced business hours and services, as well as in anticipation of revenue losses due to fewer visitors, Fisk said.

""We tried to use Theodore Roosevelt as guidance,"" he said of the former U.S. president who hunted and ranched in the Badlands in the late 1800s. ""Do what we can with what we have.""

Reimagining the 2020 musical began in March, Fisk said, ""and changed every day."" The foundation had three main priorities, in order: the musical, the Pitchfork Steak Fondue buffet attraction and the Bully Pulpit Golf Course.

Though the musical’s schedule changed, Fisk said there are only a couple fewer shows than in a normal season. Show capacity sits between 50% and 54% due to COVID-19 measures, and Fisk said most Saturdays are sold at or close to capacity. Special shows such as Kids Night on Wednesdays and Sundays enjoy similar popularity.

""The Medora Musical’s one of the only theatre operations in the country that’s open … and that’s something to be proud of,"" Fisk said.

If the Medora Musical were not open, ""it would have an impact on the community, a negative impact,"" said former mayor Doug Ellison, owner of Amble Inn and Western Edge Books, Artwork and Music, and a current member of the city council.

Golf has seen a 2% increase in business this year, Fisk said, but overall business for the foundation has seen a 40-50% decrease. The sector to take the largest hit has been lodging at 25%, he said, likely because people are taking shorter day trips to minimize outside contact.

One of the major differences from a regular season is that travellers are making shorter-term decisions, Fisk said, which makes it hard to predict what the rest of the season might hold.

However, business has been steadily picking up as the season goes on, Fisk said -- so much so that the foundation was able to hire 30 more employees to begin work in mid-August in the hospitality sector.

The upward growth of visitation as the summer wears on is typical, Fisk said, but he ""can’t say it’s growing faster towards the end of the year than in a normal season.""

Theodore Roosevelt National Park

Medora is at the doorstep of Theodore Roosevelt National Park, which reopened for recreational use May 9 after closing due to pandemic concerns on April 15. Some facilities and all campgrounds remained closed.

Now in the full bloom of the summer season, the park is still closed to overnight campers due to coronavirus-related delays in bathroom and facility upgrades that were scheduled before the pandemic took hold, according to Chief Ranger Grant Geis.

The contractor the park hired from South Dakota to do the work was ""hit really hard"" by the pandemic, he said. There is still no estimated date on when campgrounds will reopen.

Nevertheless, Geis said that since reopening, he has felt the park getting back into the swing of things.

""A normal weekend in Medora is what things kind of look like right now,"" he said.

However, data from the National Park Service shows overall recreational visits are substantially down.

The park saw 60,544 recreational visitors in July 2020, compared to 149,425 in July 2019, a 60% drop. The park saw 93,365 visitors in June 2020, compared to 134,590 in June 2019, a 31% drop.

Geis said some visitors have told him they had planned to visit a different park but came to Theodore Roosevelt when their intended destination was no longer an option.

Though most national parks have now reopened in some capacity, many closed in mid- to late March, earlier than Theodore Roosevelt, and some took longer to reopen in May and June.

Out-of-staters

From what he’s seen, Ellison estimates that the ratio of North Dakotans to out-of-staters this year in his businesses is about 50-50, or ""very similar to other years.""

Fisk said the foundation’s statistics from previous years show that on average, about 60% of visitors to the Medora Musical are from North Dakota. The foundation does not have data yet on the geographical breakdown of this year’s tourists.

Killian, who works full time at the Chateau de Mores State Historic Site, said she has seen a big change in the demographics of visitors this summer.

""Our own data at the Chateau, we had expected to have mostly in-state visitors this year and it is exactly the opposite,"" she said. ""We’ve gotten a lot of out-of-staters. Now, North Dakotans are coming to see us, but it’s that Minnesota and Montana crowd that particularly keep coming through our doors.""

Killian said the chamber has been focusing on upcoming events to bolster out-of-season visitation, when perhaps the pandemic will have ebbed. On Nov. 8, the chamber will host its annual Hunter’s Feed, which she said primarily attracts North Dakotans, and on Dec. 8, it will celebrate its 25th annual Cowboy Christmas.

""We don’t close in the winter, so we want you to know that even with a pandemic, many of our businesses will be open year-round,"" she said. ""So if North Dakotans want to wait until the tourists (thin) out and then come see us, we are here with open arms waiting for you."""

Among the country’s unforgettable experiences is a tour into a dormant volcano. The Thríhnúkagígur volcano, a half-hour drive from Iceland’s capital city Reykjavík, last erupted about 4,000 years ago. When its magma drained out, a cavity big enough to hold the Statue of Liberty remained.

Today, via a pricey six-hour Inside the Volcano tour (which includes three-kilometre hikes to and from the volcano), you can ride a lift through a squeezy opening at the volcano’s top, then 122 metres down into its vast chamber. Inside, lamps bring out the chamber’s pastel colors, and water, seeping through its ceiling, rains down lightly as you explore the bouldery floor.

For a shorter (one-hour) and much cheaper volcanic experience, you can visit Raufarhólshellir, billed as The Lava Tunnel — a 40-minute drive from Reykjavík. This 5,000-year-old lava tube was carved by a river of molten rock that was forced to burrow deeper after its surface had hardened. When the lava drained out, it left behind an extensive tunnel covered in colourful formations.

After passing beneath a few “skylights” where the ceiling had collapsed, you enter the intact lava tube — as big as a railroad tunnel in places. Subtle lighting brings out the tube’s soft colours and fanciful features. At the turnaround point you can experience a few minutes of utter darkness when the guide shuts off the lights.

Above ground, glacier hiking is a quintessential Icelandic experience. About 10% of Iceland is covered by glaciers, and the Sólheimajökull glacier on the South Coast is one of the most accessible.

There, several companies offer excursions of varying lengths and difficulty. A half-day outing with Icelandic Mountain Guides starts with a walk past an iceberg-filled lagoon to the foot of the glacier. Then the guide helps attach spiky crampons to your boots for the climb up spooky-looking canyons of ice and black ash.

Once on top, Sólheimajökull is smoother and whiter. As you crunch across the ice, the guide explains how the glacier moves, where those mysterious cones of black ash come from, how gaping sinkholes appear, and how climate change is melting the ice so rapidly that Sólheimajökull could disappear within a century.

Even on regular land, Iceland is a wonderland for hikers. Tórsmörk — “Thor’s Woods” — is a top destination, with well-marked trails leading to thrilling views over volcanoes, glaciers, and valleys.

Since it’s accessible only on gravel roads that require fording rushing rivers and streams, most visitors get there aboard specially equipped, jacked-up buses.

The main reason to visit Tórsmörk is the glorious hike to the top of Valahnúkur mountain. Starting from the visitors complex in Húsadalur Valley, the hike to the summit is less than two kilometres, but it’s staircase-steep in stretches and gains 275 metres in elevation.

On top, your sweat earns you a commanding view of three glacier-topped volcanoes, including the notorious Eyjafjallajökull, whose 2010 eruptions choked European air travel. Far below, the wide Markárfljót river valley sprawls to your north and the Krossá river valley to the south, their glacier-fed torrents rushing toward the sea.

For those who prefer that someone else do the hiking, horseback riding in Iceland is a special experience.

The descendants of ponies brought here by Viking settlers, Icelandic horses are small, strong and docile.

They’re renowned for their five gaits: Along with walk, trot and gallop, they have two extra “gears” — the tölt, which is fast and extremely smooth, and the high-speed “flying pace.”

A whale-watching cruise offers a more leisurely experience and a chance to spy the elusive whales of the North Atlantic. You can expect to see dolphins, porpoises and midsize minke whales (seen on local menus) rather than big humpback or blue whales.

Several tours depart from Reykjavík, but locals say the best whale-watching is in North Iceland, from the towns of Húsavík and Akureyri.

For all its ruggedness, Iceland also has its comforts — an abundance of thermal baths heated by the island’s geothermal energy. From touristy “premium” baths such as the Blue Lagoon to municipal pools favoured by locals, a thermal bath is only a short drive. Imagine wrapping up a vigorous day of exploring Iceland’s magnificent outdoors with a soothing soak in 38 C water. Aaaaahhh!

From volcano chamber explorations to geothermal pool plunges, Iceland offers adventures and activities that you can’t easily do anywhere else.

""I believe that giving Bus 142 a long-term home in Fairbanks at the UA Museum of the North can help preserve and tell the stories of all these people,"" Feige said.","ANCHORAGE, Alaska — An infamous bus appears headed to a new home at a museum in Fairbanks after being removed from Alaska’s backcountry to deter people from making dangerous, sometimes deadly treks to visit the site where a young man documented his demise in 1992.

The state Department of Natural Resources said Thursday that it intends to negotiate with the University of Alaska’s Museum of the North to display the bus, which was popularized by the book ""Into the Wild"" and a movie of the same name and flown from its location near Denali National Park and Preserve last month.

""Of the many expressions of interest in the bus, the proposal from the UA Museum of the North best met the conditions we at DNR had established to ensure this historical and cultural object will be preserved in a safe location where the public could experience it fully, yet safely and respectfully, and without the spectre of profiteering,"" Natural Resources Commissioner Corri Feige said in a statement.

The bus became a beacon for those wishing to retrace the steps of Christopher McCandless, who hiked to the bus in 1992. The 24-year-old Virginia man died from starvation when he couldn’t hike back out because of the swollen Teklanika River. He kept a journal of his ordeal, which was discovered when his body was found.

McCandless’ story became famous with author Jon Krakauer’s 1996 book ""Into the Wild,"" followed nine years later by director Sean Penn’s movie of the same name.

Over the years, people from around the world have travelled to the bus, located about 25 miles (40 kilometres) from the town of Healy, to pay homage to McCandless.

Two women have drowned in the Teklanika River on such visits to the bus, one from Switzerland in 2010 and the other from Belarus nine years later. There have been 15 other search-and-rescue missions since 2009, state officials said, including five Italian tourists who needed rescue last winter. One had severe frostbite.

The draw of the bus became too much for state officials, who arranged for the Alaska Army National Guard to remove the bus with a helicopter last month as part of a training mission.

The former Fairbanks city bus is sometimes called Bus 142 or the Magic Bus. It was later used to house construction workers building a road in the area. It was abandoned in 1961, and became a shelter for those using the backcountry to recreate or hunt.

The department received dozens of suggestions for use of the bus that came from individuals, museums and institutions nationwide, with varying plans to preserve, exhibit, monetize or memorialize it, Feige said.

The department decided to consider the university’s proposal, which had several advantages. It’s just one of three official state repositories, and the only one in the Fairbanks area able to accept and curate state-owned historical items. The museum also has the staff to restore, curate and display the bus.

This proposal also allows the Department of Natural Resources to retain ownership of the bus, and decide future uses, including whether to lend it out for display and where.

""I believe that giving Bus 142 a long-term home in Fairbanks at the UA Museum of the North can help preserve and tell the stories of all these people,"" Feige said. ""It can honour all of the lives and dreams, as well as the deaths and sorrows associated with the bus, and do so with respect and dignity.""

The department anticipates signing final paperwork within the next few months."

The only routes out of western gateways between Nov. 1 and April 30 will be from Vancouver to Toronto and Montreal, as well as some connecting flights to Europe via Toronto.

Would-be passengers will automatically receive a full refund rather than the company credit that has previously been offered for flights cancelled due to the COVID-19 crisis, Transat said.

""Since the current situation does not allow us to foresee resuming routes from Western Canada in the near future and there will therefore be no direct flight options to use vouchers with Air Transat from their location, customers impacted by cancellations resulting from this suspension will receive a refund in the amount on file,"" Transat spokeswoman Marie-Christine Pouliot said in an email.

""For other locations, where more options exist, we have offered more flexibility by relaxing our travel credit policy. They are now fully transferable and have no expiry date.""

Transat cited ""the many challenges"" facing the airline industry, which revolve around a pandemic that shut down borders and grounded fleets before traffic slowly starting to pick up in the summer, though not enough to revive the critical crossborder tourism or business travel markets. The Montreal-based carrier's first flight in four months took off last week.

Transat and other Canadian airlines have refused to reimburse most customers whose flights were cancelled as a result of the coronavirus.

Transat, Air Canada and WestJet Airlines Ltd. have all said their stance on refunds aligns with federal regulations and guidance posted over the past five months by the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA).

Legal precedent, contract law suggest that's not the case, said passenger rights advocate Gabor Lukacs, noting ""the universal principal across Canada"" that customers should be reimbursed for services never rendered.

""Air Transat must refund all passengers whose flights were cancelled, regardless of their point of departure or the reason for the cancellation,"" Lukacs said, citing a CTA decision from 2004 concerning Transat as well as the carrier's own contract of carriage.

The company's crossborder tariff — a contract between airline and passenger — states that Transat ""will refund the unused ticket"" in the event of overbooking or cancellation by the airline.

Air Canada quietly changed its refund policy in June to allow some customers with cancelled flight tickets to recoup their cash — but not passengers whose trips originated in Canada.

Travellers with flights originating in the European Union, Switzerland or Iceland are entitled to receive a refund, the airline said, but passengers who were slated to fly one-way or round-trip from Canada to Europe are not.

WestJet changed its policy to reimburse customers on flights between the U.S. and Canada that were cancelled due to COVID-19 after ""carefully monitoring the regulatory frameworks"" across jurisdictions.

The country's three biggest airlines have cancelled tens of thousands of flights since late March. Air Canada saw capacity dip by 95 per cent in the spring after it lost more than $1 billion in the first quarter and projects passenger levels will not return to 2019 levels for at least three years.

Transat told The Canadian Press last week it will delay the closing deadline of its takeover by Air Canada, pushing it back by one month until Aug. 27 as European regulators and federal cabinet members mull how the $720-million acquisition will affect competition.

The report by the Themed Entertainment Association and the Economics Practice at AECOM said that overall attendance at the 10 biggest theme park operators in the world grew by 4% last year and climbed to 521 million visits, according to the report.

The report only looked at attendance in 2019 and didn't take into account the disruptions in the industry this year caused by the spreading coronavirus, which forced parks to close for months at a time. Parks that have reopened are operating with limits on attendance so guests can maintain social distancing. Attendance at the parks could be anywhere from a third to half of normal business volume, according to the report.

""However, it may take one to several years to return to pre-COVID operating levels, and the investment horizon of many owners may be altered due to cash flow loss,"" the report said.

Attendance at Disney theme parks around the world fell less than 1% in 2019 from the previous year. Disney is the largest theme park operator in the world by attendance.

Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida kept its title as the world's most visited park last year, with 20.9 million visits, a half per cent increase over the previous year. It was followed by Disneyland in California with 18.6 million visits, Tokyo Disneyland with 17.9 million visits and Tokyo DisneySea. All of those parks were flat from the previous year.

The flat attendance is likely due to an effort by Disney to limit entry, while charging higher prices, so that visitors have a more enjoyable experience, though in Hong Kong, a 15% drop was the result of tourism disruptions caused by protests for political reforms, the report said.

Competing in many of the same markets as Disney, Universal Parks and Resorts had an attendance jump of 2.3%, with 51.2 million visits. Most of that growth came from Universal's Islands of Adventure in Florida where attendance grew by 6%, powered by the addition of the Harry Potter-themed steel coaster, Hagrid’s Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure.

Rides based on Harry Potter intellectual property continued to drive growth at the Universal parks, the report said.

Among domestic U.S. operators, Cedar Fair Entertainment Co. had the strongest growth, with a 7.8% jump in attendance, driven by investments in new rides.

Chinese operators grew rapidly in 2019, with attendance at parks owned by the Fantawild Group increasing by 19.8% and visits at parks owned by Oct Group growing by 9.4%.

The report noted that the theme park industry has survived disruptions in the past over health and security concerns.

""While acknowledging the serious nature and consequences of the current pandemic, history shows us that people’s behaviour, with some exceptions, largely returns to normal once the threat is removed,"" the report said.

On the one hand, the lack of crowds means more opportunities to go on rides without long waits. On the other hand, Connecticut and Florida have implemented pandemic-related quarantines for each other's residents and visitors, and the Barkers worry whether the Disney ""magic"" will get lost with mandatory mask-wearing for visitors and workers, temperature checks and no parades, fireworks shows or up-close ""meet-and-greets"" with costumed characters.

article continues below

""We keep going back and forth. It's such a hard decision to make,"" Barker said last Tuesday.

Two weeks after Disney World started opening its theme parks for the first time since closing in March because of COVID-19, the Barkers' quandary affects not only Disney World's future but that of central Florida's tourism-reliant economy.

More than 75 million visitors came to Orlando in 2018, mostly due to its reputation as a theme park mecca, which also includes Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando. But the coronavirus has upended Orlando's status as the most visited place in the U.S.

In the week that Disney World's Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom started welcoming back visitors, occupancy of hotel rooms in the Orlando area was down more than 60% from the previous year, a much deeper drop than the state as a whole, which declined more than 41%, according to STR, which tracks hotel data.

Less than half of Disney World's 43,000 unionized workers have been recalled to their old jobs, contributing to two Orlando-area counties having the state's highest unemployment rates last month — Osceola at 22.9% and Orange at 17.2%. Disney World has an overall workforce of 77,000 employees, the nation's largest single-site labour force.

Many of those still-furloughed workers are about to lose federal benefits at the end of the month.

""This is an extremely difficult moment,"" said Paul Cox, president of the local union that represents stagehands and show technicians at Disney World. ""There are still a majority of workers who are staying at home and they’re about to lose support. Things are going to get bad.""

Union officials estimate the Disney parks are no more than a third full, but that may be more by design to maintain social distancing. Disney World doesn't release attendance figures, but in pre-pandemic times its four parks and two water parks could host around 150,000 visitors a day.

Florida has had a surging coronavirus caseload recently, and other Disney parks around the globe have run into coronavirus-related roadblocks. Hong Kong Disneyland Park was forced to close earlier this month following the city’s decision to ban public gatherings of more than four people, and Disney's California parks delayed reopening while they awaited state guidelines.

Cowen Inc. estimated recently that Disney's parks and resorts won't return to pre-pandemic profitability until fiscal year 2025, and there is a ""meaningful"" probability that Disney World could close again because of the pandemic.

Leaders of the Disney World workers' unions describe the virus-related safety measures Disney has taken as ""exemplary.""

After workers complained about patrons walking around with their masks pulled down while eating food like turkey legs, Disney World updated its mandatory mask policy, requiring visitors to eat in one place while maintaining social distancing.

In response to other worker concerns, Disney has distributed personal hand sanitizer containers for workers to wear on their belts, added additional break rooms to limit the number of workers in them and reduced the number of riders on buses that shuttle workers from parking lots to the parks. Performers dressed as Disney princesses being driven in a horse-powered carriage through the parks now sit individually in rows separated by clear-plastic window partitions.

""Singing their praises seems so strange,"" said Julee Jerkovich, an official with a United Food & Commercial Workers union, which represents Disney merchandise and banquet workers. ""As far as this grand experiment, I would have to say Disney has done a really good job.""

But not all unions are happy. The union that represents actors and singers has filed a grievance with Disney World, saying their 750 members were locked out of returning to work after they complained about Disney ignoring their demands for getting coronavirus tests since they can’t wear masks while performing. Some performers, though, are eager to return to work and are pushing the union to reach an agreement with the company, as they worry about Disney replacing their shows with temporary ones featuring non-actors.

Actor's Equity Association fired a new salvo against Disney over the weekend by tweeting a re-edited version of a welcome-back video produced by the company featuring workers preparing the park for visitors. In Equity’s version, a rolling count of Florida’s coronavirus cases runs on the screen.

There have been isolated cases of workers and visitors connected to the theme parks getting sick with COVID-19, ""but we haven’t seen any large number of positive cases that come from any of the parks,"" Dr. Raul Pino, health officer for Florida's Department of Health, said last Monday.

Disney's policy of granting sick workers with paid time off so they can quarantine has made a difference, said Eric Clinton, president of Unite Here! Local 362, which represents Disney World park greeters, attractions workers and custodians.

But Clinton wonders if the current operating model can last until the pandemic is over, given that just over 20,000 of the 43,000 workers represented by unions have returned to work, only half of Disney World's 30 onsite hotels currently are back open and several in-park restaurants still are closed.

""Disney is a strong brand. They have a great product, but does the novelty wear off? Do people want to go to a theme park now? Is it more appealing with less crowds?"" Clinton said. ""I’m hopeful but nervous.""

Here’s a reminder of the fun that awaits us in Europe at the other end of this crisis.

I love exploring the world of ancient Rome, with its grand architecture, fascinating culture, and stories of larger-than-life leaders. But since many of the 2,000-year-old empire’s landmarks are reduced to ruins, it can be hard to make sense of the stones and rubble left behind.

To get a clearer picture of what everyday life in ancient Rome was really like, visit the well-preserved (and unlucky) city of Pompeii. Located just south of Naples, Pompeii was founded in 600 BC and eventually grew from its Greek and Etruscan roots into a bustling Roman trading city and port.

Neither rich nor poor, Pompeii was a typical middle-class town. To serve its 20,000 residents, the city boasted more than 40 bakeries, 130 bars, and plenty of public baths. Being a port, it also had brothels, restaurants, and entertainment venues that catered to sailors from all over the Roman world — many of whom didn’t speak a lick of Latin. Most of Pompeii’s buildings were covered in brilliant white ground-marble stucco, making it an impressive sight. And from its richly decorated forum, people had a postcard-perfect view of the looming volcano, Mount Vesuvius.

Then on Aug. 24, AD 79, everything changed. At about 1 p.m., Vesuvius sent a mushroom cloud of ash, dust, and rocks 20 kilometres into the sky. It spewed for 18 hours straight, as winds blew the cloud south toward the city. The white-grey ash settled like a heavy snow on Pompeii, its weight eventually collapsing roofs and floors (but leaving walls standing). Though most of Pompeii’s residents fled, 2,000 stayed behind.

A bad move, because the next morning a red-hot pyroclastic flow struck Pompeii, dealing a fatal blow to those who had remained, and burying the city under nine metres of volcanic ash.

After the eruption, people from nearby towns tried in vain to find the buried city. Because Pompeii was a major port, people naturally searched for it near the sea. But the eruption had filled in the harbour and pushed the coastline out, meaning Pompeii now lay inland — and its location would remain a mystery for more than 1,500 years.

In 1599, Pompeii was accidentally rediscovered during construction of a canal. Serious excavations began in 1748 and are still ongoing, making Pompeii the longest-continually-excavated site in the world.

Ironically, the ash that had destroyed Pompeii also ensured its preservation, leaving it frozen in time. As a result, its ruins offer the best look anywhere at life in an ancient Roman town, with its gridded street plan, villas and homes, commercial buildings, public baths, and colourful frescoes left remarkably intact.

Pompeii also exhibits small signs of everyday life. In the town’s many “fast food” joints, holes in the counter show where containers once held food for hungry customers to grab as a quick meal. Public drinking fountains still stand along the city’s main streets, many of which would have been lined with stalls and jammed with customers from sunup to sundown. And if you look closely at some of the walls, bright red graffiti pops out exclaiming that Julius was here.

Of course, the most compelling scenes in Pompeii are provided by its (permanent) residents. While excavating, modern archeologists detected hollow spaces in the volcanic debris that were created when victims’ bodies decomposed. By gently filling in the holes with plaster, the archeologists created molds of the Pompeiians who were caught in the disaster. The plaster casts show remarkable details — the folds of togas, the straps of sandals, the pained expressions on victims’ faces. Signs of animals have also been found, including a saddled-up horse that appears ready to carry its master to safety.

To complement your Pompeii visit, stop by the National Archaeological Museum in Naples. The museum is home to Pompeii’s finest art and artifacts, including a display (in the “Secret Room”) of erotic frescoes that were considered so bawdy that by the time they made it here, in 1819, they could be viewed only with permission from the king. (From Naples, Pompeii is easily reached via a CitySightseeing bus or the handy — but shabby — Circumvesuviana commuter train.)

Excavations at Pompeii experienced a renaissance in 2018, when new artifacts and skeletons were discovered in a section of the city yet to be fully unearthed. With fresh secrets sure to be revealed over time, evocative Pompeii will be worth visiting again and again.

But the mayor of Gaspe, Que., a popular tourist destination on the Gaspe peninsula's eastern coast, is concerned some visitors are camping anywhere they find space, harming the environment and upsetting locals.

""We're seeing a lot of tents on public beaches, in forests, on private land without the approval of the owners of that land,"" Mayor Daniel Cote said in an interview Thursday.

Cote said he had high hopes tourists would come to the Gaspe this summer despite the pandemic. Authorities had closed off the region to outsiders earlier this year to stop the spread of COVID-19.

But Cote said he was caught off guard by the number of tourists who arrived without hotel or camping reservations. ""People invaded public beaches and decided that that's where they would set up camp,"" he said.

A series of photos posted on Facebook Wednesday showed tents and camping chairs lined up along a beach, as well as empty beer cans and other garbage littering the sand. The Canadian Press could not independently verify the photos, which purportedly were taken at Haldimand Beach in Gaspe.

The post was shared nearly 600 times as of Thursday afternoon and garnered over 300 comments, many of which criticize the tourists and demand the town take action. Cote said public beaches are under provincial authority, so the municipality has limited means to intervene.

But he said Gaspe intends to hire people to patrol busy public areas and inform visitors of the rules, which include a ban on driving vehicles on public beaches and to safely dispose trash.

The town is also working with Quebec provincial police and the nearby Mi'kmaq Nation of Gespeg to protect the area, Cote added. ""As a municipality we don't have coercive power to force people to leave the areas ... so we're going to go with raising awareness.""

In a statement Thursday, officials with the Mi'kmaq Nation of Gespeg said unregulated camping in the area had gotten ""out of control"" and was negatively affecting local wildlife and ecosystems.

""On the beaches, washed up wood, which is important for slowing erosion, is being burned without knowledge of its consequences,"" the statement reads. ""Migratory birds are being disturbed on their nesting grounds. We cannot even keep track of the amount of waste that litters the waters, the beaches, the parking lots, and rest areas.""

The regional public health authority launched an awareness campaign this month to prevent the potential spread of COVID-19 in the Gaspe region amid the wave of tourists.

Small teams are being deployed across the region to make sure people are respecting public health guidelines, explained Clemence Beaulieu-Gendron, a spokeswoman for CISSS de la Gaspesie. She said several local mayors have asked the public health teams to come to their towns.

So far, a team of four outreach workers is working in the area of Sainte-Anne-des-Monts, on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River, while others have been sent to Gaspe, Perce, and Carleton-sur-Mer.

""They're not police. It's important to say that,"" Beaulieu-Gendron said about the workers, in an interview. ""It's really to raise awareness to avoid a second wave, or in any case, to decrease the risk of spreading the virus in the region during summer vacation.""

Lily Gang, the owner of Motel-Camping Fort Ramsay in Gaspe, said this summer seems just as busy as in past years. Her business counts 32 motel rooms and 42 camp sites, which normally can accommodate both trailers and tents.

But Gang said she chose not to take any reservations for tent camping this year because she felt uneasy with clients using the communal restrooms and showers during the COVID-19 pandemic. She said she also feared campers could put her cleaning staff at risk.

""I don't know how to handle so many people together,"" Gang said in an interview.

Cote said the region typically receives 800,000 visitors every summer, but this year he expects more. He said he intends to speak to the provincial government this fall to make sure the public beaches aren't overrun again next year.

In the meantime, he encouraged tourists to plan their trips to the region ahead of time — and only visit if they have reservations. ""It will make us very happy to welcome you, as long as you behave respectfully towards people in the area.""

Surrounded by the ocean, views of neighbouring mountains, bountiful forests, beautiful rivers and falls, and places of wonderful solitude. What it has lacked is a multi-day, inn-to-inn trail that brings this all together in one long-distance hike. Until now.

With the opening of the Sooke Hills Wilderness Trail in the summer of 2017, it is now possible to hike from the Mount Wells parking area in Langford to the town of Lake Cowichan over three days — all on trails — and all without needing a car to get back to Victoria.

The first day, over the Sooke Hills Wilderness Trail with its amazing views from the Malahat, ends at a B&B halfway up the west side of Shawnigan Lake.

The second day, up the Cowichan Valley Trail and over the Kinsol Trestle, ends in Duncan.

The third day, partly along the Cowichan River and with more amazing views, ends in Lake Cowichan. The return from Lake Cowichan to Victoria can be done that same evening or the next morning via a combination of B.C. Transit and the Tofino Bus.

The three legs of the hike range from 25 to 28 kilometres. The first day is the most challenging, with a long and relatively steep ascent, followed by a long stretch of undulating trail.

The second and third days are easier, mostly following old rail tracks (except a few optional but desirable stretches by the Cowichan River on the third day).

Because breakfast and dinner are available at all locations, hikers need only carry the clothes they will need for the three days, some food for lunch and water — so backpack weight is manageable (unlike, say, Cheryl Strayed’s “Monster” from her book Wild).

This hike is certainly challenging and shouldn’t be done without reasonably good conditioning, but the rewards are amazing. The hike winds its way through some of the finest scenery that Vancouver Island has to offer and provides all sorts of time to unwind and enjoy nature.

I did this hike on my own (in late January) and met no more than 10 people on the trail during the entire trip.

If you seek solitude, then this hike is for you. The only sounds I heard were the wind through the trees, birds and rushing waters. Well, I also heard the sounds of logging at times, but accepted this as one of the reasons that some forest trails even exist.

While long-distance walking is a novelty for many Canadians, it has long been popular in Europe: Miles of established paths criss-cross the continent, and in England, they are often clearly marked and cared for. If a path unravels across a farm, the farmer is the caretaker of that expanse. Many enthusiasts belong to the Long Distance Walkers Association, based in England. Founded in 1972, the association is a clearinghouse for information and organizes long-distance walks.

Long-distance walkers aren’t necessarily campers. Even when they do go on adventurous multi-day excursions, they’re just as likely to spend the night at a bed and breakfast where they can take a shower and have a beer. There are even businesses that will carry your gear for you. Long-distance walkers go solo, but they also go in groups.

The wonderful thing about long-distance walking is that there’s a low barrier of entry. It is not as physically daunting as, say, running a marathon. But it is, of course, hard work. After a number of kilometres, one’s feet can definitely start aching.

Blisters are often the bane of the long-distance walker. Several threads on the association’s forums are devoted to how best to combat, treat and drain blisters. Methods discussed include an absorbing plaster called “Compeed,” duct tape, and immersing sweaty feet in a bag of corn flour. But the bodily toll is worth it!

Studies have shown that long-distance walking can facilitate relief and disengagement from common stresses and problems in life and can help people find ways to resolve their issues. Moreover, long-distance walking can build confidence and a sense of purpose and provide opportunities for reflection. Studies also show that “forest bathing,” a practice that originated in Japan in the late 1980s, increases immunity, decreases the risk of cancer and helps you to recover from illness faster.

Keep all this in mind as you contemplate the hike, day by day.

Day 1: Langford to Shawnigan Lake

The hike begins at the Mount Wells parking lot on Humpback Road. B.C. Transit (Route 65 from downtown Victoria) will get you about 1.5 kilometres — a 20-minute walk — from the trailhead. The other alternative is to take a cab.

The first 2.5 kilometres of the trail are beautiful, passing the Waugh Creek Falls and crossing the Goldstream River Suspension Bridge. At 2.5 kilometres, the trail passes a gate and becomes a service road (for the Victoria watershed) and climbs steadily for the next seven kilometres. At 9.5 kilometres, the service road ends at another gate and morphs back into a true trail.

For the next four kilometres, which are the highest elevations for the trail, there are great views of Mount Baker to the east and the Olympic mountains to the south. The last kilometre of this stretch is a wonderful piece of single-track trail through a forest up to Stebbings Road.

Now you are on the Cowichan Valley Trail, dropping down into a forest, often running by a creek, crossing the lovely little Shawnigan Creek Bridge at the 20-kilometre mark. This stretch ends at Sooke Lake Road at the 22-kilometre mark.

From here, it is a flat six kilometres, with glimpses of Shawnigan Lake to the east, to the night’s destination — the delightful Stonekroft Guest House (just east of the trail, across Shawnigan Lake Road at 2021 Marble Rd.).

Day 2: Shawnigan Lake to Duncan

Resuming the trail where you left it the day before, cross the small McGee Trestle at the two-kilometre mark and the magnificent and historic Kinsol Trestle at the 9.5-kilometre mark.

In contrast to the first day, the trail on the second day is generally flat, with more wide-open vistas.

About the 21.5-kilometre mark (about four kilometres west of Duncan and 200 metres after crossing Shawnigan Road), there is a small trail branching off the right/east toward Duncan, the night’s destination. This trail ends after about three kilometres at Glenora Road.

From there, it is another one or two kilometres on roads to Duncan, where there are several accommodation options (I stayed at McLay Guest House).

Day 3: Duncan to Lake Cowichan

Rather than retracing your steps to the fork in the trail west of Duncan (which makes for a very long day of more than 30 kilometres), take a taxi from Duncan to the Glenora Trails Head Park (which shaves eight kilometres off the day’s hike). From that point, it is about 25 kilometres to Lake Cowichan, including time spent on some of the smaller trails running beside the Cowichan River.

The trail crosses the Holt Creek Trestle, the 64.4 Mile Trestle, the 66 Mile Trestle and the 70.2 Mile Trestle.

Highlights of the day include the five kilometres of trail by the Cowichan River just past the Holt Creek Trestle (there is a sign for this just past the trestle, where a small trail branches off to the right and initially follows Holt Creek) and the North Side trail that is accessed just past 66 Mile Trestle (on the left-hand side).

The latter trail takes you along spectacular bluff tops high above the river, until the Horseshoe Bend Group Campground, at which point the trail becomes more bucolic and travels alongside the river until reaching Skutz Falls.

From there, the trail is relatively flat and straight, eventually spilling out in Lake Cowichan, where there are several options for accommodation if you want to overnight before heading back to Victoria.

The details

What to bring

Definitely look at the weather forecast to determine clothing needs. Smartwool tops are great because they can go several days without needing to be washed. Bring a change of clothes to relax in during the evenings.

For food, bring some energy bars for snacks and lunches for Day 1 and Day 2 (lunch for Day 3 can be bought in Duncan).

Depending on the temperature, plan to bring two to three litres of water each day (there are no places to pick up water during the day).

A 25- to 30-litre backpack should be fine to carry clothes, water and food.

Hiking poles aren’t really needed — the trail is not technical except for some mildly technical stretches alongside the Cowichan River.

For the same reason, hiking shoes aren’t really required — running shoes will suffice for the most part (though hiking shoes will keep feet warmer in winter).

Where to stay

Following Day 1, the only option is the Stonekroft Guest House, which is just off Shawnigan Lake at 2021 Marble Rd. The hosts, Jude and Tom, are very considerate and make a wonderful breakfast.

Dinner at the end of Day 1 can be obtained from Sarpino’s Pizzeria, which will deliver to Stonekroft and which makes great pizza (there are no restaurants within walking distance of the Stonekroft).

Following Day 2, there are several accommodation options in Duncan. There are places in southwest Duncan that are closer to the trail, but it is still necessary to walk into town for dinner and to buy provisions for lunch on Day 3.

Following Day 3, there is accommodation in Lake Cowichan or the possibility of returning to Victoria by bus.

Transportation

The Mount Wells parking lot, the start of the trail, can be accessed by taking a cab or by B.C. Transit (the nearest stop, on Route 65, is about 1.5 kilometres from the trailhead).

From Lake Cowichan, the end of the trail, there is a B.C. Transit bus (Route 7) to Duncan.

From Duncan, Tofino Bus travels to downtown Victoria. However, while the Tofino Bus runs that route daily, its only evening runs are on Fridays and Sundays.

If you are arriving in Lake Cowichan on any other day, it is necessary to overnight there and then take the Tofino bus from Duncan the next morning.

When to go

With the right clothing and footwear, this hike can be done year-round (except after heavy snowfalls). The trail will generally not get too muddy in the rain (except the branch trails running by the Cowichan River).

Which direction to go

Either direction is possible, but the advantage of south to north is that it will mean not walking into the sun.

Longer and shorter alternatives

This can be shortened to a two-day hike by either ending in Duncan or by doing an out-and-back to Shawnigan Lake. Alternatively, it can be made a four-day hike by hiking back from Lake Cowichan to Duncan.

Alone or with others?

Hiking long-distance trails on your own can provide the opportunity to enjoy the sounds of nature, go at your own pace and better reflect and meditate. On the other hand, hiking with others provides the opportunity to share a wonderful experience and can help the time go by faster.

Maps

While the trail is well marked and maps aren’t really required, the following maps are useful:

• Sooke Hills Wilderness Regional Park Map

• Cowichan Valley Trail, Malahat Connector Map

• Cowichan Valley Trail Map

• Cowichan River Provincial Park Map (particularly good for noting the trails leaving the main trail to go by the Cowichan River)

It is also a good idea to bring a smartphone, which can be used to determine where you are on the trail (though cell coverage is spotty in some areas) and to provide maps of Duncan and Lake Cowichan.

Ken Armour is an avid hiker and has hiked numerous long-distance trails in England and Switzerland, including the Tour du Mont Blanc. This spring, he is planning to hike the Great Glen Way in Scotland and the Northumberland Coast Path in northeastern England. When not hiking on trails, Ken also enjoys trail running and the many trail races in the Victoria region. Ken works at the B.C.

Park at the Elk River Trailhead.","Cradled below towering mountains at the centre of Vancouver Island is a lake whose name tells the landscape's history.

Landslide Lake caught the face of one the Island's tallest mountains when a magnitude-7.3 earthquake shook it loose in 1946.

""The northeast slope of (Mount) Colonel Foster fractured off and fell into the lake. And the lake subsequently had a tsunami, or a big wave, that hurdled down the whole valley and took a whole bunch of trees or vegetation with it,"" said Marlene Smith, co-founder of Friends of Strathcona Park.

Today, hikers can climb up the smooth rock face left by the wave's path to reach the lake's icy, teal waters.

Vancouver Island is well known for its coastal trails, but the alpine peaks and mountain valleys at its centre are also lined with day and overnight hikes in Strathcona Park, British Columbia's oldest provincial park.

The journey to Landslide Lake begins at the Elk River Trailhead off Highway 28, between Campbell River and Gold River.

Hikers can stop at the nearby volunteer-run Strathcona Wilderness Institute for information about the park.

While experienced hikers can do the 26-kilometre round trip hike in about nine hours, Smith recommends packing a tent and making it an overnight adventure. An average hiker will take four to six hours to reach the campsite, which is another hour or two from the lake.

""It's a beautiful trail, which is hikeable for almost all ages, although you have to be reasonably fit, because it's quite long,"" Smith said.

From the trailhead, a wide path meanders through old-growth stands of Douglas fir, hemlock and cedar. The toughest parts of the trek are its first and last sections, with a total elevation rise of 600 metres.

The trail mostly parallels Elk River, which is prone to gush when there's too much rain, snow or glacial melt. There is also an avalanche risk in winter and early spring.

That makes July and August — the driest months — best for a visit, although hikers often make their way through between late spring and early fall.

""Bridges and parts of the trail are prone to flood, so I always recommend people check to make sure it is not flooded, but accessible,"" Smith said.

Matthew Lettington, president of Island Mountain Ramblers, also warned hikers to plan their trips before they start, since cellular and satellite reception is spotty in the park.

He first visited the trail about eight years ago.

""I was surprised how deep between the mountains we were. There are sections in there, still, where we'll lose our GPS signals because the mountains are so tall. It's called a 'box canyon,'"" Lettington said.

For those interested in extending the adventure, a more rugged trail along the eastern edge of Landslide Lake leads to another turquoise, glacial lake known colloquially as Berg Lake.

Little icebergs may float at the surface or it may be frozen over, depending on the time of year.

Ice caves also form along its edge, but enter at your own risk, as they're prone to collapse.

""Those aren't there every year. Sometimes you have heavy, heavy snow and hard winters that persist into September. Other years, there may be no snow accumulated in those place, so it's always changing,"" Lettington said.

“Thursday’s ceremony was a huge milestone for the project,” said Ken Milbrath, president of the Vancouver Island Trail Association, who is overseeing the trail’s creation.

The association, formed in 2009, has been steadily linking existing backcountry hiking routes through public land. The trail winds through forests as well as rugged coastlines.

Only 140 kilometres of trail, all sitting in private land owned by two forest companies, remain to be added to complete it.

The main blockade is two sections around Cowichan Lake and Port Alberni. The two sections — essentially old logging roads — have been closed to public access over concerns regarding liability.

With regional governments signalling that they would be open to classifying the trail as an easement, the last sections could join the trail in “a couple of years,” Milbrath said.

“When complete, the Vancouver Island Trail has the potential to become an economic driver for the region.”

Liz Bicknell, president of the Outdoor Club of Victoria, agrees.

“The opening of the trail can be a boon for smaller communities that are now just dependent on the forestry industry,” said Bicknell, who is also the fundraising director for the Vancouver Island Trail Association.

“Hikers will need food, accommodation and other ancillary businesses so vital for smaller communities.”

A hike along the trail in its entirety would take between two to three months; Milbrath said people are already taking day trips and overnight trips on existing portions of the trail.

One of the most famous hiking routes is the Camino de Santiago, which is nearly 800 kilometres in length. The path, an UNESCO World Heritage Site, was once used by pilgrims to visit a religious shrine in Spain.

“I like to tell people that a trip along the Vancouver Island Trail is no less spectacular, with hikers encountering 49 separate First Nations along the way,” Milbrath said. “All have different history of art, culture and language to tell.”

The opening will be followed up with the planned erection of a kiosk in Anderson Hill Park, with plaques giving information on the trail.

The society is accepting donations to help cover the cost of trail construction.

Breton said the additional provincial rebate makes buying electric cars more attractive in Quebec and B.C.
Transport Minister Marc Garneau was instructed in his mandate letter to do more to make the electric car sales quotas.
Before the pandemic, he indicated he was looking at what more to do, including extending or expanding the rebate program.
Garneau's spokeswoman was noncommittal Thursday when asked if the rebate program would be expanded.","OTTAWA — Electric car advocates are pushing Ottawa to put more money into its zero-emission vehicle rebate program, as the popular program is on track to run out of cash more than a year ahead of schedule.

Transport Canada data obtained by The Canadian Press this week shows 75 per cent of the $300-million program has already been spoken for, just 15 months into its three-year mandate.

article continues below

The rebate, which provides up to $5,000 back on the purchase or lease of a new battery vehicle, or a battery-gasoline hybrid one, began May 1, 2019, and was supposed to run until April 30, 2022.

But as of July 31, more than $225 million had been paid out to 53,510 drivers.

""It's no surprise to me,"" said Daniel Breton, president of Electric Mobility Canada, a non-profit agency pushing for the electrification of transportation.

Electric car sales, as a share of overall vehicle purchases, have steadily grown from two per cent of all sales in 2018 to three per cent last year, and to almost four per cent in the first three months of 2020.

But the rate of uptake is heavily concentrated in just three provinces. Quebec and British Columbia, which have sales quotas for electric cars and provincial rebates on top of the federal one, together account for 86 per cent of all the rebates.

Ontario, which had a provincial rebate until 2019, accounted for another 12 per cent, with the remaining two per cent divided among the other seven provinces and the territories.

Breton said the additional provincial rebate makes buying electric cars more attractive in Quebec and B.C. but car makers are also shipping more electric cars there because their dealers have quotas for sales. Availability of electric models is limited, and many drivers have to wait weeks or months for one.

Electric Mobility Canada wants Ottawa to expand the program to include used cars and to increase the maximum purchase price of the cars that qualify for a rebate. SUVs and pickup trucks, which are more expensive, are set to come onto the market. In 2019, almost three in every four passenger vehicles sold were SUVs and pickups.

Cara Clairman, CEO of the non-profit advocacy group Plug'n Drive, says she hopes Ottawa will provide more money for rebates when the current allotment runs out because they are making a difference.

""I think we do need a few more years of it,"" she said. ""You have to look at it as a climate-change program.""

Canada has set targets to have 10 per cent of all passenger vehicles sold be electric by 2025, 30 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2040. Breton said that won't happen if the rebate isn't expanded.

Breton is also looking for the rebates to be extended to used electric and hybrid vehicles, which are now more easy to find than new ones in many cases. A 10-per-cent rebate on the purchase of a used electric car was mentioned in the mandate letter for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains last fall but has not yet been announced.

Transport Minister Marc Garneau was instructed in his mandate letter to do more to make the electric car sales quotas. Before the pandemic, he indicated he was looking at what more to do, including extending or expanding the rebate program. Something was expected in the March federal budget, delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Garneau's spokeswoman was noncommittal Thursday when asked if the rebate program would be expanded.

""This specific program continues and consumers are able to make use of the incentive,"" Livia Belcea said in an email. ""Any changes in funding for the program would be reviewed at the appropriate time and as needed.""

Loblaw Companies Ltd., which began offering COVID-19 testing for patients at a handful of its Alberta pharmacy locations in June, plans to expand the program to all 234 of its pharmacies in the province by Sept. 1.

The company says it has reached out to all 10 provinces to discuss in-store testing outside Alberta, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford this week acknowledging the possibility.

The swab tests are only for those with no symptoms or any known contact with coronavirus patients and may be useful for teachers returning to school or Canadians who take care of an older family member, said Theresa Firestone, head of health and wellness at Shoppers Drug Mart. Loblaw-owned pharmacy locations include Shoppers stores as well as Independent Foods and No Frills.

""It's very convenient. We're in every community. The other plus is they don't have to line up with people who may have symptoms. We've shared that with Ontario and with other provinces, so at this point we’re looking forward to what they may decide,"" Firestone said.

London Drugs also conducts COVID-19 tests in Alberta. It began offering the service at six locations during the past two weeks and plans to roll it out at nine more by October. Like Shoppers, it bills Alberta Health Services for testing costs.

The service builds on other responses to the pandemic such as online pharmacist consultations and a pilot program where patients consult virtually with doctors in a private room in the store.

London Drugs is among the pharmacy retailers beefing up their role in a health-care system grappling with an aging population.

""With the extended hours of operation, you can basically go in when our stores are open and be able to find a pharmacist to ask a question. So what we’re able to do at that point is basically help triage the system,"" said Chris Chiew, head of pharmacy at the Richmond, B.C.-based retailer.

London Drugs has also hired diabetes educators to test blood sugar levels and assist patients with weight management and diet.

Shoppers has stepped even further into the realm of physicians, opening one of three planned medical clinics with doctors who cater to a roster of patients and walk-in services.

""There are a number of Canadians who don’t have access to a family physician. And we thought there was an opportunity for us to really play a role here in terms of access,"" Firestone said.

Drugstores can also handle the bureaucratic side of health care, freeing up doctors to spend more time with patients, she said.

""Looking for PPE (personal protective equipment), sorting out their waiting rooms so that people are socially distanced, managing virtual care...we’re able to take that burden on for them,"" Firestone said.

In 2018, Shoppers launched its Wellwise store chain to sell assisted-living devices aimed at older Canadians. More recently, it began to offer tips and videos online designed to help ward off depression and anxiety.

Metro Inc. declined to comment on any attempts to provide COVID-19 testing. The bulk of the company's Jean Coutu drugstores are located in Quebec, which unlike some provinces does not allow pharmacists to conduct testing via nose and mouth swabs.

The Canadian Association of Broadcasters issued a report on Wednesday warning of potential closures and widespread job cuts as private TV and radio broadcasters face a cumulative projected revenue shortfall of up to $1.06 billion by the end of 2022.

Most vulnerable are the country's AM radio stations, the report said, as well as other independent private radio and TV operations in smaller markets across the country.

The study, titled ""The Crisis in Canadian Media and the Future of Local Broadcasting,"" was commissioned by the CAB, which represents the majority of private broadcasters in Canada, and conducted through Winnipeg-based independent media economics consultancy Communications Management Inc.

The CAB says it's concerned about the fallout from a substantial erosion in local advertising revenues over recent months.

Radio stations may be hardest hit in the short term, the report suggests, partly due to many advertisers pulling back on their spending in the pandemic and hastening a decline in the media industry's revenues.

Private radio ad revenues are expected to be $383 million below last year, it said.

The report's projections suggest that without further government support those declines could mean as many as 50 private local radio stations go out of business over the next four to six months.

Another 150 radio stations could topple in the 18 months that follow, it said, leading to as many as 2,000 job losses.

TV stations could risk a similar fate with roughly 40 of Canada's 94 private TV broadcasters in danger of closing within one to three years, the research predicts.

The CAB is calling on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to take swift action by establishing a ""more fair and sustainable future"" for local media.

Last month, the organization sent an emergency application to the CRTC requesting permission for broadcasters to be relieved of certain terms of their agreements, such as spending requirements on Canadian programming, for the broadcast year that ends Aug. 31.

Lenore Gibson, chair of the CAB, said broadcasters have ""done their utmost to cut expenses"" in areas such as administration, and ""the last thing that they want to do is cut into programming costs, but that's the only area that's left now.""

The CAB is urging the federal government to provide emergency regulatory relief as well as greater ""targeted support"" for the industry starting this fall.

Without greater financial measures in place, the CAB says the effects could leave many communities with only national and international media organizations to provide them with most of their news, effectively eliminating most community coverage of local politics, health and education in some regions of the country.

Bo Horvat scored twice, and Tyler Toffoli and Elias Pettersson each had a goal and two assists as the Canucks defeated the Golden Knights 5-2 at Rogers Place.

article continues below

The best-of-seven second-round series is tied 1-1. Game 3 goes Thursday.

Forty-eight hours earlier, the Golden Knights, now 8-2 in the post-season, had manhandled the Canucks en route to a 5-0 pounding in Game 1.

""For us as a team we wanted to bounce back from Game 1. We weren't happy with that,"" said Pettersson.

""We played a good game. We should be happy about it but (we need) a short-term memory and be ready for Game 3.""

Goaltender Jacob Markstrom made 38 saves for the win while Robin Lehner stopped 22 shots for Vegas. It's the first time Vegas has allowed more than five goals in a game in the return-to-play tournament.

It was the first game back for Toffoli since the opening game of the qualifying round against the Minnesota Wild on Aug. 2. The NHL is not releasing information on injuries, but Toffoli had been seen in a walking boot.

Toffoli jumped over the boards for his first shift in the first period and scored nine seconds later, taking a cross-crease pass from Pettersson to put the puck into a yawning net. He then made it 2-0 on the power play, delivering a tape-to-tape pass to an incoming Horvat, who blasted it past Lehner.

""It's fun to get back in the lineup and get a big win and tie this series up,"" said Toffoli, who had been acquired at the trade deadline from the Los Angeles Kings. He had put up 10 points in his first 10 games with the Canucks before the regular season ended March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I made some phone calls yesterday, talked to a lot of people. It was a busy day,"" said Toffoli. ""It was good obviously getting the OK from everybody (to play). I got all excited. Felt like I was coming back to my first playoff series.""

Vancouver coach Travis Green said the 5-0 loss was their worst game of the playoffs and that Game 2 was a must-win.

""You go down two (games) against that team early in the series it would be tough and just mentally, too (to come back),"" he said.

""We were better with the puck, played a more direct game. I thought we were better on our feet, quicker. That's a good hockey team. I thought we did a good job of making them defend more than we did the first game.""

Despite being down by two goals in the second period, the Golden Knights looked like they were going to run the Canucks out of the rink again.

Markstrom kept the Canucks alive as Vegas tilted the ice and turned his net into a shooting gallery, blasting away for 22 shots in the period. Vegas got one goal back from Alex Tuch before Pettersson scored on a cross-ice feed from Alex Edler to make it 3-1 heading into the third.

""That really was a back-breaker,"" said Vegas head coach Peter DeBoer. ""You're down 3-1 and you have nothing to show for the work you put in to try and get back in the game.""

Tuch added: ""We knew Vancouver wasn't happy with the way they played last game and we knew they were going to come out flying. And we decided instead of being prepared, (to) be surprised by that for some reason.""

Vancouver iced the game 18 seconds into the third on Horvat's second goal. Then the frustration finally got to Vegas.

First, Max Pacioretty grabbed J.T. Miller by the head and threw him down after the whistle for a roughing penalty. Tuch got a double minor for pummelling Jake Virtanen while the Vancouver forward lay on the ice.

Pacioretty scored late for Vegas and Tanner Pearson added the final Vancouver goal into an empty net.

Horvat had not found the scoresheet since scoring two goals in each of the first two games against the St. Louis Blues in the first round.

Pettersson has been a steady point-getter throughout the playoffs but had been shut down by Vegas in Game 1, limited to no shots on net and one blocked shot.

Markstrom, in his first playoff series, has been the locomotive pulling the Canucks' playoff train. He allowed just nine goals on 121 shots (.926 save percentage) against Minnesota in the first round while registering his first playoff shutout. He saved 29 of 34 against the Blues (.930).

The series is being played at a fan-less Rogers Place. Players are isolating between contests to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This was Williams’ fifth match since professional tennis resumed amid the coronavirus pandemic after a hiatus of nearly six months — and all five have gone three sets. She is 3-2 in that stretch.

The result against No. 13 seed Sakkari, and particularly the way the match ended, was hardly promising for Williams as the U.S. Open’s start approaches next week.

The Western & Southern Open is usually held in Ohio but was moved to the U.S. Open’s site in Flushing Meadows this year to make for a two-event, no-spectator ""bubble"" during the pandemic.

In men's play, Canada's Milos Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Andy Murray. Raonic, from Thornhill, Ont., is the last Canadian remaining in the draw.

Williams was seemingly in control early, serving for the first set at 5-3, 30-0, when things began to unravel. She missed two backhands in a row, then put a forehand into the net to set up a break point, and walked over to the stand holding her towel at the back of the court (the ball people normally handle towels for players, but not during COVID-19).

That’s when chair umpire Aurelie Tourte called a time violation. On the following point, Williams sailed a forehand long to get broken.

At the ensuing changeover, the 23-time Grand Slam champion argued with Tourte, saying: ""I mean, I’m getting my own towels. That’s not fair. You should tell me on the sidelines next time if I need to play faster. Believe me, I will. ... You didn't even give me a warning.""

While Williams eventually did grab that set, she again frittered away a 5-3 lead in the second, plus a 4-1 edge in the tiebreaker. When she sat after the second set, the 38-year-old American tossed her racket over her shoulder the way an office worker might flip a crumpled piece of paper toward a trash can.

Williams came out flat in the third set, as if she’d rather be anywhere else. She double-faulted four times in the second game, including on Sakkari’s eighth break chance, to make it 2-0 and that was pretty much that.

Hours earlier, Novak Djokovic’s neck felt much better, and his tennis looked much better, in a 6-2, 6-4 victory over unseeded American Tennys Sandgren that improved the No. 1-ranked man to 20-0 in 2020.

""Actually, I’m pleasantly surprised with the way I recovered and felt today — just overall, physically, but also with the neck, specifically, because that was a little bit of a concern,"" said Djokovic, who will be eyeing his 18th Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open. ""Going back four, five days, I did struggle quite a lot.""

Djokovic was treated by a trainer and played sluggishly in his opening match Monday, but he was at his best from the outset against Sandgren and saved all four break points he faced.

Djokovic will face 34th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff in the quarterfinals. The other quarterfinal in the top half of the draw will be defending champion Daniil Medvedev against No. 8 seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Reilly Opelka, a 6-foot-11 American who is ranked 39th, delivered 19 aces and knocked off 2019 U.S. Open semifinalist Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 7-6 (4). Opelka next meets No. 4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, whose 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4) win over No. 16 John Isner was interrupted by a rain delay of nearly 1 1/2 hours late in the first set.

Also interrupted by the weather was Raonic's victory over the three-time Grand Slam champion. Raonic, a Wimbledon runner-up in 2016, has held all 29 games he’s served so far in the tournament.

""I have done the work,"" Raonic said. ""I have put in the effort, and I'm just happy that this quickly the pieces are coming together.""

This was Murray's first tournament appearance since November. He missed time due to a pelvic injury and is playing on a metal hip after two operations on that joint.

""Didn’t play well. It was not a good day,"" Murray said. ""The positives are that I got three matches in. Physically, I pulled up OK.""

Women’s quarterfinal matchups set earlier in the day were two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka against Anett Kontaveit, former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka against Ons Jabeur, and 83rd-ranked American qualifier Jessica Pegula against No. 14 Elise Mertens.

He was 5 under after the front nine Tuesday at Ozarks National when he hit driver at the par-4 10th. The ball wound up in such heavy rough that Mickelson couldn't find it, forcing him to take a penalty stroke. He still wound up making a long putt to salvage bogey, and that gave him some momentum for the rest of the round.

""I was able to get right back to even par on the back side with a birdie on the next hole, and then I made a couple more coming in,"" said Mickelson, whose 7-under 64 left him 17 under.

That was good for a four-shot lead over Tim Petrovic and Rod Pampling, who will be his playing partners for the final round. Mike Weir of Bright's Grove, Ont., (69) was nine shots off the lead at 8 under.

""I've been putting really well,"" Mickelson said. ""Today I didn't drive it the way I've been driving it. I kind of a hung a few drives, so I'm going to the range and try to work on that now. But when I come out tomorrow I'll try to be a little bit more aggressive with the driver and see if I can make a few more birdies.""

A few more? He's already made 19 of them in his first 36 holes.

Playing in the final group and with the shadows getting long, Mickelson picked up right where he left off after his opening-round 61. He made birdie at the third and then rattled off three straight beginning at the par-4 fifth, where he nearly chipped in for eagle.

Petrovic tried to make a run at Mickelson, but even one of his career-low rounds only got him so close. His putter went cold down the stretch and a poor approach at the par-4 finishing hole resulted in bogey.

Mickelson added a bridie at the ninth, the only hole he bogeyed on Monday, after a pretty flop shot over the bunker. After the lost ball at the 10th, Mickelson responded by adding two more birdies.

The second of them at the par-3 12th was a backhanded tap-in. His approach shot barely carried onto the front edge of the green, then nestled up to about an inch from the hole.

Mickelson could still squander the lead in the final round Wednesday, when tee times were moved to the early morning because of expected bad weather in the afternoon. But given the quality of his short game through 36 holes, the more pressing question is whether he could break the PGA Tour Champions' 54-hole scoring record of 191 — shared by Bruce Fleisher, Loren Roberts, Bernhard Langer, David Frost and Rocco Mediate.

Mickelson, who decided to make his debut on the over-50 tour to continue his U.S. Open prep after he was eliminated from the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, would need to shoot 65 in his final round Wednesday to move atop the list.

Petrovic and Pampling each shot 64-65 over the first two rounds. Rocco Mediate struggled coming in and was at 12 under.

K.J. Choi was another shot back, and Steve Stricker and David McKenzie were at 10 under.

Moments later, the Chicago White Sox right-hander threw the final pitch in a truly bizarre performance.

A no-fan no-no.

With the seats at Guaranteed Rate Field empty, Giolito pitched the first no-hitter of the pandemic-delayed season, striking out 13 in leading the White Sox over the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 Tuesday night.

""2020 has been a very strange year,"" said Giolito, who conducted a postgame interview while wearing a mask. ""Obviously a lot of weird stuff going on with COVID and the state of the world, so may as well throw this in the mix.""

Sounds like he didn't mind that nobody saw it. Well, almost no one.

After right fielder Adam Engel extended on the run to catch Erik Gonzalez’s slicing drive toward the line for the final out, the hollers of Giolito’s teammates in the middle of the diamond echoed around the stadium.

""I’m just stoked for Lucas and so happy and ecstatic and emotional for Lucas,"" Engel said. ""It stinks we couldn’t celebrate the way most no-hitters get celebrated.""

The smallest crowd listed for any no-hitter in the majors over the last 100 years came in 1944, when a mere 1,014 watched Cincinnati’s Clyde Shoun beat the Braves at Crosley Field.

Nowhere close to that number on this night, not with the park that holds over 40,000 closed to fans because of virus protocols.

Suffice to say, years from now when White Sox fans fondly remember Giolito’s gem, there will not be, say, 100,000 or so people claiming they were there to see it in person.

At one point early in the game, some members of grounds crew drifted in sight, but that was about it outside of the teams.

An All-Star last year, the 26-year-old Giolito (3-2) matched his career high for strikeouts set in his previous start against Detroit.

Only a four-pitch walk to Gonzalez leading off the fourth inning got in Giolito’s way of perfection. That was only runner he permitted while throwing 101 pitches

""I’ve been working for this type of game for a while now and it’s really cool that we got it done,"" Giolito said.

Giolito relied on his changeup and fastball to make quick work of the Pirates, who came into the game batting just .229 and have the worst record in the majors. Six of their starters finished the game hitting under .199 this season.

The White Sox rushed toward the mound after the final out in Giolito’s first career no-hitter. Giolito hugged catcher James McCann as the Chicago players joined the party.

The South Side of Chicago normally rattles with fireworks after a home win -- this is the club that gave the game the exploding scoreboard -- but the park remained silent as the dugout emptied.

Giolito, meanwhile, was locked in his own zone in the later innings, fully aware of what was at stake.

""After the seventh, six more outs, looking at who I was facing, became very, very, very possible,"" he said, ""and then we were able to get it done.""

Giolito said his approach never wavered.

""Just staying with the same, like, mental routine for every single pitch. One pitch at a time. Full focus, full execution, straight through the target,"" he said.

Giolito pitched the 19th no-hitter in White Sox history — second most to the Dodgers' 23 — and first since Philip Humber threw a perfect game at Seattle in 2012. This was the seventh time the Pirates have been held hitless, with Washington’s Max Scherzer having done it in 2015.

White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson made a nifty play on a grounder by Bryan Reynolds up the middle in the seventh to preserve the gem, helped by first baseman Jose Abreu’s stretch at the bag.

In the ninth, Gonzalez hit a liner that Engel, a fleet centre fielder for most of his career, caught on the run at knee-high height.

""Yeah man, I think I got it,"" Gonzalez said. ""With that at-bat, I was a little bit mad because I don’t want to be part of history.""

Giolito improved to 30-28 in his big league career. He made his debut with Washington in 2016, then was traded after that season to the White Sox in a package for outfielder Adam Eaton.

Giolito gave up a major league-high 118 earned runs in 2018, his first full season in Chicago.

""I was pretty much bottom of the league in almost every stat,"" Giolito said. ""I kind of had to ... learn from failure to learn my true potential.""

He added: ""I always envisioned that I’d throw a no-hitter in the big leagues.""

Giolito threw the first no-hitter at Guaranteed Rate Field since Minnesota’s Francisco Liriano did it in 2011.

The White Sox, who’ve won eight of their last nine, ended the Pirates’ season-best winning streak at three games.

Giolito was dominant in his previous start, too, fanning 13 against Detroit and allowing just three hits in seven innings. The victory over Pittsburgh was his third career shutout.

Chicago’s first three batters reached in the second and all three came home one at a time after Engel’s groundout and singles Anderson and Eloy Jimenez. McCann added a sacrifice fly in the third off Steven Brault (0-1).

TRAINER’S ROOM

Pirates: RH reliever Keone Kela was available to pitch after leaving Friday’s loss to Milwaukee with forearm tightness. … Infielders Colin Moran (collision) and Kevin Newman (abdomen) also were on the bench after leaving Sunday’s game.

White Sox: McCann stayed in the game after being struck near his left hand by a second-inning pitch from Brault. ... Jimenez appeared to be getting treatment near the mound after the celebration, but manager Rick Renteria said he walked off under his own power.

UP NEXT

LHP Dallas Keuchel (4-2, 2.65) looks for his third straight win Wednesday afternoon against Pirates RHP Trevor Williams (1-4, 3.70).

His team gave up a goal he felt shouldn't have counted three minutes into the opening period and had a subsequent equalizer called back on a razor-thin offside challenge.

Down 1-0 in the series and playing well, Tampa Bay then grabbed its first lead in more than 110 minutes of action midway through the third period only to see Boston tie it up with under four minutes to go in regulation.

""Adversity strikes in the weirdest ways,"" Cooper said. ""You never know when it's going to happen.

""Sometimes you're just dealt ... a sandwich that doesn't taste very good, if you know what I mean.""

And deal with it they did.

Ondrej Palat scored at 4:40 of overtime as the Lightning defeated the Bruins 4-3 to even their second-round playoff series 1-1.

Blake Coleman added two goals in regulation for the Lightning, while Nikita Kucherov had the other. Andrei Vasilevskiy made 22 saves to get the win.

""If there was one message that was going on it was we liked everything that was going on about the game,"" Cooper said. ""I know it sounds so cliche, but we just had to stick with it. Some teams, if you have mental weakness at all, you're probably sitting there saying, 'Poor us.'

""But it's just not been this group. That's not how they operate.""

Brad Marchand buried his second of the night to tie things with under four minutes left in the third period for the Bruins, while Nick Ritchie also scored. David Pastrnak added two assists for Boston, which got 36 stops from Jaroslav Halak.

The teams don't have much time to digest the result, with Game 3 of the best-of-seven matchup set for Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET back inside the fan-less Scotiabank Arena.

Tampa, which beat the Columbus Blue Jackets in quintuple overtime of Game 1 in the opening round before closing out the series in the extra period of Game 5 on a pair of goals from Brayden Point, got the winner after Boston couldn't clear its zone.

Patrick Maroon tried a wraparound that Halak stopped, but Palat was there to bury the rebound to score his first of the post-season and send the Lightning pouring off their bench in celebration.

""It's obviously big-time frustrating any time you lose a game and especially in that fashion,"" Bruins centre Sean Kuraly said. ""We thought we were trending in the right direction, (thinking) momentum may be swinging our way. You get the puck close to the blue line a couple times and you don't get it out, and against a good team that's what happens.

""It ends up in the back of your net.""

Acquired prior to February's trade deadline from the New Jersey Devils, Coleman gave Tampa its first lead of the series at 10:40 of the third after taking a stretch pass from Victor Hedman. The Lightning centre moved in alone on Halak and snuck an off-speed shot through the five-hole after getting slashed by Bruins defenceman Connor Clifton.

Boston, however, responded with 3:58 left in regulation when Marchand finished off a pretty passing play. With the Bruins in the middle of a change — Patrice Bergeron would normally be on the ice — Kuraly took a feed from Pastrnak and quickly found Marchand to bury his sixth and knot things up.

The Bruins, who triumphed 3-2 in Game 1 on the back of Halak's 35-save performance, took a 2-1 lead with 5:27 left in the second on a power play when Pastrnak faked a one-timer before sliding a pass to Marchand at the side of the net.

Tampa responded 56 seconds later after some great work from Point. The diminutive centre twisted and turned in the Bruins zone before finding Kevin Shattenkirk, whose shot was tipped in by Kucherov for his third.

The Lightning dressed seven defencemen with Ryan McDonagh (undisclosed), who has averaged a team-high 26:07 of ice time in the post-season, out injured after leaving midway through the third period of Game 1. Veteran blue-liners Luke Schenn and Braydon Coburn drew in, while Carter Verhaeghe was scratched up front.

Boston owned the best record in the NHL when the league suspended its season because of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, but dropped to the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference after losing all three of its games in the round-robin portion of the restart.

The Bruins found their groove in the first round of the usual 16-team playoff bracket, disposing of the Carolina Hurricanes in five games.

Tampa, meanwhile, had the second-best mark in the East and was fourth overall when the schedule was halted. The Lightning finished second in the round-robin and then downed Columbus.

The Bruins jumped out to a 1-0 lead at 3:14 of Tuesday's first period after Tampa defenceman Zach Bogosian's stick disintegrated at the offensive blue line. Boston broke the other way, with Ritchie stuffing his first past Vasilevskiy, who thought he had the puck covered — much to Cooper's chagrin.

The Lightning responded a couple minutes later when Barclay Goodrow tipped Coburn's point shot up and over Halak. The Bruins, however, correctly challenged for offside after Point was a fraction of a second too slow exiting the Boston zone on the tag up.

Cooper fired a number of expletives at the officials when the call was reversed, but was back smiling on the bench after a surprising burst from an unlikely source eventually knotted the score.

Bogosian, a bruising blue-liner known mostly for his physical play, split two Boston defenders, and as he was getting knocked down fed a diving Coleman, who slid his second past Halak before crashing into the net at 12:42.

""I saw Bogo picking up some speed,"" Coleman said. ""He just kind of had that look in his eye like he was about to do something. I just made it a point to get up into play with him, try to give him an option.

""He made a heck of a play.""

It was also the first sign the Lightning weren't going to be fazed by that early adversity.

""Any time there's a mishap, you just turn the page,"" Cooper said of his roster. ""It was needed tonight, I'll tell you that, because they need to be rewarded for the work they were doing.

""And in the end, they were.""

The judges scored it 30-26, 30-27 and 29-28 for Romero. But White pointed out that the 23-year-old from Welland, Ont., failed to finish his damaged opponent and had trouble when Breeden switched to southpaw.

""He's 23 years old, he's a young kid. I absolutely positively think he's going to be in the UFC some day. Just not tonight,"" said White.

Romero (8-0-0) was the busier fighter in the first round. He took Breeden down twice in the second round and punished the American with leg kicks.

The 31-year-old Breeden (8-3-0) got Romero's attention late in the round with a knee to the head but was limping as he went back to his corner.

Breeden's leg buckled repeatedly in the third as Romero kept lashing him with kicks. But despite the damage from 25 kicks in total, Breeden kept coming forward and swinging.

""Those calf kicks were nasty,"" said Romero. ""My legs are actually hurting from them so you know they're pretty hard.""

""He's super-tough ... He has a lot of heart,"" he said of Breeden.

Loblaw Companies Ltd., which began offering COVID-19 testing for patients at a handful of its Alberta pharmacy locations in June, plans to expand the program to all 234 of its pharmacies in the province by Sept. 1.

article continues below

The company says it has reached out to all 10 provinces to discuss in-store testing outside Alberta, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford this week acknowledging the possibility.

The swab tests are only for those with no symptoms or any known contact with coronavirus patients and may be useful for teachers returning to school or Canadians who take care of an older family member, said Theresa Firestone, head of health and wellness at Shoppers Drug Mart. Loblaw-owned pharmacy locations include Shoppers stores as well as Independent Foods and No Frills.

""It's very convenient. We're in every community. The other plus is they don't have to line up with people who may have symptoms. We've shared that with Ontario and with other provinces, so at this point we’re looking forward to what they may decide,"" Firestone said.

London Drugs also conducts COVID-19 tests in Alberta. It began offering the service at six locations during the past two weeks and plans to roll it out at nine more by October. Like Shoppers, it bills Alberta Health Services for testing costs.

The service builds on other responses to the pandemic such as online pharmacist consultations and a pilot program where patients consult virtually with doctors in a private room in the store.

London Drugs is among the pharmacy retailers beefing up their role in a health-care system grappling with an aging population.

""With the extended hours of operation, you can basically go in when our stores are open and be able to find a pharmacist to ask a question. So what we’re able to do at that point is basically help triage the system,"" said Chris Chiew, head of pharmacy at the Richmond, B.C.-based retailer.

London Drugs has also hired diabetes educators to test blood sugar levels and assist patients with weight management and diet.

Shoppers has stepped even further into the realm of physicians, opening one of three planned medical clinics with doctors who cater to a roster of patients and walk-in services.

""There are a number of Canadians who don’t have access to a family physician. And we thought there was an opportunity for us to really play a role here in terms of access,"" Firestone said.

Drugstores can also handle the bureaucratic side of health care, freeing up doctors to spend more time with patients, she said.

""Looking for PPE (personal protective equipment), sorting out their waiting rooms so that people are socially distanced, managing virtual care...we’re able to take that burden on for them,"" Firestone said.

In 2018, Shoppers launched its Wellwise store chain to sell assisted-living devices aimed at older Canadians. More recently, it began to offer tips and videos online designed to help ward off depression and anxiety.

Metro Inc. declined to comment on any attempts to provide COVID-19 testing. The bulk of the company's Jean Coutu drugstores are located in Quebec, which unlike some provinces does not allow pharmacists to conduct testing via nose and mouth swabs.

The Canadian Association of Broadcasters issued a report on Wednesday warning of potential closures and widespread job cuts as private TV and radio broadcasters face a cumulative projected revenue shortfall of up to $1.06 billion by the end of 2022.

Most vulnerable are the country's AM radio stations, the report said, as well as other independent private radio and TV operations in smaller markets across the country.

The study, titled ""The Crisis in Canadian Media and the Future of Local Broadcasting,"" was commissioned by the CAB, which represents the majority of private broadcasters in Canada, and conducted through Winnipeg-based independent media economics consultancy Communications Management Inc.

The CAB says it's concerned about the fallout from a substantial erosion in local advertising revenues over recent months.

Radio stations may be hardest hit in the short term, the report suggests, partly due to many advertisers pulling back on their spending in the pandemic and hastening a decline in the media industry's revenues.

Private radio ad revenues are expected to be $383 million below last year, it said.

The report's projections suggest that without further government support those declines could mean as many as 50 private local radio stations go out of business over the next four to six months.

Another 150 radio stations could topple in the 18 months that follow, it said, leading to as many as 2,000 job losses.

TV stations could risk a similar fate with roughly 40 of Canada's 94 private TV broadcasters in danger of closing within one to three years, the research predicts.

The CAB is calling on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to take swift action by establishing a ""more fair and sustainable future"" for local media.

Last month, the organization sent an emergency application to the CRTC requesting permission for broadcasters to be relieved of certain terms of their agreements, such as spending requirements on Canadian programming, for the broadcast year that ends Aug. 31.

Lenore Gibson, chair of the CAB, said broadcasters have ""done their utmost to cut expenses"" in areas such as administration, and ""the last thing that they want to do is cut into programming costs, but that's the only area that's left now.""

The CAB is urging the federal government to provide emergency regulatory relief as well as greater ""targeted support"" for the industry starting this fall.

Without greater financial measures in place, the CAB says the effects could leave many communities with only national and international media organizations to provide them with most of their news, effectively eliminating most community coverage of local politics, health and education in some regions of the country.

Markstrom, in his first playoff series, has been the locomotive pulling the Canucks' playoff train.","EDMONTON — The Vancouver Canucks, coming off their worst performance of the playoffs, delivered one of their best efforts of the post-season Tuesday, stopping the Vegas Golden Knights juggernaut in its tracks.

Bo Horvat scored twice, and Tyler Toffoli and Elias Pettersson each had a goal and two assists as the Canucks defeated the Golden Knights 5-2 at Rogers Place.

The best-of-seven second-round series is tied 1-1. Game 3 goes Thursday.

Forty-eight hours earlier, the Golden Knights, now 8-2 in the post-season, had manhandled the Canucks en route to a 5-0 pounding in Game 1.

""For us as a team we wanted to bounce back from Game 1. We weren't happy with that,"" said Pettersson.

""We played a good game. We should be happy about it but (we need) a short-term memory and be ready for Game 3.""

Goaltender Jacob Markstrom made 38 saves for the win while Robin Lehner stopped 22 shots for Vegas. It's the first time Vegas has allowed more than five goals in a game in the return-to-play tournament.

It was the first game back for Toffoli since the opening game of the qualifying round against the Minnesota Wild on Aug. 2. The NHL is not releasing information on injuries, but Toffoli had been seen in a walking boot.

Toffoli jumped over the boards for his first shift in the first period and scored nine seconds later, taking a cross-crease pass from Pettersson to put the puck into a yawning net. He then made it 2-0 on the power play, delivering a tape-to-tape pass to an incoming Horvat, who blasted it past Lehner.

""It's fun to get back in the lineup and get a big win and tie this series up,"" said Toffoli, who had been acquired at the trade deadline from the Los Angeles Kings. He had put up 10 points in his first 10 games with the Canucks before the regular season ended March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I made some phone calls yesterday, talked to a lot of people. It was a busy day,"" said Toffoli. ""It was good obviously getting the OK from everybody (to play). I got all excited. Felt like I was coming back to my first playoff series.""

Vancouver coach Travis Green said the 5-0 loss was their worst game of the playoffs and that Game 2 was a must-win.

""You go down two (games) against that team early in the series it would be tough and just mentally, too (to come back),"" he said.

""We were better with the puck, played a more direct game. I thought we were better on our feet, quicker. That's a good hockey team. I thought we did a good job of making them defend more than we did the first game.""

Despite being down by two goals in the second period, the Golden Knights looked like they were going to run the Canucks out of the rink again.

Markstrom kept the Canucks alive as Vegas tilted the ice and turned his net into a shooting gallery, blasting away for 22 shots in the period. Vegas got one goal back from Alex Tuch before Pettersson scored on a cross-ice feed from Alex Edler to make it 3-1 heading into the third.

""That really was a back-breaker,"" said Vegas head coach Peter DeBoer. ""You're down 3-1 and you have nothing to show for the work you put in to try and get back in the game.""

Tuch added: ""We knew Vancouver wasn't happy with the way they played last game and we knew they were going to come out flying. And we decided instead of being prepared, (to) be surprised by that for some reason.""

Vancouver iced the game 18 seconds into the third on Horvat's second goal. Then the frustration finally got to Vegas.

First, Max Pacioretty grabbed J.T. Miller by the head and threw him down after the whistle for a roughing penalty. Tuch got a double minor for pummelling Jake Virtanen while the Vancouver forward lay on the ice.

Pacioretty scored late for Vegas and Tanner Pearson added the final Vancouver goal into an empty net.

Horvat had not found the scoresheet since scoring two goals in each of the first two games against the St. Louis Blues in the first round.

Pettersson has been a steady point-getter throughout the playoffs but had been shut down by Vegas in Game 1, limited to no shots on net and one blocked shot.

Markstrom, in his first playoff series, has been the locomotive pulling the Canucks' playoff train. He allowed just nine goals on 121 shots (.926 save percentage) against Minnesota in the first round while registering his first playoff shutout. He saved 29 of 34 against the Blues (.930).

The series is being played at a fan-less Rogers Place. Players are isolating between contests to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This was Williams’ fifth match since professional tennis resumed amid the coronavirus pandemic after a hiatus of nearly six months — and all five have gone three sets. She is 3-2 in that stretch.

The result against No. 13 seed Sakkari, and particularly the way the match ended, was hardly promising for Williams as the U.S. Open’s start approaches next week.

The Western & Southern Open is usually held in Ohio but was moved to the U.S. Open’s site in Flushing Meadows this year to make for a two-event, no-spectator ""bubble"" during the pandemic.

In men's play, Canada's Milos Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Andy Murray. Raonic, from Thornhill, Ont., is the last Canadian remaining in the draw.

Williams was seemingly in control early, serving for the first set at 5-3, 30-0, when things began to unravel. She missed two backhands in a row, then put a forehand into the net to set up a break point, and walked over to the stand holding her towel at the back of the court (the ball people normally handle towels for players, but not during COVID-19).

That’s when chair umpire Aurelie Tourte called a time violation. On the following point, Williams sailed a forehand long to get broken.

At the ensuing changeover, the 23-time Grand Slam champion argued with Tourte, saying: ""I mean, I’m getting my own towels. That’s not fair. You should tell me on the sidelines next time if I need to play faster. Believe me, I will. ... You didn't even give me a warning.""

While Williams eventually did grab that set, she again frittered away a 5-3 lead in the second, plus a 4-1 edge in the tiebreaker. When she sat after the second set, the 38-year-old American tossed her racket over her shoulder the way an office worker might flip a crumpled piece of paper toward a trash can.

Williams came out flat in the third set, as if she’d rather be anywhere else. She double-faulted four times in the second game, including on Sakkari’s eighth break chance, to make it 2-0 and that was pretty much that.

Hours earlier, Novak Djokovic’s neck felt much better, and his tennis looked much better, in a 6-2, 6-4 victory over unseeded American Tennys Sandgren that improved the No. 1-ranked man to 20-0 in 2020.

""Actually, I’m pleasantly surprised with the way I recovered and felt today — just overall, physically, but also with the neck, specifically, because that was a little bit of a concern,"" said Djokovic, who will be eyeing his 18th Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open. ""Going back four, five days, I did struggle quite a lot.""

Djokovic was treated by a trainer and played sluggishly in his opening match Monday, but he was at his best from the outset against Sandgren and saved all four break points he faced.

Djokovic will face 34th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff in the quarterfinals. The other quarterfinal in the top half of the draw will be defending champion Daniil Medvedev against No. 8 seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Reilly Opelka, a 6-foot-11 American who is ranked 39th, delivered 19 aces and knocked off 2019 U.S. Open semifinalist Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 7-6 (4). Opelka next meets No. 4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, whose 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4) win over No. 16 John Isner was interrupted by a rain delay of nearly 1 1/2 hours late in the first set.

Also interrupted by the weather was Raonic's victory over the three-time Grand Slam champion. Raonic, a Wimbledon runner-up in 2016, has held all 29 games he’s served so far in the tournament.

""I have done the work,"" Raonic said. ""I have put in the effort, and I'm just happy that this quickly the pieces are coming together.""

This was Murray's first tournament appearance since November. He missed time due to a pelvic injury and is playing on a metal hip after two operations on that joint.

""Didn’t play well. It was not a good day,"" Murray said. ""The positives are that I got three matches in. Physically, I pulled up OK.""

Women’s quarterfinal matchups set earlier in the day were two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka against Anett Kontaveit, former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka against Ons Jabeur, and 83rd-ranked American qualifier Jessica Pegula against No. 14 Elise Mertens.

He was 5 under after the front nine Tuesday at Ozarks National when he hit driver at the par-4 10th. The ball wound up in such heavy rough that Mickelson couldn't find it, forcing him to take a penalty stroke. He still wound up making a long putt to salvage bogey, and that gave him some momentum for the rest of the round.

""I was able to get right back to even par on the back side with a birdie on the next hole, and then I made a couple more coming in,"" said Mickelson, whose 7-under 64 left him 17 under.

That was good for a four-shot lead over Tim Petrovic and Rod Pampling, who will be his playing partners for the final round. Mike Weir of Bright's Grove, Ont., (69) was nine shots off the lead at 8 under.

""I've been putting really well,"" Mickelson said. ""Today I didn't drive it the way I've been driving it. I kind of a hung a few drives, so I'm going to the range and try to work on that now. But when I come out tomorrow I'll try to be a little bit more aggressive with the driver and see if I can make a few more birdies.""

A few more? He's already made 19 of them in his first 36 holes.

Playing in the final group and with the shadows getting long, Mickelson picked up right where he left off after his opening-round 61. He made birdie at the third and then rattled off three straight beginning at the par-4 fifth, where he nearly chipped in for eagle.

Petrovic tried to make a run at Mickelson, but even one of his career-low rounds only got him so close. His putter went cold down the stretch and a poor approach at the par-4 finishing hole resulted in bogey.

Mickelson added a bridie at the ninth, the only hole he bogeyed on Monday, after a pretty flop shot over the bunker. After the lost ball at the 10th, Mickelson responded by adding two more birdies.

The second of them at the par-3 12th was a backhanded tap-in. His approach shot barely carried onto the front edge of the green, then nestled up to about an inch from the hole.

Mickelson could still squander the lead in the final round Wednesday, when tee times were moved to the early morning because of expected bad weather in the afternoon. But given the quality of his short game through 36 holes, the more pressing question is whether he could break the PGA Tour Champions' 54-hole scoring record of 191 — shared by Bruce Fleisher, Loren Roberts, Bernhard Langer, David Frost and Rocco Mediate.

Mickelson, who decided to make his debut on the over-50 tour to continue his U.S. Open prep after he was eliminated from the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, would need to shoot 65 in his final round Wednesday to move atop the list.

Petrovic and Pampling each shot 64-65 over the first two rounds. Rocco Mediate struggled coming in and was at 12 under.

K.J. Choi was another shot back, and Steve Stricker and David McKenzie were at 10 under.

Moments later, the Chicago White Sox right-hander threw the final pitch in a truly bizarre performance.

article continues below

A no-fan no-no.

With the seats at Guaranteed Rate Field empty, Giolito pitched the first no-hitter of the pandemic-delayed season, striking out 13 in leading the White Sox over the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 Tuesday night.

""2020 has been a very strange year,"" said Giolito, who conducted a postgame interview while wearing a mask. ""Obviously a lot of weird stuff going on with COVID and the state of the world, so may as well throw this in the mix.""

Sounds like he didn't mind that nobody saw it. Well, almost no one.

After right fielder Adam Engel extended on the run to catch Erik Gonzalez’s slicing drive toward the line for the final out, the hollers of Giolito’s teammates in the middle of the diamond echoed around the stadium.

""I’m just stoked for Lucas and so happy and ecstatic and emotional for Lucas,"" Engel said. ""It stinks we couldn’t celebrate the way most no-hitters get celebrated.""

The smallest crowd listed for any no-hitter in the majors over the last 100 years came in 1944, when a mere 1,014 watched Cincinnati’s Clyde Shoun beat the Braves at Crosley Field.

Nowhere close to that number on this night, not with the park that holds over 40,000 closed to fans because of virus protocols.

Suffice to say, years from now when White Sox fans fondly remember Giolito’s gem, there will not be, say, 100,000 or so people claiming they were there to see it in person.

At one point early in the game, some members of grounds crew drifted in sight, but that was about it outside of the teams.

An All-Star last year, the 26-year-old Giolito (3-2) matched his career high for strikeouts set in his previous start against Detroit.

Only a four-pitch walk to Gonzalez leading off the fourth inning got in Giolito’s way of perfection. That was only runner he permitted while throwing 101 pitches

""I’ve been working for this type of game for a while now and it’s really cool that we got it done,"" Giolito said.

Giolito relied on his changeup and fastball to make quick work of the Pirates, who came into the game batting just .229 and have the worst record in the majors. Six of their starters finished the game hitting under .199 this season.

The White Sox rushed toward the mound after the final out in Giolito’s first career no-hitter. Giolito hugged catcher James McCann as the Chicago players joined the party.

The South Side of Chicago normally rattles with fireworks after a home win -- this is the club that gave the game the exploding scoreboard -- but the park remained silent as the dugout emptied.

Giolito, meanwhile, was locked in his own zone in the later innings, fully aware of what was at stake.

""After the seventh, six more outs, looking at who I was facing, became very, very, very possible,"" he said, ""and then we were able to get it done.""

Giolito said his approach never wavered.

""Just staying with the same, like, mental routine for every single pitch. One pitch at a time. Full focus, full execution, straight through the target,"" he said.

Giolito pitched the 19th no-hitter in White Sox history — second most to the Dodgers' 23 — and first since Philip Humber threw a perfect game at Seattle in 2012. This was the seventh time the Pirates have been held hitless, with Washington’s Max Scherzer having done it in 2015.

White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson made a nifty play on a grounder by Bryan Reynolds up the middle in the seventh to preserve the gem, helped by first baseman Jose Abreu’s stretch at the bag.

In the ninth, Gonzalez hit a liner that Engel, a fleet centre fielder for most of his career, caught on the run at knee-high height.

""Yeah man, I think I got it,"" Gonzalez said. ""With that at-bat, I was a little bit mad because I don’t want to be part of history.""

Giolito improved to 30-28 in his big league career. He made his debut with Washington in 2016, then was traded after that season to the White Sox in a package for outfielder Adam Eaton.

Giolito gave up a major league-high 118 earned runs in 2018, his first full season in Chicago.

""I was pretty much bottom of the league in almost every stat,"" Giolito said. ""I kind of had to ... learn from failure to learn my true potential.""

He added: ""I always envisioned that I’d throw a no-hitter in the big leagues.""

Giolito threw the first no-hitter at Guaranteed Rate Field since Minnesota’s Francisco Liriano did it in 2011.

The White Sox, who’ve won eight of their last nine, ended the Pirates’ season-best winning streak at three games.

Giolito was dominant in his previous start, too, fanning 13 against Detroit and allowing just three hits in seven innings. The victory over Pittsburgh was his third career shutout.

Chicago’s first three batters reached in the second and all three came home one at a time after Engel’s groundout and singles Anderson and Eloy Jimenez. McCann added a sacrifice fly in the third off Steven Brault (0-1).

TRAINER’S ROOM

Pirates: RH reliever Keone Kela was available to pitch after leaving Friday’s loss to Milwaukee with forearm tightness. … Infielders Colin Moran (collision) and Kevin Newman (abdomen) also were on the bench after leaving Sunday’s game.

White Sox: McCann stayed in the game after being struck near his left hand by a second-inning pitch from Brault. ... Jimenez appeared to be getting treatment near the mound after the celebration, but manager Rick Renteria said he walked off under his own power.

UP NEXT

LHP Dallas Keuchel (4-2, 2.65) looks for his third straight win Wednesday afternoon against Pirates RHP Trevor Williams (1-4, 3.70).

His team gave up a goal he felt shouldn't have counted three minutes into the opening period and had a subsequent equalizer called back on a razor-thin offside challenge.

Down 1-0 in the series and playing well, Tampa Bay then grabbed its first lead in more than 110 minutes of action midway through the third period only to see Boston tie it up with under four minutes to go in regulation.

""Adversity strikes in the weirdest ways,"" Cooper said. ""You never know when it's going to happen.

""Sometimes you're just dealt ... a sandwich that doesn't taste very good, if you know what I mean.""

And deal with it they did.

Ondrej Palat scored at 4:40 of overtime as the Lightning defeated the Bruins 4-3 to even their second-round playoff series 1-1.

Blake Coleman added two goals in regulation for the Lightning, while Nikita Kucherov had the other. Andrei Vasilevskiy made 22 saves to get the win.

""If there was one message that was going on it was we liked everything that was going on about the game,"" Cooper said. ""I know it sounds so cliche, but we just had to stick with it. Some teams, if you have mental weakness at all, you're probably sitting there saying, 'Poor us.'

""But it's just not been this group. That's not how they operate.""

Brad Marchand buried his second of the night to tie things with under four minutes left in the third period for the Bruins, while Nick Ritchie also scored. David Pastrnak added two assists for Boston, which got 36 stops from Jaroslav Halak.

The teams don't have much time to digest the result, with Game 3 of the best-of-seven matchup set for Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET back inside the fan-less Scotiabank Arena.

Tampa, which beat the Columbus Blue Jackets in quintuple overtime of Game 1 in the opening round before closing out the series in the extra period of Game 5 on a pair of goals from Brayden Point, got the winner after Boston couldn't clear its zone.

Patrick Maroon tried a wraparound that Halak stopped, but Palat was there to bury the rebound to score his first of the post-season and send the Lightning pouring off their bench in celebration.

""It's obviously big-time frustrating any time you lose a game and especially in that fashion,"" Bruins centre Sean Kuraly said. ""We thought we were trending in the right direction, (thinking) momentum may be swinging our way. You get the puck close to the blue line a couple times and you don't get it out, and against a good team that's what happens.

""It ends up in the back of your net.""

Acquired prior to February's trade deadline from the New Jersey Devils, Coleman gave Tampa its first lead of the series at 10:40 of the third after taking a stretch pass from Victor Hedman. The Lightning centre moved in alone on Halak and snuck an off-speed shot through the five-hole after getting slashed by Bruins defenceman Connor Clifton.

Boston, however, responded with 3:58 left in regulation when Marchand finished off a pretty passing play. With the Bruins in the middle of a change — Patrice Bergeron would normally be on the ice — Kuraly took a feed from Pastrnak and quickly found Marchand to bury his sixth and knot things up.

The Bruins, who triumphed 3-2 in Game 1 on the back of Halak's 35-save performance, took a 2-1 lead with 5:27 left in the second on a power play when Pastrnak faked a one-timer before sliding a pass to Marchand at the side of the net.

Tampa responded 56 seconds later after some great work from Point. The diminutive centre twisted and turned in the Bruins zone before finding Kevin Shattenkirk, whose shot was tipped in by Kucherov for his third.

The Lightning dressed seven defencemen with Ryan McDonagh (undisclosed), who has averaged a team-high 26:07 of ice time in the post-season, out injured after leaving midway through the third period of Game 1. Veteran blue-liners Luke Schenn and Braydon Coburn drew in, while Carter Verhaeghe was scratched up front.

Boston owned the best record in the NHL when the league suspended its season because of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, but dropped to the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference after losing all three of its games in the round-robin portion of the restart.

The Bruins found their groove in the first round of the usual 16-team playoff bracket, disposing of the Carolina Hurricanes in five games.

Tampa, meanwhile, had the second-best mark in the East and was fourth overall when the schedule was halted. The Lightning finished second in the round-robin and then downed Columbus.

The Bruins jumped out to a 1-0 lead at 3:14 of Tuesday's first period after Tampa defenceman Zach Bogosian's stick disintegrated at the offensive blue line. Boston broke the other way, with Ritchie stuffing his first past Vasilevskiy, who thought he had the puck covered — much to Cooper's chagrin.

The Lightning responded a couple minutes later when Barclay Goodrow tipped Coburn's point shot up and over Halak. The Bruins, however, correctly challenged for offside after Point was a fraction of a second too slow exiting the Boston zone on the tag up.

Cooper fired a number of expletives at the officials when the call was reversed, but was back smiling on the bench after a surprising burst from an unlikely source eventually knotted the score.

Bogosian, a bruising blue-liner known mostly for his physical play, split two Boston defenders, and as he was getting knocked down fed a diving Coleman, who slid his second past Halak before crashing into the net at 12:42.

""I saw Bogo picking up some speed,"" Coleman said. ""He just kind of had that look in his eye like he was about to do something. I just made it a point to get up into play with him, try to give him an option.

""He made a heck of a play.""

It was also the first sign the Lightning weren't going to be fazed by that early adversity.

""Any time there's a mishap, you just turn the page,"" Cooper said of his roster. ""It was needed tonight, I'll tell you that, because they need to be rewarded for the work they were doing.

""And in the end, they were.""

... Hardaway and Morris were called for double technicals in the second quarter.","LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — Paul George finally found his way.

The All-Star guard scored 35 points and the Los Angeles Clippers rolled past the Dallas Mavericks 154-111 on Tuesday night to take a 3-2 lead in their first-round Western Conference playoff series.

George had shot 29% in the series and endured fans' wrath on social media. He said he spoke to the team psychiatrist before Game 5.

""I mean, whatever it was, the bubble got the best of me,"" George said. ""I was just in a dark place. I really wasn’t here. I checked out. The past couple of games, it was just difficult.""

George said it didn't feel like the playoffs until his teammates decided to create the atmosphere that was lacking inside the NBA's Walt Disney World bubble.

""I came in with that mindset that this is Staples, we’re at home,"" he said. ""The place is packed. I really had to psych myself up. I thought the whole team took that and we ran with it. We created our own energy. We decided to dictate this game.""

Kawhi Leonard scored 32 points and Montrezl Harrell added 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers, who set a franchise record for points in a playoff game. Los Angeles can clinch the series on Thursday.

Dallas' Luka Doncic, who hit a game-winner at the buzzer in Game 4 to cap off a 43-point triple-double, was held to 22 points on 6-for-17 shooting.

Dallas coach Rick Carlisle was ejected in the third quarter of the testy game, which included six technicals and a flagrant-1 foul.

Doncic said Clippers forward Marcus Morris might have stepped on his ankle intentionally early in the third quarter.

""I don’t want to talk to him,"" Doncic said. ""He’s just saying a lot of bad stuff to me all the game. I don’t want to talk to him. I’ve just got to move on. Like I said, everybody’s going to have their own opinion. I just hope it wasn’t intentional. If that was intentional, that’s very bad.""

Mavericks centre Kristaps Porzingis sat out with right knee soreness. It was the second straight game the 7-foot-3 Latvian missed.

Leonard scored 22 points and Paul George scored 18 to help Los Angeles take a 76-52 lead at halftime. The Clippers shot 61% in the first half and led by as many as 27 points.

The Clippers continued the onslaught in the second half, bumping the lead to as many as 45 points.

""Tough game,"" Carlisle said. ""Very poor performance by us. It was disappointing. It was very physical. We just need to have a stronger physical disposition to start the game and throughout. We’ve got to get some more traction at both ends of the floor.""

TIP-INS

Mavericks: Doncic was issued a technical foul in the second quarter. ... G Tim Hardaway Jr. was called for a flagrant-1 after winding up and hitting George in the face on a drive. ... Assistant Stephen Silas took over as coach after Carlisle was ejected.

Clippers: Shot 67% from the field in the first quarter. ... Hardaway and Morris were called for double technicals in the second quarter. C Ivica Zubac was called for a technical in the third.

BIGGER THAN BASKETBALL

Clippers coach Doc Rivers was emotional while discussing the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which has sparked national outrage and some violent protests. Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back while his three children watched.

""That video, if you watch that video — you don’t need to be Black to be outraged,"" Rivers said. ""You need to be American and outraged. How dare the Republicans talk about fear. We’re the ones that need to be scared. We’re the ones having to talk to every Black child. What white father has to give his son a talk about being careful if you get pulled over? It’s just ridiculous. It keeps going. There’s no charges. Breonna Taylor — no charges. Nothing. All we’re asking is you live up to the Constitution. That’s all we’re asking -- for everybody. For everyone.""

CARLISLE'S EJECTION

Carlisle described what led to his ejection. Hardaway had the ball at the free-throw line, and then Rivers was granted a timeout.

""My understanding in that situation is that once a shooter has the ball, a timeout cannot be called by the opposing coach,"" Carlisle said. ""I thought the call was wrong. So I was asking about it and wasn’t getting a great explanation and then it turned into a technical and then another technical. I’m just standing up for my team.""

UP NEXT

Game 6 is Thursday.

Over the years, Canadian athletes and players on Canadian teams have brought attention to social and political issues with actions on and off the field of play.

Here is a look at some notable moments with Canadian connections:

JACKIE ROBINSON

Brooklyn Dodgers president Branch Rickey stood strong behind the first Black player to play in the major leagues, with Robinson breaking the colour barrier at the top level of the sport when he made his debut in 1947. Robinson was named rookie of the year that season.

A year before that, Brooklyn assigned Robinson to the Montreal Royals, its triple-A affiliate. In April 1946, Robinson became the first Black player to play in a minor-league game when Montreal faced Jersey City. The Royals went on to win the International League title that year.

In 2011, U.S. diplomats unveiled a commemorative plaque at the apartment Robinson and his wife Rachel called home in the summer of 1946.

""You can't make (enough) of the house because it's where the experiment started and the experiment went on to be a national success, so it led to something,"" Rachel Robinson said.

""What was nourished there in that house … had widespread influence in our society.""

1980 MOSCOW OLYMPICS

Canada was one of 66 countries to boycott the 1980 Summer Games because of Soviet-Afghan war.

The decision left just 80 countries in the Olympics.

Canada's call didn't sit well with all of the country's athletes. Former pentathlete Diane Jones-Konihowski was critical of the decision.

Jones-Konihowski, a 69-year-old Vancouver native now living in Calgary, doesn't regret her actions.

""I don't... because it (the boycott) was wrong,"" she said. ""We were still trading wheat with Russia, we were still having Aeroflot planes land (in Canada).

""Suddenly we were a priority with the federal government. We'd never been before... and so I was very, very angry.""

CARLOS DELGADO

In protest of American wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the then-Toronto Blue Jays slugger exited the field during the playing of ""God Bless America"" in the seventh inning of games starting in the 2004 season.

There were brief chants of ""USA! USA!"" when he lined out in the top of the seventh at Yankee Stadium during one game in 2004. During a moment of silence before ""God Bless America"" was played during the seventh-inning stretch, derisive shouts were made in his direction.

The native of Puerto Rico started standing for ""God Bless America"" again when he was traded to the New York Mets before the 2006 season.

""I gave him my views on that subject and I also said I would not put myself in front of the team,"" Delgado said. ""The Mets have a policy that everybody should stand for 'God Bless America' and I will be there. I will not cause any distractions to the ballclub.""

PHOENIX SUNS

During a playoff game in 2010, the Suns, led by Victoria's Steve Nash, wore ""Los Suns"" on their jersey.

The decision to wear the jerseys on the Cinco de Mayo holiday came after a law was passed by the Arizona Legislature and signed by Gov. Jan Brewer that drew widespread criticism from Latino organizations and civil rights groups, feeling it could lead to racial profiling of Hispanics.

""I think it’s fantastic,"" Nash said of ""Los Suns.""

""I think the law is very misguided. I think it's, unfortunately, to the detriment of our society and our civil liberties. I think it's very important for us to stand up for things we believe in. As a team and as an organization, we have a lot of love and support for all of our fans. The league is very multicultural. We have players from all over the world, and our Latino community here is very strong and important to us.""

WNBA PROTESTS

All players from the Indiana Fever, inclduing Natalie Achonwa of Guelph, Ont., knelt and locked arms during the anthem before a 2016 playoff game, following similar protests by NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.

This summer, all Seattle Storm and New York Liberty players walked off the court as the national anthem was played before a game. Longtime Canadian national team star Kia Nurse of Hamilton plays for the Liberty.

The WNBA said in a pre-season press release that all aspects of the game and player outfitting would be dedicated to Black Lives Matter and to honour victims of police brutality and racial injustice.

""That's the most important thing about this season, bringing awareness to the injustices that are going on throughout the whole world really, just having these conversations, bringing light to what's going on . . . being leaders in that aspect,"" Minnesota Lynx forward Bridget Carleton of Chatham, Ont., said.

NWSL PROTEST

The first team professional sport to return to the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic made a statement on its opening weekend.

National Women's Soccer League players from the Portland Thorns and North Carolina Courage knelt during the American anthem in late June as the Challenge Cup tournament opened on national television in Utah.

Longtime Canadian national team star Christine Sinclair of Burnaby, B.C., is a member of the Thorns. Goalkeeper Stephanie Labbe plays for the Courage.

""We took a knee today to protest racial injustice, police brutality and systemic racism against Black people and people of colour in America. We love our country and we have taken this opportunity to hold it to a higher standard. It is our duty to demand that the liberties and freedoms this nation was founded upon are extended to everyone,"" the Thorns and Courage said in a joint statement released before the game.

MATT DUMBA

On the opening day of the NHL's restart during the COVID-19 pandemic in Edmonton earlier this month, the Regina-born Dumba made a speech calling for social and racial justice before kneeling for the American anthem prior to an Edmonton Oilers-Chicago Blackhawks game.

""It was to shed light on the people who've lived through injustice and oppression, especially in my home state of Minnesota,"" the Minnesota Wild defenceman said.

Dumba then raised his fist for both the American and Canadian anthems during his team's first game the next day.

A day after that, four players from the Dallas Stars and Vegas Golden Knights knelt for the anthems.

On the eve of the Raptors' second-round playoff series opener against Boston, the discussion continued to be about how the teams can protest systemic racism and police brutality against Black people.

There is heartache and frustration.

Amplifying messages about racial injustice was a theme of the NBA's restart in the bubble at Walt Disney World, but after the shooting of Jacob Blake last weekend, players are fed up.

""It just feels like we're stuck. It feels like things are not changing. It feels like we're not doing anything productive, basically. That's how it feels,"" said Raptors forward Pascal Siakam. ""Those things hurt. I don't care where you're from . . . just seeing that and just knowing that every day it happens and it feels normal, just seeing Black men being shot every day, that hurts, man.""

The 26-year-old Siakam said he wouldn't watch the video of Blake being shot multiple times in the back by police in Wisconsin.

The Raptors' all-star said watching the death of George Floyd on video — Floyd died after a white police officer pressed his knee against Floyd's neck on May 25 — had traumatized him.

The Raptors have been at the forefront of the NBA's social justice initiatives, arriving to the league's Walt Disney World campus earlier this summer in buses with ""Black Lives Matter"" written in huge block letters, and asking for justice for Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black people who have been killed by police. They've knelt for both the American and Canadian anthems before games.

Raptors coach Nick Nurse says the idea of a boycott ""is on the table"" after players from his team and the Celtics met Tuesday night. Other ideas have also been discussed, he said.

Nurse, who was recently named NBA coach of the year, said he can only listen to his players, and supports whatever decision they make.

""I'm trying to give them a forum to talk as much and often as I can. I'm trying to respect their priorities, and also give them some of my own personal thoughts,"" Nurse, wearing an orange WNBA hoodie, said on his Zoom media availability.

""I've had couple very deep, personal discussions with these guys here this morning about playing, not playing, being in the bubble, leaving the bubble, coming to the bubble. All these things and I just give them my own personal opinion on it.""

He has heard of his players discussing going home, but doesn't know if ""that's a team-wide thing.""

This fight is personal for the Raptors.

Last week, video emerged of a law enforcement officer shoving Masai Ujiri as the team president tried to get on the court following the Toronto's title-clinching win over the Golden State Warriors last year in Oakland, Calif.

The video was part of a countersuit, following a lawsuit by Alameda County sheriff's deputy Alan Strickland.

""I think that we've got some pretty conscientious guys,"" Nurse said. ""We obviously have the footage and the situation with Masai, and our team just saw that recently as well, so there is some personal-ness to this.""

The day before the Raptors tip off what is expected to be a much tougher series than their 4-0 opening-round sweep of Brooklyn, Siakam was asked if it's difficult to focus on playing basketball amidst the dark cloud of racial injustice.

""There's really a lot of things that are way bigger than basketball going on,"" he said. ""You want to be able to play, you want to be able to, because at the end of the day, we know that basketball brings something to people. But at the same time, just seeing that happening every day, man, it's tough. It hurts. . . yeah, it hurts.""

The Celtics, who swept their first-round series with Philadelphia, echoed the Raptors' thoughts of frustration.

""We're over here, guys are crying, guys are hurting right now because of what's going on,"" said Boston forward Grant Williams. ""You never know if that's your brother. What if that was my cousin? What if that was my family member? That's something that weighs down on you.""

Celtics forward Jayson Tatum said the discussion to boycott started with the Raptors, but that players on other teams are also talking about it. The Celtics forward knows people will ask: What is sitting out going to do?

""Obviously if we sit out a game or the rest of the playoffs, we understand how big of an impact that will have,"" he said. ""Everybody's going to have to talk about it, continue to raise awareness. We don't want to just keep playing and forget about what's going on in the outside world, because it’s affecting us. We're more than just basketball players, we're people. And we have these raw emotions and feelings.""

Before gathering in Florida for the NBA's restart, Tatum pointed out that players were able to be on the front lines to protest, and many of them did, including Raptors' point guard Kyle Lowry. Now there's a feeling of being trapped in the bubble.

""We're in this bubble and we're isolated from everyone else and that's frustrating,"" the Celtics forward said. ""I know some guys have talked about going home.""

Being a Black man in America, Tatum said, is ""more important than what I do on the basketball court. . .When you think of a man getting shot seven times in the back with his kids in the car, that's way more important.""

Boston coach Brad Stevens said he hasn't heard much talk from his team on potentially boycotting games. He said the Celtics have met to allow players to speak about their feelings.

""I just simply said, each individual, we support 110 per cent,"" Stevens said. ""This is not easy. From the standpoint of being down here and feeling like you're in this place that you can't leave. . . totally understand anybody's reaction to what's going on outside of here and the desire to do more. Or the desire to not play. Or the desire to leave.""

On the court, Nurse said Lowry did not practise Wednesday.

The six-time all-star guard suffered an ankle sprain when he stepped on the foot of Chris Chiozza late in the first quarter of Toronto's 150-122 series-clinching rout of Brooklyn on Sunday night. He is considered day-to-day.

An incorrect name for the CP Women's Open appeared in a previous version.","Aaron Cockerill is really getting to know his caddie Stuart Beck this season on the European Tour. It's the deep kind of familiarity that can only come from a long road trip.

Cockerill, from Stony Mountain, Man., is the lone Canadian on the European Tour and will be start play in the U.K. Championship just outside of Birmingham, England, on Thursday. It's the sixth consecutive event he's played in Britain, essentially giving him a six-week trip around England and Wales, driving from tournament to tournament with Beck.

article continues below

""Lots of time together. He's probably getting sick of me,"" said Cockerill with a laugh. ""They've created a pod system within (the Euro Tour's) bubble so you can only eat dinner with your caddie and one other player and their caddie, so you can only hang out with a couple of people all week.""

Cockerill noted that even within his small dining pod — he and Beck have been eating with American Johannes Veerman recently — the tables are ""hilariously"" far apart.

The life on the road is a product of the Euro Tour's approach to COVID-19 safety protocols. Instead of playing in a different country each week, the tour has created multi-week swings through one country at a time. There are several benefits to the new system, including the tour booking all the accommodations for the golfers to ensure they remain within their bubble. It also means the golfers have fewer travel documents to sort out.

""Last year you'd finish a tournament and then fly what seemed like halfway around the world and a few time zones over,"" said Cockerill. ""Honestly, it's been great because it's just been so much easier. ... It's really simple. You just show up and play golf.""

Cockerill tied for 53rd at the British Masters on July 25, missed the cut at the English Open on Aug. 2, tied for 26th at the English Championship on Aug. 9, and tied for 14th at the Celtic Classic on Aug. 16.

A tie for 53rd at the Wales Open on Sunday moved him up four spots in the Race to Dubai rankings, placing him in 152nd heading into play on Thursday. The top 110 cards keep their cards next season.

""It's been fun but it's also been five weeks in a row and I'm starting to get tired,"" said Cockerill, who plans to skip the European Tour's swing through the Iberian peninsula. ""I'm looking forward to getting home.""

After a few weeks back home — Cockerill and his fiancee just purchased a new home in Winnipeg — he plans on returning to Great Britain for the Euro Tour's second circuit, this time with stops in Northern Ireland, Scotland and England.

PGA TOUR — Mackenzie Hughes of Dundas, Ont., was named Golf Canada's player of the week after tying for 13th at the Northern Trust. That moved him up to 36th in the FedEx Cup standings, making him the highest ranked Canadian at this week's BMW Championship at Olympia Field Country Club's North Course in Illinois. He'll be joined by Adam Hadwin and Nick Taylor of Abbotsford, B.C., as well as Corey Conners of Listowel, Ont., in the field. The top 30 in the standings move on to next week's Tour Championship in Atlanta.

KORN FERRY TOUR — Taylor Pendrith of Richmond Hill, Ont., is the highest ranked Canadian at this week's Korn Ferry Tour Championship at Victoria National Golf Club in Newburgh, Ind. He's No. 4 on the second-tier circuit. Ben Silverman of Thornhill, Ont., Adam Svensson of Surrey, B.C., and Vancouver's Stuart Macdonald will also be playing.

LPGA TOUR — Brooke Henderson of Smiths Falls, Ont., hopes to rebound after missing the cut at last week's Women's British Open when she plays at this week's NW Arkansas Championship at Pinnacle Country Club in Rogers, Ark., starting Friday. Hamilton's Alena Sharp and Calgary's Jaclyn Lee are also in the field.

CP WOMEN'S OPEN — Golf Canada announced Wednesday its annual LPGA Tour stop will return to the Ottawa Hunt and Golf Club for the fourth time in August 2022. The club is about an hour from Henderson's hometown. More than 50,000 attended the CP Women's Open the last time it was held at Ottawa Hunt in 2017, with Henderson in contention entering the final round. The 2021 event will be at Shaughnessy Golf and Country Club in Vancouver after it was cancelled at that club this year.

Bo Horvat scored twice, and Tyler Toffoli and Elias Pettersson each had a goal and two assists as the Canucks defeated the Golden Knights 5-2 at Rogers Place.

The best-of-seven second-round series is tied 1-1. Game 3 goes Thursday.

Forty-eight hours earlier, the Golden Knights, now 8-2 in the post-season, had manhandled the Canucks en route to a 5-0 pounding in Game 1.

""For us as a team we wanted to bounce back from Game 1. We weren't happy with that,"" said Pettersson.

""We played a good game. We should be happy about it but (we need) a short-term memory and be ready for Game 3.""

Goaltender Jacob Markstrom made 38 saves for the win while Robin Lehner stopped 22 shots for Vegas. It's the first time Vegas has allowed more than five goals in a game in the return-to-play tournament.

It was the first game back for Toffoli since the opening game of the qualifying round against the Minnesota Wild on Aug. 2. The NHL is not releasing information on injuries, but Toffoli had been seen in a walking boot.

Toffoli jumped over the boards for his first shift in the first period and scored nine seconds later, taking a cross-crease pass from Pettersson to put the puck into a yawning net. He then made it 2-0 on the power play, delivering a tape-to-tape pass to an incoming Horvat, who blasted it past Lehner.

""It's fun to get back in the lineup and get a big win and tie this series up,"" said Toffoli, who had been acquired at the trade deadline from the Los Angeles Kings. He had put up 10 points in his first 10 games with the Canucks before the regular season ended March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""I made some phone calls yesterday, talked to a lot of people. It was a busy day,"" said Toffoli. ""It was good obviously getting the OK from everybody (to play). I got all excited. Felt like I was coming back to my first playoff series.""

Vancouver coach Travis Green said the 5-0 loss was their worst game of the playoffs and that Game 2 was a must-win.

""You go down two (games) against that team early in the series it would be tough and just mentally, too (to come back),"" he said.

""We were better with the puck, played a more direct game. I thought we were better on our feet, quicker. That's a good hockey team. I thought we did a good job of making them defend more than we did the first game.""

Despite being down by two goals in the second period, the Golden Knights looked like they were going to run the Canucks out of the rink again.

Markstrom kept the Canucks alive as Vegas tilted the ice and turned his net into a shooting gallery, blasting away for 22 shots in the period. Vegas got one goal back from Alex Tuch before Pettersson scored on a cross-ice feed from Alex Edler to make it 3-1 heading into the third.

""That really was a back-breaker,"" said Vegas head coach Peter DeBoer. ""You're down 3-1 and you have nothing to show for the work you put in to try and get back in the game.""

Tuch added: ""We knew Vancouver wasn't happy with the way they played last game and we knew they were going to come out flying. And we decided instead of being prepared, (to) be surprised by that for some reason.""

Vancouver iced the game 18 seconds into the third on Horvat's second goal. Then the frustration finally got to Vegas.

First, Max Pacioretty grabbed J.T. Miller by the head and threw him down after the whistle for a roughing penalty. Tuch got a double minor for pummelling Jake Virtanen while the Vancouver forward lay on the ice.

Pacioretty scored late for Vegas and Tanner Pearson added the final Vancouver goal into an empty net.

Horvat had not found the scoresheet since scoring two goals in each of the first two games against the St. Louis Blues in the first round.

Pettersson has been a steady point-getter throughout the playoffs but had been shut down by Vegas in Game 1, limited to no shots on net and one blocked shot.

Markstrom, in his first playoff series, has been the locomotive pulling the Canucks' playoff train. He allowed just nine goals on 121 shots (.926 save percentage) against Minnesota in the first round while registering his first playoff shutout. He saved 29 of 34 against the Blues (.930).

The series is being played at a fan-less Rogers Place. Players are isolating between contests to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The All-Star guard scored 35 points and the Los Angeles Clippers rolled past the Dallas Mavericks 154-111 on Tuesday night to take a 3-2 lead in their first-round Western Conference playoff series.

George had shot 29% in the series and endured fans' wrath on social media. He said he spoke to the team psychiatrist before Game 5.

""I mean, whatever it was, the bubble got the best of me,"" George said. ""I was just in a dark place. I really wasn’t here. I checked out. The past couple of games, it was just difficult.""

George said it didn't feel like the playoffs until his teammates decided to create the atmosphere that was lacking inside the NBA's Walt Disney World bubble.

""I came in with that mindset that this is Staples, we’re at home,"" he said. ""The place is packed. I really had to psych myself up. I thought the whole team took that and we ran with it. We created our own energy. We decided to dictate this game.""

Kawhi Leonard scored 32 points and Montrezl Harrell added 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers, who set a franchise record for points in a playoff game. Los Angeles can clinch the series on Thursday.

Dallas' Luka Doncic, who hit a game-winner at the buzzer in Game 4 to cap off a 43-point triple-double, was held to 22 points on 6-for-17 shooting.

Dallas coach Rick Carlisle was ejected in the third quarter of the testy game, which included six technicals and a flagrant-1 foul.

Doncic said Clippers forward Marcus Morris might have stepped on his ankle intentionally early in the third quarter.

""I don’t want to talk to him,"" Doncic said. ""He’s just saying a lot of bad stuff to me all the game. I don’t want to talk to him. I’ve just got to move on. Like I said, everybody’s going to have their own opinion. I just hope it wasn’t intentional. If that was intentional, that’s very bad.""

Mavericks centre Kristaps Porzingis sat out with right knee soreness. It was the second straight game the 7-foot-3 Latvian missed.

Leonard scored 22 points and Paul George scored 18 to help Los Angeles take a 76-52 lead at halftime. The Clippers shot 61% in the first half and led by as many as 27 points.

The Clippers continued the onslaught in the second half, bumping the lead to as many as 45 points.

""Tough game,"" Carlisle said. ""Very poor performance by us. It was disappointing. It was very physical. We just need to have a stronger physical disposition to start the game and throughout. We’ve got to get some more traction at both ends of the floor.""

TIP-INS

Mavericks: Doncic was issued a technical foul in the second quarter. ... G Tim Hardaway Jr. was called for a flagrant-1 after winding up and hitting George in the face on a drive. ... Assistant Stephen Silas took over as coach after Carlisle was ejected.

Clippers: Shot 67% from the field in the first quarter. ... Hardaway and Morris were called for double technicals in the second quarter. C Ivica Zubac was called for a technical in the third.

BIGGER THAN BASKETBALL

Clippers coach Doc Rivers was emotional while discussing the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which has sparked national outrage and some violent protests. Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back while his three children watched.

""That video, if you watch that video — you don’t need to be Black to be outraged,"" Rivers said. ""You need to be American and outraged. How dare the Republicans talk about fear. We’re the ones that need to be scared. We’re the ones having to talk to every Black child. What white father has to give his son a talk about being careful if you get pulled over? It’s just ridiculous. It keeps going. There’s no charges. Breonna Taylor — no charges. Nothing. All we’re asking is you live up to the Constitution. That’s all we’re asking -- for everybody. For everyone.""

CARLISLE'S EJECTION

Carlisle described what led to his ejection. Hardaway had the ball at the free-throw line, and then Rivers was granted a timeout.

""My understanding in that situation is that once a shooter has the ball, a timeout cannot be called by the opposing coach,"" Carlisle said. ""I thought the call was wrong. So I was asking about it and wasn’t getting a great explanation and then it turned into a technical and then another technical. I’m just standing up for my team.""

Moments later, the Chicago White Sox right-hander threw the final pitch in a truly bizarre performance.

article continues below

A no-fan no-no.

With the seats at Guaranteed Rate Field empty, Giolito pitched the first no-hitter of the pandemic-delayed season, striking out 13 in leading the White Sox over the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 Tuesday night.

""2020 has been a very strange year,"" said Giolito, who conducted a postgame interview while wearing a mask. ""Obviously a lot of weird stuff going on with COVID and the state of the world, so may as well throw this in the mix.""

Sounds like he didn't mind that nobody saw it. Well, almost no one.

After right fielder Adam Engel extended on the run to catch Erik Gonzalez’s slicing drive toward the line for the final out, the hollers of Giolito’s teammates in the middle of the diamond echoed around the stadium.

""I’m just stoked for Lucas and so happy and ecstatic and emotional for Lucas,"" Engel said. ""It stinks we couldn’t celebrate the way most no-hitters get celebrated.""

The smallest crowd listed for any no-hitter in the majors over the last 100 years came in 1944, when a mere 1,014 watched Cincinnati’s Clyde Shoun beat the Braves at Crosley Field.

Nowhere close to that number on this night, not with the park that holds over 40,000 closed to fans because of virus protocols.

Suffice to say, years from now when White Sox fans fondly remember Giolito’s gem, there will not be, say, 100,000 or so people claiming they were there to see it in person.

At one point early in the game, some members of grounds crew drifted in sight, but that was about it outside of the teams.

An All-Star last year, the 26-year-old Giolito (3-2) matched his career high for strikeouts set in his previous start against Detroit.

Only a four-pitch walk to Gonzalez leading off the fourth inning got in Giolito’s way of perfection. That was only runner he permitted while throwing 101 pitches

""I’ve been working for this type of game for a while now and it’s really cool that we got it done,"" Giolito said.

Giolito relied on his changeup and fastball to make quick work of the Pirates, who came into the game batting just .229 and have the worst record in the majors. Six of their starters finished the game hitting under .199 this season.

The White Sox rushed toward the mound after the final out in Giolito’s first career no-hitter. Giolito hugged catcher James McCann as the Chicago players joined the party.

The South Side of Chicago normally rattles with fireworks after a home win -- this is the club that gave the game the exploding scoreboard -- but the park remained silent as the dugout emptied.

Giolito, meanwhile, was locked in his own zone in the later innings, fully aware of what was at stake.

""After the seventh, six more outs, looking at who I was facing, became very, very, very possible,"" he said, ""and then we were able to get it done.""

Giolito said his approach never wavered.

""Just staying with the same, like, mental routine for every single pitch. One pitch at a time. Full focus, full execution, straight through the target,"" he said.

Giolito pitched the 19th no-hitter in White Sox history — second most to the Dodgers' 23 — and first since Philip Humber threw a perfect game at Seattle in 2012. This was the seventh time the Pirates have been held hitless, with Washington’s Max Scherzer having done it in 2015.

White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson made a nifty play on a grounder by Bryan Reynolds up the middle in the seventh to preserve the gem, helped by first baseman Jose Abreu’s stretch at the bag.

In the ninth, Gonzalez hit a liner that Engel, a fleet centre fielder for most of his career, caught on the run at knee-high height.

""Yeah man, I think I got it,"" Gonzalez said. ""With that at-bat, I was a little bit mad because I don’t want to be part of history.""

Giolito improved to 30-28 in his big league career. He made his debut with Washington in 2016, then was traded after that season to the White Sox in a package for outfielder Adam Eaton.

Giolito gave up a major league-high 118 earned runs in 2018, his first full season in Chicago.

""I was pretty much bottom of the league in almost every stat,"" Giolito said. ""I kind of had to ... learn from failure to learn my true potential.""

He added: ""I always envisioned that I’d throw a no-hitter in the big leagues.""

Giolito threw the first no-hitter at Guaranteed Rate Field since Minnesota’s Francisco Liriano did it in 2011.

The White Sox, who’ve won eight of their last nine, ended the Pirates’ season-best winning streak at three games.

Giolito was dominant in his previous start, too, fanning 13 against Detroit and allowing just three hits in seven innings. The victory over Pittsburgh was his third career shutout.

Chicago’s first three batters reached in the second and all three came home one at a time after Engel’s groundout and singles Anderson and Eloy Jimenez. McCann added a sacrifice fly in the third off Steven Brault (0-1).

TRAINER’S ROOM

Pirates: RH reliever Keone Kela was available to pitch after leaving Friday’s loss to Milwaukee with forearm tightness. … Infielders Colin Moran (collision) and Kevin Newman (abdomen) also were on the bench after leaving Sunday’s game.

White Sox: McCann stayed in the game after being struck near his left hand by a second-inning pitch from Brault. ... Jimenez appeared to be getting treatment near the mound after the celebration, but manager Rick Renteria said he walked off under his own power.

The judges scored it 30-26, 30-27 and 29-28 for Romero. But White pointed out that the 23-year-old from Welland, Ont., failed to finish his damaged opponent and had trouble when Breeden switched to southpaw.

""He's 23 years old, he's a young kid. I absolutely positively think he's going to be in the UFC some day. Just not tonight,"" said White.

The 31-year-old Breeden (8-3-0) got Romero's attention late in the round with a knee to the head but was limping as he went back to his corner.

Breeden's leg buckled repeatedly in the third as Romero kept lashing him with kicks. But despite the damage from 25 kicks in total, Breeden kept coming forward and swinging.

""Those calf kicks were nasty,"" said Romero. ""My legs are actually hurting from them so you know they're pretty hard.""

Playing their first game in exactly one month, the Montreal Impact (3-2-1) came away with a 2-0 victory over the Vancouver Whitecaps (2-6-0) on Tuesday night in front of 250 spectators.

article continues below

The Impact became Canada's first professional sports team to play in front of fans since the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted MLS play in March.

""It's better than when there's no one,"" said Henry. ""We heard them. They encouraged us. It was important to have them. They supported the players until the very end.

""There's nothing better than having fans in the stadium.""

The crowd of 250 — the maximum permitted inside Saputo Stadium under Quebec's public-health guidelines — were scattered across eight separate stands in the 20,801-seat venue.

Though pre-recorded fan noise from the stadium's speakers sometimes drowned them out, the few fans made themselves heard when Montreal took an early lead.

Missed coverage by Vancouver on the left wing gave Saphir Taider yards of space in the 18th minute. The midfielder delivered a lovely out-swinging cross with the outside of his boot into the box to Romell Quioto, who headed it home.

A deep ball by Emanuel Maciel found the speedy Lassi Lappalainen behind the Whitecaps' back line in the 40th. Lappalainen let the ball settle down before coolly firing into the far corner of the net, out of goalkeeper Thomas Hasal's reach.

A fan rang the stadium bell after every goal.

""The cohesion was there, the chemistry for us was there,"" said midfielder Samuel Piette. ""There's a lot of stuff we need to work on, but I like the fact that when we have the ball, we try to play. We didn't just kick the ball forward and try to defend.

""We applied the game plan and they couldn't really find anything. It was hard for them to find any gaps and dangerous attacking spots to hurt us.""

Other supporters without tickets gathered outside the grounds, chanting, drumming and setting off smoke bombs.

""It's kind of cool to be one of the first to be part of a live event,"" season-ticket holder Maxime Theriault said before kickoff. ""It's like a private session or a private practice.""

Fans had their temperatures checked at the gate and were required to wear face masks at all times while inside the stadium.

""I never envisioned there would be any semblance of a season,"" said Impact supporter Dany Trudeau, who attended the game with his father. ""We still don't know what will happen with the American teams. Right now we're taking any games they'll give us.""

All players took a knee prior to kickoff in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Impact goalkeeper Clement Diop raised his fist in the air.

The Whitecaps struggled offensively in the first half despite seeing more of the ball.

Down 2-0, Vancouver had a chance to halve the deficit in the 50th minute when Derek Cornelius went down in the box after Zachary Brault-Guillard kicked his thigh.

Lucas Cavallini failed to get much power into his spot kick. Diop dived to his left for the easy save, on his way to his second clean sheet of the season.

Substitute Anthony Jackson-Hamel nearly added a third goal for Montreal but his header from six yards out skimmed the crossbar in the 87th minute.

The Whitecaps dropped their third straight game after being blanked twice by Toronto FC last week. They have failed to score a goal in their last 379 minutes of play.

""I'm sick of having the same conversations over and over when we're just getting the same result every single time,"" said Cornelius. ""It's frustrating.

""At the end of the day, we have to all take a serious look at ourselves in the mirror to see what we can all be better at so we can finally have something to show for. Because this is too much now.""

The three Canadian MLS teams are facing each other three times — for a combined nine games — while COVID-19 border restrictions complicate travel to and from the U.S.

The results count in the MLS standings. The best team after nine games will earn a spot in the Canadian Championship final against the winner of this season's Canadian Premier League.

Notes: Former Impact goalkeeper and Quebec native Maxime Crepeau (fractured left thumb) did not play for Vancouver. ... The Impact host Toronto FC on Friday night. Vancouver's next game is at home against TFC in two weeks.

Down 1-0 in the series and playing well, Tampa Bay then grabbed its first lead in more than 110 minutes of action midway through the third period only to see Boston tie it up with under four minutes to go in regulation.

""Adversity strikes in the weirdest ways,"" Cooper said. ""You never know when it's going to happen.

""Sometimes you're just dealt ... a sandwich that doesn't taste very good, if you know what I mean.""

And deal with it they did.

Ondrej Palat scored at 4:40 of overtime as the Lightning defeated the Bruins 4-3 to even their second-round playoff series 1-1.

Blake Coleman added two goals in regulation for the Lightning, while Nikita Kucherov had the other. Andrei Vasilevskiy made 22 saves to get the win.

""If there was one message that was going on it was we liked everything that was going on about the game,"" Cooper said. ""I know it sounds so cliche, but we just had to stick with it. Some teams, if you have mental weakness at all, you're probably sitting there saying, 'Poor us.'

""But it's just not been this group. That's not how they operate.""

Brad Marchand buried his second of the night to tie things with under four minutes left in the third period for the Bruins, while Nick Ritchie also scored. David Pastrnak added two assists for Boston, which got 36 stops from Jaroslav Halak.

The teams don't have much time to digest the result, with Game 3 of the best-of-seven matchup set for Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET back inside the fan-less Scotiabank Arena.

Tampa, which beat the Columbus Blue Jackets in quintuple overtime of Game 1 in the opening round before closing out the series in the extra period of Game 5 on a pair of goals from Brayden Point, got the winner after Boston couldn't clear its zone.

Patrick Maroon tried a wraparound that Halak stopped, but Palat was there to bury the rebound to score his first of the post-season and send the Lightning pouring off their bench in celebration.

""It's obviously big-time frustrating any time you lose a game and especially in that fashion,"" Bruins centre Sean Kuraly said. ""We thought we were trending in the right direction, (thinking) momentum may be swinging our way. You get the puck close to the blue line a couple times and you don't get it out, and against a good team that's what happens.

""It ends up in the back of your net.""

Acquired prior to February's trade deadline from the New Jersey Devils, Coleman gave Tampa its first lead of the series at 10:40 of the third after taking a stretch pass from Victor Hedman. The Lightning centre moved in alone on Halak and snuck an off-speed shot through the five-hole after getting slashed by Bruins defenceman Connor Clifton.

Boston, however, responded with 3:58 left in regulation when Marchand finished off a pretty passing play. With the Bruins in the middle of a change — Patrice Bergeron would normally be on the ice — Kuraly took a feed from Pastrnak and quickly found Marchand to bury his sixth and knot things up.

The Bruins, who triumphed 3-2 in Game 1 on the back of Halak's 35-save performance, took a 2-1 lead with 5:27 left in the second on a power play when Pastrnak faked a one-timer before sliding a pass to Marchand at the side of the net.

Tampa responded 56 seconds later after some great work from Point. The diminutive centre twisted and turned in the Bruins zone before finding Kevin Shattenkirk, whose shot was tipped in by Kucherov for his third.

The Lightning dressed seven defencemen with Ryan McDonagh (undisclosed), who has averaged a team-high 26:07 of ice time in the post-season, out injured after leaving midway through the third period of Game 1. Veteran blue-liners Luke Schenn and Braydon Coburn drew in, while Carter Verhaeghe was scratched up front.

Boston owned the best record in the NHL when the league suspended its season because of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, but dropped to the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference after losing all three of its games in the round-robin portion of the restart.

The Bruins found their groove in the first round of the usual 16-team playoff bracket, disposing of the Carolina Hurricanes in five games.

Tampa, meanwhile, had the second-best mark in the East and was fourth overall when the schedule was halted. The Lightning finished second in the round-robin and then downed Columbus.

The Bruins jumped out to a 1-0 lead at 3:14 of Tuesday's first period after Tampa defenceman Zach Bogosian's stick disintegrated at the offensive blue line. Boston broke the other way, with Ritchie stuffing his first past Vasilevskiy, who thought he had the puck covered — much to Cooper's chagrin.

The Lightning responded a couple minutes later when Barclay Goodrow tipped Coburn's point shot up and over Halak. The Bruins, however, correctly challenged for offside after Point was a fraction of a second too slow exiting the Boston zone on the tag up.

Cooper fired a number of expletives at the officials when the call was reversed, but was back smiling on the bench after a surprising burst from an unlikely source eventually knotted the score.

Bogosian, a bruising blue-liner known mostly for his physical play, split two Boston defenders, and as he was getting knocked down fed a diving Coleman, who slid his second past Halak before crashing into the net at 12:42.

""I saw Bogo picking up some speed,"" Coleman said. ""He just kind of had that look in his eye like he was about to do something. I just made it a point to get up into play with him, try to give him an option.

""He made a heck of a play.""

It was also the first sign the Lightning weren't going to be fazed by that early adversity.

""Any time there's a mishap, you just turn the page,"" Cooper said of his roster. ""It was needed tonight, I'll tell you that, because they need to be rewarded for the work they were doing.

""And in the end, they were.""

The Nuggets trail the sixth-seeded Jazz 3-2 with Game 6 on Thursday.

Murray, from Kitchener, Ont., was unstoppable down the stretch in nearly matching his 50-point effort in Game 4. He hit 17 of 26 shots and had eight assists, including a pass to Nikola Jokic for a 3-pointer with 23.6 seconds remaining that sealed the win.

""Whenever he’s like that we are winning the game or we are really close,"" said Jokic, who also didn't sub out in the second half. ""That’s what we need from him.""

The dynamic tandem of Murray and Jokic clearly weren't ready to leave the NBA bubble just yet. Jokic had it going early as he scored 21 of his 31 points in the the first quarter.

Murray took over late after his team fell behind by as many as 15 points in the third quarter.

""We’ve all got a will to win. Simple as that,"" explained Murray, who played through a bruise on his knee. ""That can carrying you. That can take you places.""

With the game tied at 101, Murray scored nine straight for Denver to put the Nuggets up by nine with 1:20 to go.

Donovan Mitchell finished with 30 points while wearing a pair of bright, multicolored shoes. The sharpshooter is averaging 37.6 points over the five games.

Reserve Jordan Clarkson added 17 points and Joe Ingles found his rhythm with 13. Ingles had a combined two points in the previous two games.

""I thought at some level, we just lost our composure when we were ahead,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. ""Oftentimes, when a team’s making a run you get a little distracted, and that’s when we have to come together even more. Our guys know that, and we’ll come out ready to play the next game.""

The Nuggets turned in their best third period of the series when they needed it most. Trailing 63-54 at halftime, they outscored the Jazz 28-23. Utah has dominated the third quarter by a 142-92 margin before Tuesday.

""This was a very important win for us to stay here and keep the series alive. We have to go out there and find a way to get a Game 6 and force a deciding Game 7,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""Jamal and Nikola will be the keys to us continuing doing that.""

TIP-INS

Jazz: Before the game, C Rudy Gobert had his two-year reign as the NBA’s Defensive Player of the Year come to an end with Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo winning the award. Gobert had 11 points and 12 rebounds.

Nuggets: F Michael Porter Jr. had 15 points and F Jerami Grant chipped in 13. ... Although G Gary Harris was upgraded to ""questionable"" for Game 5, that balky right hip sidelined him again. His last NBA game was March 11.

LOST FOCUS

Mike Conley said there's a lesson to be learned after the Jazz lost some of their focus with the lead.

""Not to let our minds get away from our task at hand,"" Conley said. ""The other team doesn’t care what’s going on in your mind. They’re going to keep pushing and keep going and keep fighting. That’s what teams like Denver do. They’re very good. They’re not going to lay down easy.""

HOT HAND

Jokic hit all five 3-pointers he took in the first quarter. He’s the third player in the series to have five in a quarter, joining Murray (fourth quarter in Game 4) and Mitchell (third in Game 2).

According to Basketball Reference, the playoff record for 3-pointers in a quarter is held by Antoine Walker. He had six by in the second quarter on April 28, 2002.

M & M SHOW

Murray and Mitchell keep turning in big performances. Mitchell has a pair of games in the series where he went for 50 or more points.

""It’s fun,"" Murray. ""Not focusing on it. But it’s hard to not notice.""

SOCIAL INJUSTICE

Before their walk-through Tuesday morning, Malone and the Nuggets talked about the situation with Jacob Blake, a Black man whose shooting by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Sunday has roiled the nation.

""I am wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt. Black Lives Matter is on the courts. But a T-shirt and a slogan on a court is obviously not doing anything to stop the vicious cycle that we’ve seen time and time again,"" Malone said.

He was 5 under after the front nine Tuesday at Ozarks National when he hit driver at the par-4 10th. The ball wound up in such heavy rough that Mickelson couldn't find it, forcing him to take a penalty stroke. He still wound up making a long putt to salvage bogey, and that gave him some momentum for the rest of the round.

""I was able to get right back to even par on the back side with a birdie on the next hole, and then I made a couple more coming in,"" said Mickelson, whose 7-under 64 left him 17 under.

That was good for a four-shot lead over Tim Petrovic and Rod Pampling, who will be his playing partners for the final round. Mike Weir of Bright's Grove, Ont., (69) was nine shots off the lead at 8 under.

""I've been putting really well,"" Mickelson said. ""Today I didn't drive it the way I've been driving it. I kind of a hung a few drives, so I'm going to the range and try to work on that now. But when I come out tomorrow I'll try to be a little bit more aggressive with the driver and see if I can make a few more birdies.""

A few more? He's already made 19 of them in his first 36 holes.

Playing in the final group and with the shadows getting long, Mickelson picked up right where he left off after his opening-round 61. He made birdie at the third and then rattled off three straight beginning at the par-4 fifth, where he nearly chipped in for eagle.

Petrovic tried to make a run at Mickelson, but even one of his career-low rounds only got him so close. His putter went cold down the stretch and a poor approach at the par-4 finishing hole resulted in bogey.

Mickelson added a bridie at the ninth, the only hole he bogeyed on Monday, after a pretty flop shot over the bunker. After the lost ball at the 10th, Mickelson responded by adding two more birdies.

The second of them at the par-3 12th was a backhanded tap-in. His approach shot barely carried onto the front edge of the green, then nestled up to about an inch from the hole.

Mickelson could still squander the lead in the final round Wednesday, when tee times were moved to the early morning because of expected bad weather in the afternoon. But given the quality of his short game through 36 holes, the more pressing question is whether he could break the PGA Tour Champions' 54-hole scoring record of 191 — shared by Bruce Fleisher, Loren Roberts, Bernhard Langer, David Frost and Rocco Mediate.

Mickelson, who decided to make his debut on the over-50 tour to continue his U.S. Open prep after he was eliminated from the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, would need to shoot 65 in his final round Wednesday to move atop the list.

Petrovic and Pampling each shot 64-65 over the first two rounds. Rocco Mediate struggled coming in and was at 12 under.

K.J. Choi was another shot back, and Steve Stricker and David McKenzie were at 10 under.

This was Williams’ fifth match since professional tennis resumed amid the coronavirus pandemic after a hiatus of nearly six months — and all five have gone three sets. She is 3-2 in that stretch.

The result against No. 13 seed Sakkari, and particularly the way the match ended, was hardly promising for Williams as the U.S. Open’s start approaches next week.

The Western & Southern Open is usually held in Ohio but was moved to the U.S. Open’s site in Flushing Meadows this year to make for a two-event, no-spectator ""bubble"" during the pandemic.

In men's play, Canada's Milos Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Andy Murray. Raonic, from Thornhill, Ont., is the last Canadian remaining in the draw.

Williams was seemingly in control early, serving for the first set at 5-3, 30-0, when things began to unravel. She missed two backhands in a row, then put a forehand into the net to set up a break point, and walked over to the stand holding her towel at the back of the court (the ball people normally handle towels for players, but not during COVID-19).

That’s when chair umpire Aurelie Tourte called a time violation. On the following point, Williams sailed a forehand long to get broken.

At the ensuing changeover, the 23-time Grand Slam champion argued with Tourte, saying: ""I mean, I’m getting my own towels. That’s not fair. You should tell me on the sidelines next time if I need to play faster. Believe me, I will. ... You didn't even give me a warning.""

While Williams eventually did grab that set, she again frittered away a 5-3 lead in the second, plus a 4-1 edge in the tiebreaker. When she sat after the second set, the 38-year-old American tossed her racket over her shoulder the way an office worker might flip a crumpled piece of paper toward a trash can.

Williams came out flat in the third set, as if she’d rather be anywhere else. She double-faulted four times in the second game, including on Sakkari’s eighth break chance, to make it 2-0 and that was pretty much that.

Hours earlier, Novak Djokovic’s neck felt much better, and his tennis looked much better, in a 6-2, 6-4 victory over unseeded American Tennys Sandgren that improved the No. 1-ranked man to 20-0 in 2020.

""Actually, I’m pleasantly surprised with the way I recovered and felt today — just overall, physically, but also with the neck, specifically, because that was a little bit of a concern,"" said Djokovic, who will be eyeing his 18th Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open. ""Going back four, five days, I did struggle quite a lot.""

Djokovic was treated by a trainer and played sluggishly in his opening match Monday, but he was at his best from the outset against Sandgren and saved all four break points he faced.

Djokovic will face 34th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff in the quarterfinals. The other quarterfinal in the top half of the draw will be defending champion Daniil Medvedev against No. 8 seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Reilly Opelka, a 6-foot-11 American who is ranked 39th, delivered 19 aces and knocked off 2019 U.S. Open semifinalist Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 7-6 (4). Opelka next meets No. 4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, whose 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4) win over No. 16 John Isner was interrupted by a rain delay of nearly 1 1/2 hours late in the first set.

Also interrupted by the weather was Raonic's victory over the three-time Grand Slam champion. Raonic, a Wimbledon runner-up in 2016, has held all 29 games he’s served so far in the tournament.

""I have done the work,"" Raonic said. ""I have put in the effort, and I'm just happy that this quickly the pieces are coming together.""

This was Murray's first tournament appearance since November. He missed time due to a pelvic injury and is playing on a metal hip after two operations on that joint.

""Didn’t play well. It was not a good day,"" Murray said. ""The positives are that I got three matches in. Physically, I pulled up OK.""

Women’s quarterfinal matchups set earlier in the day were two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka against Anett Kontaveit, former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka against Ons Jabeur, and 83rd-ranked American qualifier Jessica Pegula against No. 14 Elise Mertens.

PFC’s other game was also decided by a late goal. Not that this has been unusual in the whiplash last stages of many of the CPL games in the Charlottetown, P.E.I. “bubble.” According to league statistics provided Monday, 12 goals have been scored among the eight teams after the 85th minute of play. That has happened in nine of the 13 games played so far. Six of those late tallies have been tying goals or game winners, including in all three PFC fixtures. That’s what you call cutting it close.

The whistle-beaters continued Sunday as FC Edmonton scored at 88 minutes and again in injury time to salvage 2-2 draw against Atletico Ottawa while Cavalry FC and HFX exchanged goals at 90 minutes and in injury time in a 2-1 Cavalry victory. Both those results were PFC-friendly in the standings.

But PFC’s own dramatic outcomes have been a mixed blessing for the club. The one against York9 accounted for a draw in injury time for the Island team and the other two in a late draw for HFX Wanderers and a soul-sucking 2-1 loss Saturday against defending CPL-champion Forge FC of Hamilton as 18-time Canada capped Kyle Bekker buried the last-gasp winner in the 97th minute.

That makes tonight’s Pacific FC game against Valour FC of Winnipeg (1-1-1) at 5 p.m. PDT in Charlottetown especially crucial. PFC has four games remaining with the bottom-six teams tightly bunched as they try to join runaway leaders Forge FC and Calgary’s Cavalry FC in the hunt for the four berths into the playoff group stage. Saturday’s loss at the death against Forge is the kind that can rip the heart out of a team, especially in such an abbreviated season format.

“Our guys don’t want to be the team that loses two games straight,” said PFC head coach Pa-Modou Kah, in his Zoom interview with reporters Monday.

“You can see it in their faces. Our group is in a good state. We’re ready.”

The game will be especially personal for PFC’s Marco Bustos, the Canada-capped striker who scored seven goals last season for Valour FC. Bustos has one of Pacific FC’s four goals this season. But any more motivation isn’t needed in this situation, indicated Kah.

“This is not Bustos versus Valour. It’s PFC versus Valour,” said the Pacific bench boss.

A similar storyline, this one in reverse direction, is being written by another Canada-capped player who also has one of the quad of goals for PFC so far. Midfielder Jamar Dixon has returned to play for an Island team after two breakout seasons in the PDL early in his career with the Victoria Highlanders.

“It’s fantastic, like nothing has changed,” he said, of his return to the Island, during the extended PFC training camp over the spring and summer amid the pandemic.

“My first stint [in Victoria with the Highlanders] gave me my start and that really meant something to me. It’s a special place. The people supported me there. It’s a great atmosphere for sports in Victoria.”

On another Island on the other coast, Dixon contributed PFC’s goal Saturday against Forge F.C. The Tridents will need more of that production today — from Dixon, Bustos or anybody — as it looks to rattle a tight table.

There will be doubters, those who view the Canucks’ win over the Blues as a random act and not the work of a legitimate contender.","GAME DAY: VANCOUVER VS. LAS VEGAS, GAME 1

After the final buzzer sounds, coaches go through a ritual of searching the game sheet for statistical trends that reflect positively on an aspect of their team’s performance.

article continues below

Some nights — and the Vancouver Canucks have had a lot over the past five years — that search is a painful exercise. But after Friday night’s series-clinching win over the St. Louis Blues, Travis Green didn’t have to look hard to find things that pleased him.

The Canucks head coach could point to two five-on-five goals by his nominal fourth line, a goal from the third line, and another goal from a five-man mix-and-match configuration of Elias Pettersson, J.T. Miller, Brandon Sutter, Quinn Hughes and Troy Stecher.

He could point to Pettersson’s two assists, which left him tied for the NHL’s post-season scoring lead with Colorado’s Nathan MacKinnon, or the goal and assist from Jay Beagle, who is not tied for the scoring lead.

Then there were the 27 shots his team blocked, seven by Alex Edler, which isn’t surprising, and one by Brock Boeser, which is. Or the 34 saves on 36 shots by goalie Jacob Markstrom. Or Edler’s 24:46 of ice time after he missed the third period of Game 5 of the series with a ghastly cut to his ear. Or a rock-solid 18:33 for Jordie Benn, who was in quarantine two weeks ago.

Green, in short, could find some contribution from every player in his lineup and, on this night, the healthy scratches probably had a big game as well.

“To beat a team like (the Blues) or to have success in the playoffs, you have to have contributions throughout your lineup,” Green said after the Canucks 6-2 win. “With our team, every night someone is stepping up. That’s what we love about our team.”

And it could be others are starting to love the Canucks as well.

Friday night, the too-young, too-inexperienced Canucks dispatched the defending Stanley Cup champs with a comprehensive, top-to-bottom performance that put an exclamation mark on their series win. There were big things — Markstrom and Pettersson — and little things the shot blocks and the resuscitation of Jake Virtanen.

But the sum total of the past 10 days is the Canucks seem to have announced themselves as one of the NHL’s good young teams and a threat this playoff season.

That, at least, was the message out of their post-game Zoom session. And after Game 6, who could argue with them?

“You figure out what it takes to win in the playoffs and the only way to do that is be in the playoffs,” said Beagle, whose post-season pedigree showed in this series. “It’s a great learning experience, but I’ve said from the beginning this is a special and dangerous team.”

Especially when players like Tyler Motte scored as many goals in the final two games of the series (4) as he did in the regular season.

“It’s the commitment,” said Motte. “It’s the will to pay the price. You see a lot of guys blocking shots, some guys you don’t expect. (Boeser) had a couple tonight. (Hughes) had a few in Game 5.

“Guys are laying it on the line. They’re committed to the D-zone and that’s what it takes to win.”

OK, it helps when you’ve got the goalie — and over the life of the series, Markstrom was the biggest difference between the two teams. HIs triple-crown numbers don’t exactly jump out at you. But he’s the only goalie in the post-season with seven wins and turned the series against the Blues when he stole Game 5.

Night-in, night-out, he provides a baseline performance that gives the Canucks a chance to win. He’s also the best goalie still standing in the West and that will be the Canucks’ edge against the Vegas Golden Knights in the next round.

“There’s a lot of things that go into it,” Beagle said of Markstrom. “But elite goaltending, that’s something that’s huge. That’s your backbone and we have that with Marky.”

“It’s just so much fun to play hockey right now,” said Markstrom. “You win a series like this and it’s pure joy. This is a stepping zone. Now we need to take a couple more steps.”

It also helps that Pettersson has quietly driven the offence in his first exposure to the grind of playoff hockey.

“I don’t think he’s under the radar,” Green said of the 21-year-old centre. “I think he’s front and centre. Teams are trying to get their best guys out against him. We’re playing him with different guys. But he’s more than capable of playing against anyone in the league.”

And now he and his colleagues face the Knights, a team which, theoretically, is faster and deeper than the Blues. There will be doubters, those who view the Canucks’ win over the Blues as a random act and not the work of a legitimate contender.

But those doubters don’t exist in the Canucks’ dressing room."

Now Pacific FC must find a way to respond to its dramatic, last-gasp 2-1 loss to defending CPL-champion Forge FC deep into injury time Saturday in Charlottetown, P.E.I.

“This is a tough one to swallow for the boys, who did everything we asked of them, and it will sting over the next couple of hours,” said PFC head coach Pa-Modou Kah.

“It’s a tough one to take but we will take it. They are the champions and we want to be the champions one day. That is a lesson learned. But tomorrow is a bright new day and we are still in the race and have four more games.”

Kyle Bekker showed why he earned 18 caps for Canada by burying the winning goal in injury time at 97 minutes to give Forge FC victory at the death.

Island-based PFC had hit the Hamilton team’s crossbar at the other end just before Forge FC stormed back the other way in the strategic, yet darting, affair. “We have a good level of fitness and we talked about finishing our chances at the end of games. We dug deep,” said Bekker.

“Pacific FC is a good team and never stopped playing. Salvaging three points is a lot better than one.”

As the defending league champions, Forge FC certainly don’t need gifts to thrive. But they were handed one, with a bow on it, by a glaring giveaway by PFC goalkeeper Nolan Wirth at 18 minutes. He passed the ball directly to opponent Chris Nanco, who made Wirth pay by finding the far side off the post and in for the early lead. It was Wirth’s second gaffe of the season, both of which have cost PFC dearly. A ball-dribbling error by the Comox Valley product led to a foul in the box and penalty-kick goal by the HFX Wanderers in a 2-2 draw last week.

Pacific FC, however, pulled level on some poor clearing by Forge FC when Canada-capped former Victoria Highlanders star Jamar Dixon scored at 26 minutes.

“We are disappointed, for sure,” said Dixon, of the ultimate result.

“We are pleased with some of the stuff we did. If we do what we do, we should get [future] results. But Bekker put his chance away today. That’s just the [nature of] the game.”

Forge FC and 2019 runner-up Cavalry FC of Calgary have proven themselves the gold standards of the CPL with the Hamilton club (2-0-2) leap-frogging the fellow-undefeated Calgary team (2-0-1) and into first place to practically cement a top-four placing to see them through to the group stage.

“That is an excellent Pacific FC squad. But we have the will and desire of champions and did not want to settle for the draw,” said Forge FC head coach Bobby Smyrniotis.

“Sometimes it comes early, sometimes it comes late, like today. Our guys have lived a lot of moments together last season and now this season.”

PFC, now with a loss and two draws, saw on Saturday what it will take to get to the level of Forge and Cavalry.

“It’s hard to win a championship. Most guys go through their whole careers without winning one. We have that experience,” said Bekker.

“We have a massive core group returning, with only a few new faces, and that helped to hit the ground running this year.”

Pacific FC meets third-place Valour FC of Winnipeg (1-1-1) in what is looming as a crucial game Tuesday at 5 p.m. PDT in the Charlottetown “bubble.”

“They are the defending champions for a reason,” said Pacific FC head coach Pa-Modou Kah.

“They are a very well-coached team and are the champions and have shown it so far. They play nice football. This will be a test for us to see where we stand. This is a game we have been looking forward to.”

The PFC versus Forge FC contest today at 1 p.m. PDT will be broadcast nationally on CBC as part of the CPL’s “Island Games” tournament-format 2020 pandemic season being held amid a bubble in Charlottetown, P.E.I.

Both teams have yet to lose, although Pacific FC has also yet to win. PFC goes in with draws against the HFX Wanderers of Halifax and York9 of the Greater Toronto Area. Forge FC has a victory over FC Edmonton and draws against HFX and 2019 league-finalist Cavalry FC of Calgary.

Forge and Cavalry have proven themselves the gold standards of the CPL since 2019. The current second-place Hamilton club will be looking for three points today to leap-frog the undefeated and leading Calgary team (2-0-1) and into first place to practically cement a top-four seeding to see them through to the group playoff stage.

With only three points separating the other six teams, PFC will be looking to not only deny Forge FC’s ambitions today, but to also pick up some crucial points of its own.

“Every point matters,” said Kah.

“This is a tournament [not a full season].”

Pacific FC will have its hands full against the wiles of Forge FC veterans David Edgar and Kyle Bekker, who have 42 and 18 caps, respectively, for Canada.

Meanwhile, Kah was asked about PFC strikers Alejandro Diaz and Terran Campbell. The former Mexican U-20 player Diaz, now 24, came as a touted off-season signing. Campbell scored 11 goals last season as a rookie revelation for PFC and was tied as runner-up for the CPL Golden Boot. Both have yet to score this season. But Kah said he is not concerned. The goals will come from the pair, be believes. The PFC bench boss added they also do so much else well.

“Diaz played for one of the biggest teams in North America [Club America of Mexico City],” noted Kah.

“And Terran [Campbell] has done everything we have asked of him. He has put in the work and the goals will come. For us, it doesn’t matter who scores the goals.”

Kah has started Campbell alongside Marco Bustos — the six-time Canada capped striker who scored seven times last year for Valour FC of Winnipeg — in both PFC games. Bustos has one of PFC’s three goals on the season. Diaz subbed in for Campbell in the second half of both contests. At the other end, Kah knows his backline will be put under considerable strain by a pressing Forge side. He cited the defending skills of 56-time Canada-capped Marcel de Jong, a veteran with lengthy experience in the Bundesliga and MLS, and emerging 21-year-old sophomore Kadin Chung.

“Marcel de Jong is the best player in the CPL,” said Kah.

“And Kadin Chung is one of the best fullbacks in the league. He is an example of the modern-day fullback.”

That modern game demands of fullbacks that they also quickly get the ball moving downfield, which both Chung and de Jong can do, with de Jong launching several audacious and on-target, lengthy crosses Tuesday in the draw against York9.

Forge FC did not lose in four meetings against PFC last year with three wins and a draw.

Authorities implored coastal residents of Texas and Louisiana to evacuate and worried that not enough had fled.

The storm grew nearly 70% in power in just 24 hours to a size the National Hurricane Center called ""extremely dangerous."" Drawing energy from the warm Gulf of Mexico waters, the system was on track to arrive late Wednesday or early Thursday as the most powerful hurricane to strike the U.S. so far this year.

""It looks like it’s in full beast mode,"" said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy. ""Which is not what you want to see if you’re in its way.""

One major Louisiana highway already had standing water as Laura's outer bands moved ashore. Winds began picking up as shoppers rushed into a grocery store in low-lying Delcambre, filling carts with chips and beer. Austin Domingues, 26, said his wife would likely evacuate, but he planned to stay put at his father's farm, where the house is 14 feet off the ground.

""I don’t know if it’s too smart, but we’re going to stay just in case we need to help people out,"" he said.

With time running out, both Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards expressed concerns that not enough coastal residents were taking the dire predictions seriously. In Lake Charles, National Guard members drove school buses around neighbourhoods, offering to pick up families.

Abbott warned that families who do not get out of harm's way could be cut off from help long after the storm makes landfall overnight.

The National Hurricane Center kept raising its estimate of Laura's storm surge, from 10 feet just a couple of days ago to twice that size — a height that forecasters said would be especially deadly.

A Category 4 hurricane can cause damage so catastrophic that power outages may last for months in places, and wide areas could be uninhabitable for weeks or months. The threat of such devastation posed a new disaster-relief challenge for a government already straining to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.

By Wednesday afternoon, Laura had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (225 kph) as it churned about 200 miles (320 kilometres) from Lake Charles, Louisiana, moving northwest at 16 mph (26 kph). Forecasters predict winds will reach at least 145 mph winds but may weaken ever so slightly before landfall.

""Heed the advice of your local authorities. If they tell you to go, go! Your life depends on it today,"" said Joel Cline, tropical program co-ordinator at the National Weather Service. ""It’s a serious day and you need to listen to them.""

On Twitter, President Donald Trump also urged coastal residents to heed local officials. Hurricane warnings were issued from San Luis Pass, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, and reached inland for 200 miles (322 kilometres). Storm surge warnings were in effect from Freeport, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River.

In the largest U.S. evacuation during this pandemic era, more than half a million people were ordered to flee from their homes near the Texas-Louisiana state line, including the Texas cities of Beaumont, Galveston and Port Arthur, and the low-lying Calcasieu and Cameron parishes in southwestern Louisiana, where forecasters said storm surge topped by waves could submerge entire towns.

Edwards lamented that the impending storm meant suspension of community testing for COVID-19 at a crucial time — as elementary and secondary schools in Louisiana are opening and students are returning to college campuses. ""We’re basically going to be blind for this week,"" Edwards said, referring to the lack of testing.

The storm also forced evacuations from an area of the state where there has been a high rate of positive tests.

A National Weather Service meteorologist in Lake Charles, Louisiana — in the bullseye of Laura’s projected path — took to Facebook Live to deliver an urgent warning for people living south of Interstate 10 in southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas.

""Your life will be in immediate and grave danger beginning this evening if you do not evacuate,"" Donald Jones said.

Laura is expected to dump massive rainfall as it moves inland, causing widespread flash flooding in states far from the coast. Flood watches were issued for much of Arkansas, and forecasters said heavy rainfall could arrive by Friday in parts of Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky. Laura is so powerful that it's expected to become a tropical storm again once it reaches the Atlantic Ocean, potentially menacing the Northeast.

Even before dawn Wednesday, officials in Austin said the city had run out of free hotel rooms to offer evacuees and had begun directing families fleeing the storm to a shelter nearly 200 miles farther north. In Texas’ Hardin County, which has more than 57,000 residents along the coast, officials warned that anyone who tried riding out the storm faced days or weeks without electricity.

Becky Clements, 56, evacuated from Lake Charles after hearing that it could suffer a direct hit, almost exactly 15 years after Hurricane Rita destroyed the city. She and her family found an AirBnb hundreds of miles inland.

""The devastation afterward in our town and that whole corner of the state was just awful,"" Clements said. ""Whole communities were washed away, never to exist again. ... So knowing how devastating the storms are, there was no way we were going to stay for this.""

Clements, a church educator, said she fears for her office, which is in a trailer following recent construction.

""I very much anticipate that my office will be gone when I get back. It will be scattered throughout that field.""

The hurricane also threatens a centre of the U.S. energy industry. The government said 84% of Gulf oil production and an estimated 61% of natural gas production were shut down. Nearly 300 platforms have been evacuated. Consumers are unlikely to see big price hikes however, because the pandemic has decimated demand for fuel.

""If Laura moves further west toward Houston, there will be a much bigger gasoline supply problem,"" Oil analyst Andrew Lipow said, since refineries usually take two to three weeks to resume full operations.

Laura closed in on the U.S. after killing nearly two dozen people on the island of Hispaniola, including 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.

Kyle Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, was taken into custody in Illinois on suspicion of first-degree intentional homicide. Antioch is about 15 miles from Kenosha.

Two people were shot to death Tuesday night in an attack carried out by a young white man who was caught on cellphone video opening fire in the middle of the street with a semi-automatic rifle.

""I just killed somebody,"" the gunman could be heard saying at one point during the shooting rampage that erupted just before midnight.

One victim was shot in the head and the other in the chest, Sheriff David Beth told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. A third person suffered gunshot wounds not believed to be life-threatening.

In the wake of the killings, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers authorized 500 members of the National Guard to support local law enforcement around Kenosha, doubling the number of troops sent in. The governor's office said he working other states to bring in additional National Guard troops and law officers.

""We were all chanting ‘Black lives matter’ at the gas station and then we heard, boom, boom, and I told my friend, `‘That’s not fireworks,’"" 19-year-old protester Devin Scott told the Chicago Tribune. ""And then this guy with this huge gun runs by us in the middle of the street and people are yelling, ‘He shot someone! He shot someone!’ And everyone is trying to fight the guy, chasing him and then he started shooting again.""

Scott said he cradled a lifeless victim in his arms, and a woman started performing CPR, but ""I don’t think he made it.""

According to witness accounts and video footage, police apparently let the young man responsible for the shootings walk past them with a rifle over his shoulder as members of the crowd were yelling for him to be arrested because he had shot people.

Much of Rittenhouse’s Facebook page is devoted to praising law enforcement, with references to Blue Lives Matter, a movement that supports police. He also can be seen holding an assault rifle.

Other photographs include those of badges of various law enforcement agencies, including the Chicago Police Department. All of the badges have a black line across them — something police officers do with black tape or another material whenever an officer is killed in the line of duty.

In a photograph posted by his mother, he is wearing what appears to be a blue law enforcement uniform as well as the kind of brimmed hat that state troopers wear.

The sheriff told the Journal Sentinel that armed people had been patrolling the city's streets in recent nights, but he did not know if the gunman was among them.

""They’re a militia,"" Beth said. ""They’re like a vigilante group.""

The FBI said it is assisting in the case.

Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who is Black, said in an interview with the news program ""Democracy Now!"" that the shootings were not surprising and that white militias have been ignored for too long.

""How many times across this country do you see armed gunmen, protesting, walking into state Capitols, and everybody just thinks it’s OK?"" Barnes said. ""People treat that like it’s some kind of normal activity that people are walking around with assault rifles.""

Witness accounts and video show that the shootings took place in two stages: The gunman first shot someone at a car lot, then jogged away, stumbled and fell in the street, and opened fire again as members of the crowd closed in him.

A witness, Julio Rosas, 24, said that when the gunman stumbled, ""two people jumped onto him and there was a struggle for control of his rifle. At that point during the struggle, he just began to fire multiple rounds and that dispersed people near him.""

""The rifle was being jerked around in all directions while it was being fired,"" Rosas said.

Sam Dirks, 22, from Milwaukee, said he had seen the suspected gunman earlier in the evening, and he was yelling at some of the protesters.

""He was definitely very agitated. He was pacing around, just pointing his gun in general. Not necessarily at anyone specifically,"" Dirks said.

In other widely circulating video, police can be seen tossing bottled water from an armoured vehicle to what appear to be armed civilians walking the streets. One of the civilians appears to be the gunman who later shot protesters.

""We appreciate you being here,"" an officer is heard saying to the group over a loudspeaker.

In Wisconsin, it is legal for people 18 and over to openly carry a gun, with no license required.

Blake, 29, was shot, apparently in the back, on Sunday as he leaned into his SUV, three of his children seated inside. Kenosha police have said little about what happened other than that they were responding to a domestic dispute. They have not said why the officers opened fire or whether Blake was armed, and they have not disclosed the race of three officers on the scene.

On Tuesday, Ben Crump, the lawyer for Blake’s family, said it would ""take a miracle"" for Blake to walk again. He called for the officer who opened fire to be arrested and for the others involved to lose their jobs.

The shooting was captured on cellphone video and ignited new protests in the U.S. three months after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer touched off a nationwide reckoning over racial injustice.

During the unrest in Kenosha since then, protesters destroyed dozens of buildings, set fires and hurled objects at police, who responded with tear gas on three straight nights.

""The bullying has to stop,"" wrote Vacious.

But when it comes time to book, King would rather see the world from the comfort of his home in Guelph, Ont.

""I can have a little espresso at my desk, and look all this stuff up, and it often feels like I've travelled there,"" King, 77, said in a recent phone interview.

""If I don't travel again, I don't know that I'll miss it.""

This weariness of wanderlust animates King's new novel, ""Indians on Vacation,"" which hit shelves Tuesday.

The story follows Canadian couple Mimi and Bird on a peripatetic mission across Europe to recover a family medicine bundle that a long-lost relative absconded with a century earlier.

As they drift from one destination to the next, the two must navigate their conflicting tourist temperaments.

Mimi, with her trusty guidebook in hand, believes that travel is ""broadening."" Meanwhile, Bird, like the book's author, is skeptical that there's much to be gained by straying too far from home.

""When we travel, a lot of times, the thing we come away with is we've been entertained,"" said King.

""I don't know that we feel any differently towards the people that we see on our travels. We find them interesting, sometimes even exotic. And for a moment, perhaps we have a kind of broadening. But I think by the time people get home, that's tightened up again.""

If anything, travel can show that prejudice knows no borders, said King, who was born in the U.S. and is of Greek and Cherokee descent.

From mountain towns to major cities, King said he's often confronted by racist stereotypes of Indigenous Peoples while abroad, including a photographer in France who asked him to pose with a pool stick as if it were a spear.

""What they want is that inauthentic historical image that Hollywood has made up over the years,"" said King.

""It's always the one kind of Indian they've got because the others don't play well visually. Me in a T-shirt and a pair of walking shorts — God forbid anybody see me in walking shorts — that just doesn't do it.""

In writing ""Indians on Vacation,"" King said he wanted to ""play against type"" by depicting Indigenous characters who are well-off enough to travel the world, while still engaging with the historic inequities that have made such portrayals a rarity in popular culture.

As the COVID-19 pandemic has closed down borders, King won't have to endure airplane food, forced photo-ops or guided walking tours any time soon.

But he still longs for a time when he could plan his dream vacation — then decide not to take it of his own accord.

""I don't need to go to Ireland,"" King said. ""But I don't like the fact that I can't.""

The lengthy report from the Special Investigations Unit notes that Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked ""important conversations"" about the ways in which police interact with Black and Indigenous people, but says there was no evidence of police wrongdoing or ""overt"" racism in the incident itself.

article continues below

Director Joseph Martino said race may have been a factor in the events leading up to the death of the 29-year-old, who was both Indigenous and Black, but that examining systemic issues in policing is not his role.

""The task before me was a narrow one — namely, to determine whether there were reasonable grounds, on the evidence collected by the SIU, to believe that any one or more of the officers who responded to Ms. Korchinski-Paquet's apartment committed a criminal offence in connection with her death,"" he wrote.

The Special Investigations Unit said six officers were in the 29-year-old woman's Toronto home when she fell from the balcony in May, while her mother and brother were nearby.

The agency's report says Korchinski-Paquet's mother called police to the home because the two siblings were fighting — ""bottles and punches had been thrown"" — and she wanted both of them removed from the apartment.

It says Korchinski-Paquet and her brother also called 911 during the argument, which began as a dispute over the volume of the TV.

When the 911 operator asked about any mental health issues, the report says, the family indicated that Korchinski-Paquet had epilepsy and had had seizures earlier in the day.

It says that after police arrived, two officers blocked Korchinski-Paquet from getting to her mother and brother before allowing her back into the apartment so she could use the bathroom.

She then went out onto the 24th-floor balcony and prevented officers from joining her by holding her body against the door.

""Very quickly, Ms. Korchinski-Paquet scaled the balcony railing and the (subject officer) lost sight of her,"" the report reads.

She then tried to scale the balcony and cross onto the adjoining one, which is when she lost her balance and fell to her death, the report reads.

The agency said no officers were on the balcony with Korchinski-Paquet at the time, and there's no evidence the officers committed a crime.

Martino said that the officers seemed to be confused about whether epilepsy was a mental health condition and if they should or could detain Korchinski-Paquet under the Mental Health Act.

""The limited layperson's research I have conducted of the matter suggests that epilepsy is a neurological disorder with manifestations that can be mental as well as physical,"" Martino wrote. ""Be that as it may, I cannot fault the officers for failing to take Ms. Korchinski-Paquet into custody prior to her scaling the balcony railing. She had not given them any indication that she wished to harm herself and was professing to be the victim of an assault at the hands of her brother.""

He also said the officers tried to de-escalate the situation between Korchinski-Paquet's family.

The decision comes after the arm's-length agency interviewed all six officers, along with 15 civilian witnesses.

The agency said investigators also received a written statement from Korchinski-Paquet's father, with whom she had been speaking on the phone moments before her death.

Korchinski-Paquet's death sparked protests in the city and calls to change the way police deal with people experiencing mental health crises.

Martino noted that Korchinski-Paquet died just days after George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, was killed when an officer pressed a knee against his neck for nearly nine minutes, at a time when there was increased scrutiny over the relationship between police and racialized people.

In Toronto, thousands of protesters took to the streets on May 30, three days after the incident in Korchinski-Paquet's apartment. Several smaller marches followed it over the next several weeks.

Two city counsellors then brought forward a motion to defund Toronto police, but it was struck down in favour of introducing body-worn cameras to the force.

The Toronto Police Services Board, the body that oversees the force, then launched a series of town halls to discuss systemic racism in policing, though many protesters said such information-gathering had been done before to little effect.

Toronto police and Korchinski-Paquet’s family were expected to comment on the SIU report at separate news conferences later Wednesday.

Other speakers tonight include senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, who is leaving the White House at the end of the month, and Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn.

A devout Catholic, Pence and wife Karen are expected to carry the evangelical banner into Day 3 of the convention, touting Trump as the best choice for Americans who consider themselves social conservatives.

Democrats seized on the opportunity, deploying the openly gay Pete Buttigieg, one of Joe Biden's former presidential rivals, in a fundraising missive denouncing Pence's ""divisive, anti-LGBTQ politics"" and ""archaic worldview.""

As head of the White House coronavirus force, Pence is also likely to address an issue that has so far received relatively scant attention from convention speakers: the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Tuesday, economic adviser Larry Kudlow spoke of the crisis in the past tense, even though the pandemic continues to rage across the U.S., while only first lady Melania Trump expressed any empathy for the more than 178,000 Americans killed by the virus to date.

""My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one, and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering,"" she said. ""I know many people are anxious, and some feel helpless. I want you to know you are not alone.""

Kudlow, meanwhile, framed the novel coronavirus as ancient history in the U.S.

""It was awful — health and economic impacts were tragic, hardship and heartbreak were everywhere,"" Kudlow said. ""But presidential leadership came swiftly and effectively, with an extraordinary rescue for health and safety to successfully fight the COVID virus.""

Of the racial unrest roiling the country — fuelled this week by another police shooting of an unarmed Black man, this time in Wisconsin — Melania Trump urged protesters to channel their furious energy into positive change, not wanton destruction. She also resisted the urge to ""divide the country further"" by beating up on Democrats.

But she raised eyebrows by framing her husband, notorious for playing fast and loose with the truth, as an honest and authentic human being.

""Total honesty is what we as citizens deserve from our president,"" she said. ""Whether you like it or not, you always know what he's thinking.""

Trump has been putting the power of the presidency under a brazen partisan spotlight, and did so again Tuesday, pardoning a convicted bank robber who now helps prisoners reintegrate into society and presiding over a naturalization ceremony for five new American citizens. His wife's speech was delivered from the White House Rose Garden.

And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's pre-taped speech from a Jerusalem rooftop, coming in the middle of a diplomatic mission, did not escape the attention of some members of Congress. Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is accusing Pompeo of violating federal law by mixing government business with partisan interests.

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""","INVERMAY, Sask. — People could always tell when Aaron Ogden entered a room.

The 19-year-old had a big presence, said his father, Mark Ogden. He was a prankster, a one-of-a-kind character who would sit and talk to anybody as if he'd known them for years.

article continues below

""He wasn't afraid to make friends,"" Ogden, 50, said in a phone interview. ""This is just the way he was.

""Really easy to talk to.""

People remembered the young man's outgoing personality at his funeral this week. He died in a Calgary hospital last Saturday after collapsing on a run.

His father, a trucker, was able to be by his son's side.

He said a major blood clot had formed around a stent placed in his son's aorta. The stent was necessary after he survived a serious highway accident on his way to work last year.

""It was a miracle, really.""

Ogden said while in hospital before his death, his son told him he was supposed to go for a CT scan in June while still living in Saskatchewan near Yorkton.

It was a routine checkup on the stent, but the appointment was postponed because of restrictions around the COVID-19 pandemic and never rescheduled.

""I didn't think nothing of it at the time, but I mulled it over ... as we watched him decline,"" Ogden said.

""It hit me. He was trying to tell me: 'This shouldn't have happened.'""

The father believes that had his son's scan not been cancelled, doctors might have found the blood clot in time.

Ogden wants all postponed hospital procedures done immediately.

""People's lives are being lost,"" he said. ""These COVID rules are way too far.""

Ogden believes the Saskatchewan Health Authority bears responsibility for his son's death.

""Somebody needs to be held to account.""

The health authority halted hundreds of non-urgent surgeries, procedures and diagnostics in March to brace for the pandemic.

Two months later, when the government felt it had a handle on the spread of the novel coronavirus, it announced the resumption of health services would be staggered.

""Emergency and urgent patients are the priority for services, including diagnostic imaging,"" said Corey Miller, vice-president of provincial programs at the health authority.

""The determination of the priority is based on the evaluation of the referring physician in consultation with the patient.""

Miller said they are reviewing Ogden's case and have reached out to his family.

He said the health authority is working through the backlog of exams that were delayed during the first few months of the pandemic.

More than 1,500 CT appointments which had been booked were postponed, he said.

Ogden questions why something like a CT scan couldn't be performed in Yorkton, where the risk of COVID-19 was low.

As of Friday, health officials reported five active cases in the region, which has only seen 33 infections in total since the pandemic hit Saskatchewan.

Cheryl Camillo, a professor with the University of Regina's Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy, says speaking generally, delaying non-essential services to respond to COVID-19 was the responsible thing to do because the virus was new and spreading quickly.

""The risks are that some people don't get the essential and urgent services because so much of the workforce and the resources of the health system move towards responding to COVID,"" said the health systems researcher.

""It's very human for people to get frustrated because health care is something that is so personal.""

She says another risk of scaling back is that people can lose confidence in a health system some may perceive as having overplanned for the pandemic.

Health officials are in the tough spot of having to prepare for the worst case scenario and what could be a rapid change in case numbers, she says.

During the pandemic Camillo's own grandmother died in a long-term care home in the United States from isolation and depression, she says.

""I suffered an individual loss of my otherwise pretty healthy grandmother, but despite how profoundly sad that makes me, I understand and would defend the care home's decision to lock down.

""It is the responsibility of public health officials to protect public health.""

Loblaw Companies Ltd., which began offering COVID-19 testing for patients at a handful of its Alberta pharmacy locations in June, plans to expand the program to all 234 of its pharmacies in the province by Sept. 1.

article continues below

The company says it has reached out to all 10 provinces to discuss in-store testing outside Alberta, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford this week acknowledging the possibility.

The swab tests are only for those with no symptoms or any known contact with coronavirus patients and may be useful for teachers returning to school or Canadians who take care of an older family member, said Theresa Firestone, head of health and wellness at Shoppers Drug Mart. Loblaw-owned pharmacy locations include Shoppers stores as well as Independent Foods and No Frills.

""It's very convenient. We're in every community. The other plus is they don't have to line up with people who may have symptoms. We've shared that with Ontario and with other provinces, so at this point we’re looking forward to what they may decide,"" Firestone said.

London Drugs also conducts COVID-19 tests in Alberta. It began offering the service at six locations during the past two weeks and plans to roll it out at nine more by October. Like Shoppers, it bills Alberta Health Services for testing costs.

The service builds on other responses to the pandemic such as online pharmacist consultations and a pilot program where patients consult virtually with doctors in a private room in the store.

London Drugs is among the pharmacy retailers beefing up their role in a health-care system grappling with an aging population.

""With the extended hours of operation, you can basically go in when our stores are open and be able to find a pharmacist to ask a question. So what we’re able to do at that point is basically help triage the system,"" said Chris Chiew, head of pharmacy at the Richmond, B.C.-based retailer.

London Drugs has also hired diabetes educators to test blood sugar levels and assist patients with weight management and diet.

Shoppers has stepped even further into the realm of physicians, opening one of three planned medical clinics with doctors who cater to a roster of patients and walk-in services.

""There are a number of Canadians who don’t have access to a family physician. And we thought there was an opportunity for us to really play a role here in terms of access,"" Firestone said.

Drugstores can also handle the bureaucratic side of health care, freeing up doctors to spend more time with patients, she said.

""Looking for PPE (personal protective equipment), sorting out their waiting rooms so that people are socially distanced, managing virtual care...we’re able to take that burden on for them,"" Firestone said.

In 2018, Shoppers launched its Wellwise store chain to sell assisted-living devices aimed at older Canadians. More recently, it began to offer tips and videos online designed to help ward off depression and anxiety.

Metro Inc. declined to comment on any attempts to provide COVID-19 testing. The bulk of the company's Jean Coutu drugstores are located in Quebec, which unlike some provinces does not allow pharmacists to conduct testing via nose and mouth swabs.

Bank of Nova Scotia. (TSX:BNS). Down 38 cents, or 0.67 per cent, to $56.10. The Bank of Nova Scotia's profit was weighed down in its latest quarter by mounting provisions for bad loans and its Latin American operations. The Toronto-based bank revealed Tuesday that its third-quarter profit slipped to $1.3 billion from $1.98 billion a year ago, while its provisions for credit losses totalled $2.18 billion for the quarter, up from $1.85 billion last quarter and $713 million in the year prior. ""We know that structural damage has been done to the economy. It's going to require a lot of quarters of clean up from here, but we do view this quarter's PCL as our high-water mark,"" Daniel Moore, the bank's chief risk officer, said during a conference call with financial analysts.

Bank of Montreal (TSX:BMO). Up $4.38 cents, or 5.7 per cent, to $81.23. BMO Financial Group put aside a hefty amount of money again to protect itself from bad loans even as it posted a $1.23-billion profit in its latest quarter. The Toronto-based bank said Tuesday that provisions for credit losses amounted to $1.05 billion in its third quarter, up from $306 million last year and down from $1.11 billion last quarter. Patrick Cronin, the bank's chief risk officer, attributed the high provisions to the COVID-19 pandemic, but said he has confidence in the bank's ability to operate in such an environment.

The Canadian Association of Broadcasters issued a report on Wednesday warning of potential closures and widespread job cuts as private TV and radio broadcasters face a cumulative projected revenue shortfall of up to $1.06 billion by the end of 2022.

Most vulnerable are the country's AM radio stations, the report said, as well as other independent private radio and TV operations in smaller markets across the country.

The study, titled ""The Crisis in Canadian Media and the Future of Local Broadcasting,"" was commissioned by the CAB, which represents the majority of private broadcasters in Canada, and conducted through Winnipeg-based independent media economics consultancy Communications Management Inc.

The CAB says it's concerned about the fallout from a substantial erosion in local advertising revenues over recent months.

Radio stations may be hardest hit in the short term, the report suggests, partly due to many advertisers pulling back on their spending in the pandemic and hastening a decline in the media industry's revenues.

Private radio ad revenues are expected to be $383 million below last year, it said.

The report's projections suggest that without further government support those declines could mean as many as 50 private local radio stations go out of business over the next four to six months.

Another 150 radio stations could topple in the 18 months that follow, it said, leading to as many as 2,000 job losses.

TV stations could risk a similar fate with roughly 40 of Canada's 94 private TV broadcasters in danger of closing within one to three years, the research predicts.

The CAB is calling on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to take swift action by establishing a ""more fair and sustainable future"" for local media.

Last month, the organization sent an emergency application to the CRTC requesting permission for broadcasters to be relieved of certain terms of their agreements, such as spending requirements on Canadian programming, for the broadcast year that ends Aug. 31.

Lenore Gibson, chair of the CAB, said broadcasters have ""done their utmost to cut expenses"" in areas such as administration, and ""the last thing that they want to do is cut into programming costs, but that's the only area that's left now.""

The CAB is urging the federal government to provide emergency regulatory relief as well as greater ""targeted support"" for the industry starting this fall.

Without greater financial measures in place, the CAB says the effects could leave many communities with only national and international media organizations to provide them with most of their news, effectively eliminating most community coverage of local politics, health and education in some regions of the country.
